the Council , and not just the Member States , adopts .
That might also be the way to establish a coordinated presence of the monetary Union as such in institutional decision-making forums like the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank and , in addition , the relations of the eurozone with third countries , in particular with the producer countries of raw materials and energy sources .
A consistent political strategy is necessary .
So it is useful for the European Parliament to be present at every stage , including the stages preceding election observation in the strict sense , and it is desirable - where the right conditions exist - to have the European Union mission led by a Member of Parliament .
First , elections and regional elections may not be sufficient parameters for recognising when it is appropriate to intervene .
We want to continue to make our resources available , and not just economic resources but the resources of our democratic heritage and our political commitment as well .
Rather , the Commission is called upon to work alongside the US Government .
I do not think it is necessary to say anything further on that because the Commission and Parliament have done a great deal of work in that direction in the last few months .
The tie I am wearing this evening bears the emblem of the city of Genoa , so I could hardly refrain from speaking on such an important matter .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mr Purvis on his excellent work in committee .
While making an appeal for the Italian version of the documents to contain the Italian translation of all the terms contained therein - despite my love of the English language , and of French , for that matter - I would like to say that I voted for Mrs Kauppi' s report .
Would it not be simpler to give them a little less money rather than making them pay tax ?
Furthermore , I have to say that I am tired of hearing people say that there is not enough money for pensions because pensioners are living too long .
I did this and , indeed , page 7 , paragraph 12 states that the European Parliament 'insists on the need to adapt the present social security systems with a view to ensuring they perform safely . '
Therefore , the voting rules themselves must be controlled in those States .
As representative of the Pensioners ' Party , I hope that this example will be followed by other interparliamentary assemblies , but I call , in particular , for a Working Party to be set up on the situation , standard of living and problems of the pensioners and elderly people in the ACP States .
Mr Purvis is a living example of this : just by drawing up his report on biotechnology he has become younger , if that is possible , for he is always youthful .
These commitments are a step in the right direction although they are still not a full response .
If new cosmetics are not tested on animals , I would like to make it quite clear that this could lead to potentially toxic risks for men , women and children alike .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mrs Roth-Behrendt on her important work , which I support and admire , which seeks to prevent the use of cosmetics and perfumes leading to animal experimentation .
However , she was wearing night cream which smelt horrible .
Afterwards , she said to me , in some pain : ' Tomorrow , you must vote against my report .
Quite the contrary : the report explicitly calls upon the Commission to tackle the specific problems of this material as part of a broader strategy for plastics and to deal with the issue of differentiated collection as soon as possible from a Europe-wide perspective .
I am absolutely certain that genuinely sustainable development cannot be implemented without dialogue and cooperation with industry .
Mr President , as budget year 2002 is very important - one might even say incredibly important - because of enlargement , which is now entering a crucial phase , and because we have significant problems with the common agricultural policy and have not yet made full use of the Structural Funds , the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism wishes to propose three key points .
Mr President , I would like to start by thanking the rapporteurs for their work .
Madam President , I explained most of my considerations on this report yesterday , but , this morning , I would like to add that the desires and expectations of the left , of the Greens and of Mrs Roth-Behrendt are , in my opinion , destined to remain just desires and expectations .
The Member States must decide whether they want Europe or not , and if they want Europe and consider it useful , they must furnish it with the necessary means for it to run smoothly and properly .
Kauppi report ( A5-0105/2001 ) :
I will willingly contribute to this recycling on condition that my pension is increased " .
I therefore feel that the initiatives implemented to date are not sufficient .
Firstly , the animal health policy adopted by the European Union during the 1990s appears to have been a good one .
We must work towards a situation where companies employ more than the obligatory number of people with disabilities , making things easier for companies by consistently reducing or abolishing both the contribution and tax burdens .
This would have the positive effect of using this social potential , which is currently only partially exploited , and would benefit the entire economy
