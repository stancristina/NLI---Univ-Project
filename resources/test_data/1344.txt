The dialogue , apart from the internal level I mentioned , must also be held on an international scale .
The definition of less ambitious and realistic objectives must relate solely to the Hong Kong conference and not to the Doha round overall .
The democratically legitimate position of the Union was the outcome of the last review of the common agricultural policy .
I refer mainly to the sectors of services , industrial products , the facilitation of trade and the protection of industrial and intellectual property .
I wish you and every success , Mr Mandelson .     . – Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of the European Parliament Committee on Culture and Education , the committee responsible for young people and sport , I particularly welcome today 's debate in plenary on the recent motion for a resolution by the Committee on Culture on the Olympic Truce , in the run-up to the winter Olympic and Paralympic Games in Turin next February .
From the ninth century B.C. , when the institution of the Olympic Truce was born with the signature of a peace treaty between the kings of Sparta , Elis and Pisa , until 393 A.D. , the year in which the Olympic Games were abolished , the Olympic Truce was observed for 12 successive centuries to the degree which it deserves and contributed to respect for the institution of the Olympic Games .
In 1992 , the International Olympic Committee called on the international community to cease all hostilities during the 1992 Olympic Games .
In July 2000 , following the proposal of the Greek Government through the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the time , Georgios Papandreou , who was also the inspiration behind it , we safeguarded the Olympic Truce institutionally with the foundation by the International Olympic Committee and the Greek Government of an International Olympic Truce Centre and an International Olympic Truce Foundation , as a platform for debate with the objective of resolving conflicts and establishing the culture of peace through sport and the Olympic ideal and galvanising people , especially young people , into action .
It is worth pointing out that our honourable friend , Mr Stavros Lambrinidis , was the first director of the International Olympic Truce Centre and coordinator of this endeavour .
This achievement will constitute a small revolution in today 's world .
The Committee on Development chose to carry out this review from the point of view of the contribution of sport to the promotion of education , health , development and peace .
At the same time , in the sector of development , support through continuing training programmes of physical education instructors and sports journalists may have positive results on combating racism and xenophobia and in safeguarding equal opportunities for both sexes .
In addition , the European Union will be the main winner with the efforts it is making to establish peace and progress in the world .
Greece therefore imposed the truce at that time .
The Olympic Games started in 1896 and we saw war stop .
We must therefore protect the Olympic Truce .
The Olympic Truce must come today into our lives , we must convince the big not to wage war on the small .     – Mr President , you cannot play and wage war at the same time .
Today , this romantic idea now has weight .
In 1994 , ten thousand children in Bosnia were vaccinated because there was a day 's truce .
Romantic ?
There is no reason why we should not .
Everyone cannot therefore just engage in personal politics here .
We are complicating things , not facilitating them .
Let us protect the institutions .
At the same time , however , provision is made for derogations and this is where caution is needed , because this will adulterate the severity of the measures .
I also wanted to thank the European Commission for its willingness to cooperate throughout the procedure .
The bone of contention on which my honourable friends focused their attention was scheduled services between ports in different Member States or between the European Union and third countries , especially the conference system .
There are clear tendencies to merge to create colossal companies which can impose their terms and conditions on trade and industry .
It should propose a review of the existing system , mainly by excluding the facility for freight rates to be fixed directly at the conferences , but allowing indicative prices to be set on the basis of the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities and calculating additional loading and despatch charges transparently and following dialogue with shippers .
However , life itself has shown us that the major monopoly business groups which participate in maritime transport have emerged as the winners and the workers have emerged as the losers from this entire procedure .
Today mergers and concentrations of capital in this specific sector have progressed to the point at which , essentially , a few companies – which you can count on the fingers of one hand – control scheduled transport .
Constant tax exemptions for big business and its profits , on the pretext of increasing investments , are accompanied by a simultaneous increase in indirect taxes and a reduction in grass-roots income .
Of course , for the profits of companies a tax cut of 10 percentage points has been promoted .
The fact that the experimental directive allowing a lower rate of VAT for labour-intensive services cannot be applied generally is typical of the uniform strategy of big business and of capitalistic infighting .
