I saw an extremely long queue of pensioners and elderly people .
Madam President , this is a document - which I voted for - which is intended to establish gradually , step by step , a European public prosecution service .
I therefore feel that we should be much more careful in carrying out our financial activities in respect of research programmes than we are at present .
Then there is the whole area of the association agreements , trade issues and the Med programme .
Mr President , five years on from the Barcelona Conference , it is time to take stock of the situation .
The third constraint concerns the regrettable involvement of the European and Mediterranean civil societies in this process , which is still too dominated by centralism and the almost exclusive role of the governments .
The fact that , despite this situation , the 27 partners have confirmed their willingness to meet in Marseilles , at least for the moment , is already in itself an indication that all is not lost , although I agree entirely with Commissioner Patten that the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership policy must not become a hostage to the peace process .
However , first and foremost , we need political strategies which are free of bureaucracy .
It means bringing about the necessary social reforms , focusing on employment , the need to revitalise the economy in the southern countries and the reduction and cancellation of debt as central issues .
It must be resolved , first and foremost , of course , in order to put an end to the suffering of the Palestinian people , but also in order to bring more stability to the region .
But this region , the most troubled region of Europe , has never held such hope as it does now .
Mr President , the proposal under consideration was certainly long-awaited .
However , what we have to decide is whether it responds fully to the aims which , eight years ago , it was hoped to achieve through its promulgation or whether it may create further confusion .
In conclusion , I call upon the Commission to set in motion a coordination project within the framework of existing Community legislation and to make our legislation both more transparent and also genuinely beneficial owing to its certainty .
I told her that she could not go out unaccompanied because it was dangerous .
Most importantly - and here I am addressing the Council representative - how can any safety directives be effectively implemented if the Council refuses to endorse the directive on safety inspections and controls ?
The laws on product safety , in particular the safety of those products which have hitherto escaped regulation by the vertical legislation already governing the matter , is being improved , consolidated and made more transparent .
I did not even receive a courtesy reply to my protest .
I therefore feel that the prejudice shown by Parliament against amendments tabled by certain political parties is evidence of an alarming lack of democracy in this House .
If they do not assume their responsibility and make good their undertaking , there can be no project creating a multilateral sub-regional free trade area in the Mediterranean countries , as proposed at the Malta Conference in the context of south-south relations .
Without joint action there can be no dynamism , and without dynamism there will not be sufficient drive for development .
Mrs Rossi - who is a pensioner , a widow - asked me : " Why is it that , as a widow , the pension I receive is only half the amount that it used to be when my dear husband was alive ? " .
The quota system must be entirely abolished ; we must find a different way of assisting agriculture , fisheries and livestock farmers in the European Union .
Mr President , I voted for the motion and I was pleased to see that an amendment was adopted recognising the genocide of the Armenian people .
The Union must be more proactive and treat enlargement to include Turkey as a vital geopolitical strategy .
I would like to thank Mr Rocard for his initiative .
Why is it , as happened to me when I went to visit my dear mother - who is still alive , thank God - in a major public hospital in Rome , that we see people who are dying accommodated in the same wards as other patients who are happily eating their lunch or supper ?
We call for financial subsidies to assist breeders so that they do not have to bear all the costs of the crisis .
I am sure , Commissioner , that Parliament will lend you all the support necessary for the new initiatives .
However , the figures on poverty in Europe , upon which our report is based and which have been mentioned today - the 18 % poverty line - are evidence of a situation which is anything but exciting .
If we want there to be more jobs , we must have the courage to liberalise the labour market .
If only we could reduce the scale !
I therefore support the rapporteur in stressing that the programme , or rather the programme 's role , will facilitate greater social cohesion where the poor and the marginalised are concerned .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the use of sustainable renewable energy sources must be one of the principle objectives of a modern energy policy in Europe as well , but there must also be obligations and certainties , dictated by common sense , of course .
