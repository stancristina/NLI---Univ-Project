Now for my second point : you prioritised communication with the public , and that , too , is something we think is a good thing ; we are glad that you are doing this , for , if the EU loses its basis and fails to build a citizens ' Europe , then it will not achieve anything worth mentioning either .
Our view is that what innovation needs most of all is freedom and the right conditions rather than institutions and more support measures , which tend to take us in the wrong direction .
What people need is real projects and initiatives ; that is why we have to address the real issues .
As well as the one-sided Lisbon Strategy , the Gothenburg strategy is also to be treated in isolation , with economic growth being treated as having higher priority than sustainable development in what is a completely backward-looking policy that represents the selling out of our living resources and amounts to writing off our rural areas , thus abandoning the interconnection of our economic , social and environmental goals .
Madam President , Mr Davies , the Commission attaches great importance to the voluntary commitment on the part of the automobile industry to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars .
Incidentally , we should also pay greater attention to the other two main components of the strategy : labelling of and tax concessions for low CO2 emission vehicles .
The Commission 's proposal provides for a reduction to 200 milligrams per kilometre and is currently being debated in Parliament .
All of them have made great contributions to our success .
I believe that the Commission can provide an important answer to these questions today .
( Applause ) The Council common position largely takes account of the fundamental amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading .
Anyone who so much as attempts to threaten this state or call into question its right to exist will face opposition from all Europeans .
No social democrat anywhere in the world has anything in common with Mr Liebermann .
Things cannot carry on like this .
From a social democrat point of view , however , there still remain a few controversial items outstanding .
Combining police , military and judicial functions in this way is a blatant violation of treaties currently in force , and it also gives rise to additional security problems ; it is the very approach taken by President Bush , Dick Cheney and the now-departed Rumsfeld .
That is no way to get our message across to people , and I have to say that , if what we are trying to do is to get people more involved , then the Commission 's new communications strategy is not going to achieve that .
I do not , however , want to demand too much of you , for you have at least taken the right step in the right direction , and even if Ireland were to ratify now , that would get us little further down the road , but , in any case , nineteen out of twenty-seven states would then have ratified it , and the fact that eighteen already have done so or are about to do so means that we can and must take note that the majority of the Member States of the European Union want what is in the Constitution , while those who do not are in the minority .
Either Polish meat is bad , in which case Mr Putin is right and this meat must no longer be distributed in Europe .
It is because we in the Commission regard your House as the most important of partners that we unreservedly stand by our statement on democratic scrutiny and coherence of external actions and will maintain regular dialogue with your House .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by expressing my gratitude not only for the debate but also for the many sessions of negotiation in which we have eventually arrived at a good compromise .
We were able to introduce specific regulations for the field of automotive engineering , which includes airbags and seatbelt pretensioners .
The first signal is that , for the first time , we actually have a functioning mechanism in Europe to coordinate the economic policies of the Member States and the EU itself .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , there are two more things I should like to say .
It is for these reasons that I have been unable to vote in favour of these reports today .
The belief that REACH would be a problem for large-scale industry in Europe was always a misconception , albeit one propagated by some environmental organisations .
The best proof of its being a good one is probably that nobody ends up being really satisfied .
Let me conclude by saying that , if we are serious about this - and to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten as much as to anyone else , I emphasise the 'if' - then we will make sure that a good and effective agency is in place without delay .
At the same time , I should like to attach particular importance to answering all the questions that have been asked here about support for European SMEs and a relaxation of the requirements imposed on them , and about the many hundreds of thousands of employees affected . on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to start by expressing my sincere thanks to all my fellow Members who have cooperated on this difficult dossier ; above all Mrs Fourtou , who has fought her way through this complex set of rules with great success .
That would be a good time and opportunity to discuss further-reaching changes to
