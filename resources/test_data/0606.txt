That would be the wrong route to take .
Similarly , in other contexts we have touched on collection rules which are too unclear , and reclaiming .
Can things really be so bad in the Commission ?
Clearly the Commission does not dare look the citizens in the eye and explain that 'this has gone wrong , we made a mistake here , but we tried to achieve this in this way . '
This story has been going on for almost ten years .
The Green Group in the European Parliament is going to support Mrs Wemheuer 's report to the letter .
I would like , in particular , to emphasize the principle of caution , that is , that there should be a good margin for workers being exposed to risks .
There is a unanimous committee behind these fifteen amendments .
The Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party supports this recommendation for second reading from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
We currently have an experiment as far as Finnish legislation is concerned , but what does the Commissioner think of the possibilities of getting information about the situation in all Member States through the same service ?
My question about the Schengen Information System concerns the supervisory function of the JSA , the Joint Supervisory Authority .
The JSA also emphasizes that it has totally inadequate resources to carry out the investigation it wants , including budgetary resources and resources for translation .
It is important to stimulate technical development towards more advanced exhaust gas purification technology and towards more fuel-efficient engines by guaranteeing access to fuel with a very low sulphur content until the year 2005 .
On this point I think the Council has a more realistic approach .
It is also important for Member States to be allowed to take a lead and to have the right to use economic means of control to improve the environment .
Finally , it is pleasing to note that the development towards cars with zero emissions is moving so quickly .
In the common position irradiation is accepted as a possible method of preserving foodstuffs .
I think that is important and would appeal to the Members of this House to support the amendments from the Committee on the Environment .
It should therefore not be allowed to happen .
In itself , what has been said here may be true , that it does not present any risk to human health .
Food can look as if it is quite fresh , even though underneath it is old and quite bad .
I see it as two steps : first and foremost that we support the Committee on the Environment ; but the same time it would make sense to go a step further and support the amendments which have been presented to the parliamentary debate by the Green Group .
The best thing in this situation would be if we could decide on a ban on the irradiation of foodstuffs with the exception of herbs and spices , but we do not have that option here .
Under current Swedish rules , irradiation is banned except for certain herbs and spices .
If Parliament does not follow Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz ' amendments , Sweden will be forced to weaken its legislation .
Mr President , during the Gulf War in 1991 , the USA and its allies dropped 277 000 tonnes of bombs over Iraq in 42 days .
On the other hand , according to UNICEF , these measures have led to 4 500 children under the age of five dying each month .
Now the USA wants to hide its President 's domestic problems through a new bombing war against Iraq , a war which is going to increase the suffering of the civilian population without solving the problem of weapons of mass destruction , and without paying any regard to the UN , which the USA systematically sabotages .
They should be out of all other countries too .
How stubbornly have they demanded an effective EU alternative ?
But now , when the moment of truth has come , when the American master whistles , Green and Brok , Bertens and the others obediently wag their tales .
The EU could have played an important , strategic role for peace .
The stale religious prejudices against Islam reach out and transform the EU 's powerful elite into obedient slaves on the American triumphal chariot .
It is tragic , it is deplorable , it is shameful .
That also applies to the international community .
Therefore , it is important that no green light be given for any military bombing by the USA .
The answer is certainly no .
It is excellent that all five permanent members of the Security Council support Kofi Annan 's journey to Iraq and diplomatic solutions .
It is clear that we should not break off relations .
It is true that things have happened in China .
But is that really enough to give China approval ?
Human Rights Watch does not think so .
I would like to ask this : is it really the case that the Council has a strategy for human rights in China ?
We are not alone in our criticism .
Political meetings are banned and there are continued attacks on ethnic minorities .
But multinational oil companies , including European ones such as Total , continue to support the military regime .
But Parliament now demands that the Council respond to Aung San Suu Kyi 's call for economic sanctions against the military junta by breaking off all trading and tourist links between the EU and Burma , and by stopping investment in Burma by European companies .
I wonder whether this really is a job for the EU.
In the EU there would be different rules to those we
