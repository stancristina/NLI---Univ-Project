The United States , through the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation , has been the guarantor of Europe 's security and , for the time being , there is still no alternative to this link .
Why was the Committee on Constitutional Affairs concerned with this subject , Mr President ?
Mr Vondra , this House wishes to cooperate with the Council and we laid down the criteria that the headquarters of this new Union for the Mediterranean needed to meet .
I would like to follow on from my colleague Mr Méndez de Vigo , who always quotes great literary figures , by recalling a phrase from Shakespeare 's King Lear , in which it is said that ' The worst is not , so long as we can say , " This is the worst ” ' .
In this way , we will be able to build a Mediterranean of peace , solidarity and also an alliance of civilisations .
The results have been much more modest , especially in the fields of human rights , democracy and the environment .
The second reason why I have recommended that we do not vote in favour is because with regard to the free trade area , regional differences are not taken into account .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would first of all like to point out that unanimity was achieved in the ITRE Committee regarding this report .
In fact , from the beginning , we considered the development of European research infrastructures to be one of the pillars of the European Research Area .
We therefore want to send a clear message to the Council to resolve its problems on this issue as soon as possible and to say once again that if we want to promote research in Europe , we must release it from tax burdens .
What we need to do now is implement this roadmap .
Fisheries research is also vital when drawing up recommendations and providing scientific advice to legislators .
Currently it is the Research Directorate-General that is responsible , and the result is that it is becoming difficult for the scientific community to communicate the concerns and needs of the sector to those that draw up the guidelines for the calls for proposals .
To be brief , what we are doing is simply responding to a report by the Commission , which is a report on the application of Council Regulation (EC ) No 1206/2001 of 28 May 2001 on cooperation between the courts of the Member States in the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters .
For example , what could the Commission do to equip courts , particularly those at a lower level , with technological facilities such as videoconferencing systems ?
It cannot be argued that the judges , as well as having to be experts in their own law , which is fairly complex in itself , should be obliged to have knowledge of this kind .
In the report , we in the Committee on Petitions express our concern at the fact that , where infringement proceedings are brought against a Member State as a result of a petition by citizens , the Member State has the right to deny access to the public documents used in those infringement proceedings , thereby shutting the door on citizens ' participation .
We are now writing a new chapter in the history of Europe , by making it an area of greater safety on our seas .
Lastly , but no less importantly for all that , I would like to highlight this Chamber 's steadfastness in upholding Europe 's interests and protecting the citizens whom we represent .
Only once a detailed assessment of all the risks has been carried out will the authority finally decide whether to admit the vessel or to send it away .
This change has enabled us to reach a solution , albeit a minimal one .
I was in my office listening to Vice-President Tajani and the other speakers , and I feel I have to congratulate all the rapporteurs and the Commission .
If the codecision procedure is ever justified , I think it is in the case of this package and the way it has been handled .
That is because we have had to balance many different things here in this package : classification societies have had to be brought together with marine equipment ; all interests have had to be put clearly on the table ; and , above all , Parliament has had to show leadership .
That has brought us to this situation , in which there is hardly any way out .
We would like to help achieve an effective political agreement within the Council on this subject which , in our view , is extremely important and deserves our closest attention .
Adding to the almost non-existent governance to counter the concurrent interests of fishing nations and high market demand , numerous factors of various kinds combine to leave the bluefin , a highly exploited species nowadays , in such a precarious situation .
I am not talking about a decade here , but five years at most .
With regard to the European Investment Bank , we are fully in agreement with having recourse to it , but we should say that we are worried we are entrusting it with many commitments without having a guarantee that they can be taken forward .
At the Expo , over 2 000 experts , in the Water Tribune , and NGOs , in the forum named the Agora , as well as the delegations from the Commission and Parliament , debated and generated an enormous volume of debate and very interesting , creative proposals on water management .
Despite the economic boom of recent years , however , this is not the best time for Latin America in terms of its integration .
