The Council has not made any cuts to commitment appropriations , and indeed it cannot do so , as everything in this area has been laid down , on the one hand by Agenda 2000 and on the other by the accession treaties .
Thirdly , it is in any case impossible to simply compare tax rates without taking into account the width of the tax base used in calculations .
This still has to be negotiated , but in recent years it has been possible to achieve compromise , and this will also be the case for next year .
Matters relating to agricultural policy have been touched upon , and the agricultural reform we have drawn up will be implemented as of 1 January 2005 .
I only wish to say a few words on the issue of information policy ; here , too , we will have serious things to say to the Commission , as it has refused to make the outcome of the Convention known to the general public .
Who exactly should pursue truly ecological policies in Europe , if not us ?
It follows that further intensive debate on this issue with the Council is needed , as there is absolutely no point in putting too little money in the Budget and having to submit a supplementary Budget later on .
The European market is being opened up and trade barriers mean that many markets are not accessible to our exporters .
It is actually an unwritten , but self-evident law of humanity that says that children are not to be targeted by such actions .
To be consistent , though , we then have to say that such crises are no better dealt with by nullifying the democratic system , by abolishing the rule of law , or by reintroducing authoritarian structures .
We are left with the lie of an unwinnable war .
My second point is that , if you analyse what is going on there now , we have every reason to criticise Putin’s policy on Chechnya in recent years , but the underlying character of this attack has nothing to do with Chechnya .
Despite all our differences , we must , I believe , try to join together in establishing political responsibility .
On the assumption that the interpreter got it right , Mr Bot said that ‘the occupation was brought to an end’ , which is obviously nonsense .
It is to prevent this that the Maastricht mechanism , the Stability Pact and the relevant regulations are there , and they have been breached in the past .
Commissioner Almunia’s reference to demographic development shows that we must acknowledge and take into consideration the developments of which we were as yet unaware when we first debated the Stability Pact .
In policy terms , Germany and France have got their way , at least for the time being .
After all , there are now six European countries which have been so successful in cutting back that they are now experiencing a crisis , and it is as a result of this , rather than of expansionist spending policies , that they are no longer in a position to comply with the ‘stability ’ criteria .
We need clear rules that apply to everyone and successful implementation .
If you tell governments that they must make savings and reduce debt when better times arrive , I do not believe that they will suddenly do so merely because the Commission tells them to , but because they want to make good on their election promises when the income situation improves .
Where have you found even one piece of economic evidence to support such a statement ?
An overall compromise has been reached , and we must see the wood and not just the trees , to put it metaphorically .
There were two Commissioners responsible for the Constitution in the outgoing Commission , yet there is no longer even one at this decisive stage of the debate on it .
The aim would be to set an example for peace and stability in our continent and for greater integration , and this would be a viable way of doing so .     Mr President , a few days ago the Committee on Constitutional Affairs discussed the allocation of large amounts of EU money to institutions whose job it is to inform the European public about the Constitutional Treaty .
Ever since the end of August , the Portuguese Government has been preventing the Dutch vessel from entering a port on the west coast of Portugal .
That is something we want to prevent , and that is why we are having this debate today .
Portuguese men and women are extremely well informed and have access to every possible source of information .
Yesterday , we also started considering the issue of African lions .
It will also be necessary to take into account the extremely grave economic damage already sustained by European airlines as a consequence of the events of ‘9/11’ and the drastic rise in the price of oil .
It was not only Poles , Ruthenes , Germans , Hungarians , and Czechs , but also Croats and Slovenes , who established themselves there a long time ago and have co-existed well with each other .
So I would have liked today , to see both the Commission , and also the Council , fully represented .
All in all , though , I would like us to take our leave of each other on a positive note .
Your campaign , and that by your Commissioners , for the Constitution – a campaign that is still going on , for it may be signed in Rome on 29 October , but this will not mean that it has been ratified – this campaign was a cause you
