still refuse to co-operate .
It is two years now since the violent Israeli-Palestinian conflict broke out again .
The EU 's response is that this progress should be utilised for the resumption of political negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians which are able to give both parties concrete prospects of a peaceful solution to the conflict .
At the informal meeting of Foreign Ministers in Elsinore on 30-31 August of this year , the EU completed its proposal for a timetable pointing the way towards peace and towards the establishment of a Palestinian state by the summer of 2005 .
Firstly , entry this year into an Israeli-Palestinian security agreement that will stop the violence and pave the way for the Palestinian presidential and parliamentary elections that are expected to be held on 20 January 2003 .
Following these elections , negotiations are to be started on the establishment of a Palestinian state with temporary borders , and this is to take place in the autumn of 2003 .
We will then enter the third phase , in which a final peace agreement is to be entered into , adopting positions on the difficult issues of Jerusalem , borders , refugees and settlers which must be solved before the final establishment of a Palestinian state in mid-2005 .
During my trip to the Middle East in early September , the proposal was generally well received by the parties in the region .
The proposal was also welcomed by the Israeli side , although Israel expressed a number of reservations as regards certain elements of the proposal .
There was also support for the EU 's suggestion of holding an international donor conference on support for the Palestinian reform process by the end of the year .
The EU and the Presidency are working in accordance with the declaration made by the Seville European Council on the holding of an early peace conference which will be able to discuss and reach agreement on a timetable for the road ahead towards lasting peace in the Middle East .
The members of the Middle East Quartet have agreed to continue discussions on the date and modalities of such an international peace conference .
The Danish Presidency intends to continue this policy and to work actively towards a detailed timetable which can pave the way for a peaceful solution to one of the most enduring conflicts in recent history .
I also note that yesterday 's security resolution specifically mentions the necessity of the EU 's and the Quartet 's peace plan , or timetable , moving forward despite what happened last week .
What happened - as all of you here know - is that there were two suicide attacks in Israel .
Now we have had these serious setbacks .
However , last week 's actions show that militant groups such as Islamic Jihad have no intention of complying with Fatah and Tanzim 's moratorium .
Israel has the right to fight terrorism , but the fierce Israeli retaliation - including the siege and bombardment of President Arafat 's headquarters in Ramallah - will not bring peace and security to the Israeli and Palestinian people .
It is crucial that the heralded American/Jordanian/Egyptian support of Palestinian police and security forces is put into effect very quickly so that there is a unified security system on the Palestinian side with which Israel feels reasonably secure .
Radical groups also threaten peace in the relationship between India and Pakistan , which remains tense .
Local elections are currently being held in Jammu and Kashmir .
The run-up to the elections has been violent and has given cause for concern .
However , it is our hope that the elections in Jammu and Kashmir will be able to pave the way for a resumption of the dialogue between India and Pakistan on a long-term solution .
I now turn to Europe and to our nearest neighbour , Russia .
The lead-up to the summit between the EU and Russia , which will take place in Copenhagen on 11 November 2002 , will provide us with an opportunity to take stock of five years of partnership and cooperation .
We all know that .
On 30 September the Council will discuss the investigation of this issue carried out by the Commission in order , in consultation with Poland and Lithuania , to find a solution complying with current Community law .
The purpose of such a strategy will be to encourage democratic and economic reforms in the neighbouring countries and to strengthen cross-border cooperation with these countries .
A communication that the Commission will present in the course of the autumn will naturally supplement these deliberations and hopefully lead to a decision in December .
Now I will move away from Europe and move down to Africa .
As you all know , critical conditions prevail in southern Africa , where the EU is concerned at the worsening of the situation in Zimbabwe - including the latest attacks on the media , the continuing spiteful actions against farmers and President Mugabe 's appointment of a new hard-line government which is being called a 'war cabinet ' .
At the same time , the EU decided to continue cooperating with other international parties with a view to finding a solution in Zimbabwe .
The EU will , however , continue to support Zimbabwe 's population - which is suffering from the consequences of Mugabe 's policies - by sending massive quantities of food aid which will ease the famine in the country and by offering social and medical assistance .
The Community and its Member States have already responded by offering the region food and humanitarian aid to a value of EUR 490 million .
A number of political decisions and measures taken by the governments in the region , particularly that of Zimbabwe , have further contributed to worsening the already alarming humanitarian situation .
