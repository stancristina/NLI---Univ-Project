details , which are particularly complicated and particularly difficult .
What we can do is to call for there to be now a serious and reliable guarantee from the UN and from the European Union that the entire Annan plan , as it stands , will be applied to the end and there will be no tricks and circumventions after one year or after eight months or two years .
Nonetheless , the question is : how can we help the yes vote , how can we try to bring about a yes vote in the referendum ?
Similarly , maintaining Cyprus , a Member State of the European Union , under a regime of guarantees by third countries , one of which is not even a member of the Union , goes against the principles of the European Union and weakens the development of the European security and defence policy , quite apart from the fact that the permanent presence of Greek and Turkish troops on the island goes against the principle of demilitarisation which is established in the plan .
Only thus can we convince of the importance of the yes vote , based henceforth on the European perspective .
When I was young , I suffered in my own country from the suppression of the freedom of the press and I feel pain and shame that today Greeks seeking their freedom are depriving Commissioner Verheugen of the right to address them and try to persuade them of what he considers to be right , he who fought so hard for things to reach a satisfactory situation .
The Cypriots divided because they were divided by a now bankrupt colonial regime , because they were divided by the cold war .
The greatest guarantee is within and they must bring it forth from within themselves .
They believed that the much vaunted acquis communautairewould result in the resolution of the problem .
What is the Commissioner afraid of ?
The obligations which derive from the fact that one part of a Member State of the European Union will be under the occupation of a candidate country ?
What sort of state is it that will operate as an umbrella for two practically independent states , which will even be able to send representatives to European Councils and diplomatic missions , two states which will need special agreements in order to regulate their relations , while being at the mercy of the guarantor powers and foreign courts ?
Leave at long last the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots to assess the situation , to take a decision on the basis of their own interests .
Today 's debate confirms the vital role of the European Parliament in this entire lengthy development of hope on the Cypriot question and the exceptionally positive role of Commissioner Verheugen , of Mr Poos , and of all sides of the European Union in general .
We must all respond to the challenges of history , by looking the dilemma straight in the eye and responding responsibly and positively .
The European Parliament and the European Union give both their support and their capabilities as security guarantees of the full exploitation of all aspects of the Annan plan .
I should like to finish with an ancient Greek motto : time waits for no man .     – Mr President , I wish I could also say Commissioner but Mr Verheugen has left us very early and I am sorry about that , nearly all the political parties in Greece and the most important parties in Cyprus have come out in favour of the Annan plan .
They could not .
It was they who caused most of the disasters in Cyprus .
That is why , in addition to security guarantees , the prospect of a second referendum must be left open after the referendum in three days ' time , which looks like being a no vote .
It does not put both sides on an equal footing and it makes provision for painfully long transitional periods for transposing the acquis communautaire .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is a fact that we are at the moment holding a general political debate on the prevailing climate in the run up to the referendum on Saturday rather than on the content of the Annan plan , because a debate on the content of this plan , despite the fact that its positive points far outnumber its negative points , could turn into a detailed debate lasting several hours .
The resolution adopted is an insult of the first magnitude to the Cypriot people , in that it calls on them 'to be fully responsible , consistent and committed to their status as EU citizens ' .
Equally repulsive of the content of the resolution were the positions of numerous 'friends ' of Cyprus , including President Pat Cox , Commissioners Verheugen and Patten and Greek MEPs .
The President accused the Cypriot media of exclusion at a time when he himself , in an interview with a Cypriot newspaper , talked at leisure about the Cypriot leadership 's lack of courage and imagination .
The Commissioner exceeded the remit granted to him by his institutional role and the need to respect the democratic rights of which the Commission is supposedly the guardian .
The resolution , instead of adopting a pressure line , should have clearly emphasised respect for whatever choice the Cypriots make and accepted the constructive amendments proposed by the GUE/NGL and the Coalition MEP Μr Papayannakis on securing clear undertakings and guarantees .
Basically there are two states , with separate economies , trade , industry , agricultural policy and employment policy .
We consider the statements made today by Mr Verheugen and others and threats of the 'end of the world ' if they do not accept the Annan plan to be unacceptable
