Having been at first a rather euphoric European , and having now become , after fifteen years in the European Parliament , a more realistic , more critical , not to say more uneasy one , I wanted to use my two minutes to shout , ‘Look out !
Above all , as this House had said , the Intergovernmental Conference is a thing of the past .
Although the Spring European Council is certainly not the culmination of European history , it could well be a key staging post on the way to the speedy adoption of a Constitution and as we progress towards putting in place the economic and trading frameworks that are indispensable if Europe is , at last , to enjoy growth .     . – This proposal strikes us as being worthy of condemnation in various respects , not only the damage it does to subsidiarity and its failure to respect the Member States’ competence in the educational sphere .
Given the choice between the total and partial decoupling of aid , we would prefer aid to be partially decoupled ; were we to be asked to choose between this reform being implemented at once or deferring it , we would prefer a further short respite .
It is fortunate that the UN plan includes two compensatory mechanisms .
I cannot see , therefore , how I can share in the rapporteur’s conclusions ; rather , I am concerned about them .
The impression given by Baroness Nicholson’s report on Romania is different ; in fact the contrast is striking .
The first comment concerns the motorways of the sea , on which I take the opposite position to Mr Bradbourn and Mr Jarzembowski .
This can only cause ill-feeling and disputes .
Normally , Mr President , people eat wherever they happen to get hungry .
I think that there is already an internal market for postal services , except for private use .
As has just been pointed out , the purpose of the amendments proposed to us is , on the one hand , to incorporate into the document changes that have appeared in the various social security schemes and , on the other hand , to perform the essential task of incorporating the decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Communities when the latter has had to give a ruling upon these topics .
Finally , the proposal is a factor that facilitates and promotes the advances expected in the current general overhaul of Regulation No 1408/71 .
I understand the position of our Dutch fellow MEPs where a number of the benefits are concerned .
Finally , I am , like the members of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , hostile to any further privatisation of health care .
We are therefore in favour of rejecting the Commission ’s proposal but , contrary to the rapporteur , we are still not registering our support for the internal European market in the postal sector .     I voted in favour of this agreement , as I did in favour of the previous one .
We , on the contrary , call upon the Council to curb these proposals and to reject them whenever they are lax .
There is no reason for giving such pledges in advance to Turkey .     .
I also expected France to be congratulated on having implemented a measure for preventive diplomacy , a measure to which the European Union , if it had been a good sport , would have been able to lend its support .
Thirdly , the EU has taken the first steps towards a common defence policy and also a common arms industry .
It is imperative that the European Union remains vigilant , as regards the places of detention , and that it should also be present at the next elections .
This resolution calls for the tightening of sanctions and restrictions targeted against this regime , as well as the immediate release of political prisoners , starting with our Sakharov prize-winner Aung San Suu Kyi .
The Council and the Commissioner have , however , ensured a degree of balance and have not exempted companies from the transparency obligations .
When the European institutions gave full power to the International Account Standards board and gave a commitment to apply these rules as of 2005 , I think that they made a very serious mistake .
As you know , Luxembourg , the United Kingdom , Ireland , Sweden and Finland rejected this common position .
It must rather be an investment for the future so that the people and the countries targeted will one day become partners and can promote their own development .
We need something tangible ; we need actions and not just talk and fine words .
Indeed , non-discrimination between persons is one of the common principles of the EU and its Member States .
Equality in the access to and supply of goods and services is essential .
In politics , however , nobody is forced to do what is impossible or absurd .
It could be that nobody is interested in this issue ; it could also be that this is simply an extremely tricky one .
He is doubtlessly aware that there is an ‘insurance ’ directive , specifically devoted to insurance , and that Article 18 of this directive requires that insurers calculate sufficiently prudent premiums taking account of future commitments .
We should , however , have the political courage to know exactly what we are talking about when we talk about poverty .
The continued difficulties with Switzerland , despite the conclusion of the agreement that is being submitted to us here , and the difficult pursuit of negotiations with the other third countries , back me up in this assessment and in my vote today
