wellbeing of workers and their extended families , the European Parliament as the institution representing the people of Europe , absolutely must adopt a strong stance on a global strategy to promote employment and its corresponding social policy in the European Union .
The problem lies in what rigidity we are talking about .
Hence our vote against the report .
Lastly , because I do not share the unreserved devotion to the politically federalist and boundlessly liberal vision of the European Union which underlies the rapporteur 's analysis , I decided to abstain from the final overall vote .
.
( Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137( 1 ) of the Rules of Procedure )
I have consequently voted in favour of this report .
I agree with all the speakers who have emphasised that something is wrong in the relationship between the Commission and Parliament .
Guarantees must be provided for a definition of the reasons , for restrictions on the use of these data , for the conditions and restrictions on forwarding and sharing data , for protecting data from unauthorised access , for the duration and conditions of storage , for national measures for the protection of sensitive data , for passengers ' means of recourse to review and correct data kept by the US authorities and , finally , for conditions of reciprocity .
As Mr Pirker and Mrs Terrón i Cusí have said , in waging the fight against crime , the rule of law must be upheld and citizens ' rights must not be called into question .
We naturally attempt to receive answers here in plenary and we fail to understand what criterion is used .
I believe that we need to draft a law similar to the US Oil Pollution Act , so that , through this European initiative , we can modify the legislation of the International Maritime Organisation .
What we must do now , however , is seek an appropriate strategy with which to do this .
We must bear in mind that there have been no accidents in the United States in the last fifteen years , but there have been in Galicia and in Brittany .
Given that Parliament is the institution closest to the citizens and that its commitment to protecting equal opportunities has enabled many policies in this field to be developed , it is its duty to set an example by increasing the integration of women into parliamentary activities and into the institution 's internal structures .
I do not think , however , that systematically implementing the principle of preference for women candidates for positions of leadership is a suitable alternative , as long as this imbalance persists .
This is just to mention a few of the shortcomings and to show that the Commission must act to remedy them .
It is reasonable to give the responsible authorities the right to reject proposals or to propose their revision and to apply penalties in the event that projects do not comply with the requirements to integrate equal opportunities .
Even with the existence of a regulation dating back to 1999 , which sets equality of opportunity as a key objective of actions under the Structural Funds , it is nevertheless true that , with the exception of the European Social Fund , this concept has still not been incorporated by the administrations , either of the fifteen countries of the Union or of the ten enlargement countries .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , terrorism constitutes a threat to stability , freedom and democracy .
As I said earlier with regard to the issue of the transmission of personal data by airlines on flights to and from the United States , combating crime must be done in full compliance with the rule of law and not call citizens ' rights into question .
This is a timely initiative , which clearly alerts us to a fact that some people appear not to want to understand : the fact that any fight that forgets these priorities will ultimately constitute an unjustified acceptance of barbarity and a step backwards in terms of civilisation , which we find unacceptable .
This is how we have reached a situation in which OLAF 's investigations into contracts between the Commission and the company Eurogramme , which began as long ago as 1999 , are completely ignored by the Luxembourg judicial authorities , and also by the Commission , whose Secretary-General decided to close the case with one blow of the gavel , without even informing the Commissioner responsible of the existence of this trial and allowing dozens of contracts to be signed in the meantime between this company and the Commission .
Secrecy must only be invoked when it is crucial to protecting the good name and the reputation of the person accused or to the successful outcome of the investigation .
This is all we are calling for .
This success is also the result of these rules being communitarised .
.
( PT ) I agree with the content of this report because , in my view , equality between men and women requires equality of access to the benefits of the Structural Funds .
In this context , however , I think it is appropriate and crucial to protect and also deal appropriately with the high value of domestic and intra-family work .
Hence our appeal to the Portuguese Government not to accept this position and to take account of the European Parliament Resolution rejecting the ECB 's recommendation .
First of all , because it eliminates the principle currently in force , which is 'one State , one vote ' .
In practice , this reform runs the risk of marginalising the smaller Member States , abusing the principle of 'one country , one vote ' and making the ECB 's operations complex and opaque .
