needed on the solution to issues surrounding both legal and illegal migration .
It concerns loaves of bread in the United Kingdom .
This should be ensured for a transitional period by Euro 5 , but should ultimately be provided for in the type-approval framework directive .
Daphne is Europe 's way of showing just how much importance it attaches to combating violence against women , and , as a programme , must be a constant reminder and encouragement to us to put the campaign against that violence - directed not only against women but also against children - centre stage .
What has to be avoided is the occurrence of a sort of 'displacement effect' , with a move away from the combating of poverty and from the millennium goals campaign towards promoting an orientation towards exports .
So it was that they , reluctantly , agreed to our demand for a convention , knowing as they did that what the 15 had hammered out would not be enough for 27 .
If Europe wants to remain as successful as it is , it must change the treaties that underpin it , and if you fight like a leopard , then you will find us fighting alongside you .
I would like , Prime Minister , to refer to two of the observations you made , and which I see as the most important things you said in your speech .
( DE ) What is crucial is not what he is called , but rather what he is meant to do .
Since it is the International Whaling Commission that is primarily responsible for whale issues , no new resolutions should be framed in the course of our negotiations that would alter the current preservation status of whales under the Convention , and it follows that a review of whale stocks with a view to the possible downgrading of their preservation status under CITES should be considered only after mechanisms for checks on their management have been introduced and considered suitable by the International Whaling Commission .
I would refer the honourable Member to the explanations given to him in response to an oral question in the April question session , and would like to reiterate that the Presidency attaches great importance to the constant improvement of integrated border control at the external borders of the European Union and , in particular , to the reinforcement of the maritime external borders to the south .
We can agree , then , that it is the Member States that are responsible for the defence of the external borders , while Frontex can be called on to act in a supporting role by - for example - monitoring a stretch of the sea or of a land frontier .
The fact is that so much information has been made available that the waste that has to be collected - ranging from lighters to bottles larger than 100 ml - would not be there in the first place , if people had given the matter a little thought before embarking on a flight .
The Council regularly brings this concern to Russia 's attention in the course of the EU/Russia dialogue , to which I have just made reference in another instance , and various levels have been established at which concerns may be raised with the Russians , not only in policy dialogue at summits and ministerial meetings , but also at the human rights consultations which were introduced in March 2005 under the presidency of Luxembourg and now take place twice a year .
I do believe that it is right in principle that we have named October 2007 as the target date for reviewing whether the present protection , as it is laid down , is still appropriate in terms of time or whether there has to be a response on the part of the European Union .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to start by expressing my sincere thanks to our rapporteur Mr Busk for the truly constructive , collegial and - in my opinion - very good work he has done in cooperation with the other members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
Naturally , peace thrives best where democracy prevails .
I do think , however , that we have some way to go in today 's vote before we have a report that - without also attracting censure from India , Pakistan or anyone else - ultimately serves our common aim of helping Kashmir to finally become a region characterised by peace , prosperity , and respect for the environment and human rights .
At the previous sessions of the Human Rights Council , the European Union has also attached importance to substantive debates on human-rights issues as well as to dialogue and close cooperation .
The planned code of conduct for special rapporteurs must not impair their independence ; on the contrary , it must guarantee that independence and focus on the obligations of the states with which the rapporteurs cooperate .
The old behaviour patterns resurfaced .
All we can say so far is that there have been bright and dark sides .
The support we receive usually comes from Canada , Switzerland , Norway , the countries applying for EU membership and individual countries covered by our neighbourhood policy , to name a few of the main sources .
