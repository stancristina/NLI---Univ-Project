the resolution of the Liberal Group I should say that it contains a number of points which reflect the views of our Group too .
We would stress that .
This seems to me a good thing .
The main problem is not his wish to strengthen the power of the president by means of constitutional change to be put to the people in a referendum .
At the same time it has to be made clear to Belarus that the constitutional developments there are causing concern and that its ties with the European Union can only be expended if the fundamental principles of democracy and the rule of law are upheld .
And that was quite properly the thrust of what Commissioner van den Broek told the foreign minister of Belarus when they met on the occasion of the recent General Assembly of the United Nations .
Two weeks ago a strategy conference was held in Ottawa at the instigation and invitation of the Canadian Government .
( NL ) Ladies and gentlemen , if this can be done it may save hundreds or even thousands of lives .
Secondly , the terrible events in Belgium have caused attention to be focused currently on sex tourism .
We managed this morning to retain the budget line for tourism , but it was not easy .
Mr President , the three reports on tourism once again force us to ask what place tourism should occupy within the common policies of the Union .
For the sake of clarity I would stress that I am every bit as convinced as the rapporteurs of the great social and economic significance of tourism , particularly for jobs .
Healthy competition is both desirable and necessary here .
But it is obvious that the railways will have to be geared far better to the needs of the market if they are not to continue losing market share .
After earlier reticence because of the American presidential elections the Commission decided in favour of a tough political response to the trade measures taken by the United States against Cuba .
The question for us is thus whether there is a sufficient basis for community action under Articles 113 and 235 of the Treaty .
Fishery Mr President , I have a point of order under Rule 109( 3 ) .
Having said that , I should like to take this opportunity to make two basic points about the plight of refugees in general , especially since the rapporteur felt obliged in his explanatory statement , quite unnecessarily , to criticize the European Union for its 'racism ' and 'xenophobia ' .
Let us hope that the Council will now adopt Parliament 's recommendations at second reading and actually do something to promote sustainable development , instead of merely paying it lip-service .
As if environment costs did not hit us just as hard as energy costs !
Alternative sources of energy are required .
The answer to this will very much influence how we deal with the McNally report .
The Court of Auditors ' report says - though 1995 was an exception - that revenue will increasingly have to be based on estimates of gross national product .
Public service broadcasting must be protected , but this need not imply that commercial broadcasting cannot also develop .
Official rules on the protection of minors must not impinge on freedom of expression or the fundamental right to privacy , which is another reason to regard broadcasting as a separate concept from the new media .
A distinction thus needs to be made between broadcasts for the public and programmes for the individual .
Europe 's industry needs a free internal market and help in financing films , for example , which the guarantee fund can supply .
This should certainly be maintained , but there should not be any other exceptions , and so we reject the socialist amendments designed to create stricter rules on tobacco , alcohol and children 's advertising .
We are concerned about the substance of the directive , about jobs and about choice , and on these points , coincidentally , the Council and the Commission have got it right .
MEDIA II is being cut from ECU 400 million a year to ECU 310 m .
Parents have a vital role to play here .
Mr President , I actually wanted to talk about the Wijsenbeek amendment on the two-thirds rule , which the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights has taken over .
Mr President , in the short time which is available to me , I should like to look at the Kuckelkorn report .
In the short term , I hope that the project will enjoy the same success as the Beethoven composition of the same name .
I would be prepared to agree with this if the ELISE programme were the only one of its type , but it is not .
Major concentrations of power and distortions caused by state aid are undermining the single market , and the Commission has a very clear role to play here .
If the programme fails because of bureaucratic nonsense like this , then the Council will have all the more reason to oppose similar projects next year .
Firstly , subjecting firms to too many rules and regulations is not the right way to set about things .
I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur , Mrs Garc√≠a Arias , though I have to say that I cannot agree with everything which her report contains .
I think the House needs to take a very clear view of this .
Mr President , on a point of order .
I think there are two important points here .
I am sorry , but I do not have the figures to hand to be able to give you an answer .
