I am grateful to Mr Henderson for giving such a clear answer today .
In that case , I would like to repeat the last part of my question : ' What means would it propose to achieve this improved environmental quality , in light of the existing fundamental lack of capacity within the Commission ? '
But I do not think that I was given any actual indication at all of how to remedy the situation , given the Commission 's lack of capacity at present .
In a nutshell , how can we ensure that priority will be given to integrating the environment in implementing the EU 's overseas aid programmes and , in view of this , will there be incentives which will be sufficiently effective to ensure that integration also takes place in practice ?
The report looks at all the main problems involved in deregulation .
We have noticed this , it is happening in a whole host of sectors .
How can deregulation and improving services best be carried out without affecting jobs and employee security and without reducing the availability of public services , including transport ?
This is highlighted in points 1 and 6 of the report .
I understand that the investigations mentioned in the report are now under way .
It is essential that this new situation be dealt with in a sensible fashion .
Mr President , something must be wrong in Europe if I can learn from the press that SAS cabin staff are thinking of setting up a strike fund in Panama .
We can only shake our heads at this ; I do not understand why this is happening .
If we take a closer look at the competitive situation in Europe , a multi-coloured picture emerges , even though deregulation is taking place .
On others , it is the opposite .
There is no overall picture at present of how deregulation is progressing .
It takes an experienced traveller to find their way around the jungle of what is available .
But it should be the other way round .
Perhaps that is why prices per km are higher than in the USA .
If it is really true that flying costs 40 % more in Europe than in the USA , it is time the politicians did something .
Why is it more expensive ?
Is it a lack of air traffic control ?
Or is it due to search for profits ?
It is quite profitable to run an airline in Europe .
Imagine if one day we could fly at a set price per kilometer .
I certainly think that would be fair .
There are not many markets where acquiring market share is such a capital-intensive business as it is in aviation .
But , in many cases - even if the new companies are not around for long - this is enough to worry the established ones .
Even if only a few of them survive , they are proof that the market is not completely closed .
Price agreements and alliances are very serious phenomena which need monitoring .
I will be the rapporteur for the report on this : so it is important to us how the market develops in this area in future .
But is it not precisely in the case of the major airports that the problem arises ?
I look forward to seeing the Commission 's proposals , and I , for my part , will do my best .
It was not until the Great Belt tunnel was opened , as the Commissioner knows , and railway transport in Denmark became effective that the airlines reduced their fares .
Commissioner , rapporteur , we will consider developments and deregulation ; together with the Commission , we have an important job to ensure good flights for passengers and proper conditions for staff .
Madam President , let me first of all make it clear that I am not at all enthusiastic about this proposed directive , neither as presented by the Commission nor with the proposed modifications of the Environment Committee .
It is worrying when even someone who is not a lawyer is able to find several unclear formulations and other problems in the text .
Moreover , these proposals for a directive appear excessively intrusive as touching the Sale of Goods Act , which , indeed , lies at the heart of transactions .
Incidentally , the proposed directive does not solve the problems the consumer experiences with cross-border transactions .
Therefore , it could be asked whether harmonization serves any purpose whatsoever and whether it will have any effect on this area .
Here and now I can only point out one single specific problem of the policy document , that is , the rights of the consumer in the case of defects or deficiencies .
It would be horrendously expensive if a large number of consumers required agreements to be waived when not strictly necessary .
And at the end of the day , these costs will have to be borne by the consumer .
Moreover , this is also completely untenable from an environmental point of view .
We are really talking about a right to repair and replace for the seller without taking into consideration whether this is a great inconvenience to the consumer .
Therefore , this motion should be rejected in order to allow us to achieve a reasonable sharing of the burden between consumer and seller .
Mr President , there is no doubt that it is sensible for us to make an effort to handle this matter at the European level .
The number of people being killed on the roads has been mentioned several times today .
May I point out that 45 000 people die on the roads each year , the equivalent of the Estonia
