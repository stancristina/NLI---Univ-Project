So what we need are ambitious targets which will be binding on the whole of Europe , in the interests of the car industry and the consumer .
And we need this for both petrol and diesel engines .
I believe that , overall , there is nothing immoral about the proposal I am making to the Commission and the Council .
Has any thought been given to how this can be prevented , so that these workers remain in their own countries and have opportunities for employment there ?
But it would have provided an opportunity to make provision , at this stage , for a possible future revision which is not yet seen as a matter of urgency .
When further measures are proposed , we constantly hear the argument - we have heard it several times here today - that costs increase as a result .
The reason , of course , is that we never have the courage to put forward figures that will do duty for the future , but always mess about with tiny percentages .
Let me also say a word about the so-called on-board diagnosis system .
Then I could quite well image such things .
Madam President , Commissioner , a directive on the burden of proof in cases of discrimination based on sex is greatly welcomed by many women 's associations and individuals , and has been long awaited .
In my work as a personnel consultant I very often came up against these problems , whether in connection with appointments or promotions or pay , and so I know better than most how difficult it is for the women concerned to prove their point - I know that they were unable to succeed in their claims because they were women .
Problems still remain .
The European Investment Fund , in fact , allows financial institutions to subscribe to 30 % of its capital .
However , the difficulties already experienced by the Council in formulating its position are bad omens .
Nothing will happen , even if the fishing season is about to start .
The Council , however , is entitled at any time to limit the permissible fishing effort for any fishery if the condition of stocks so dictates .
On the issue as a whole , I must add that the Commission is seeking a fleet limitation , but we in the PPE Group feel that this is misplaced .
I do not know whether that message came across .
We hoped that a solution would develop which would reflect the situation before the referendum .
That is why I believe we must not miss the opportunity to invite these parliamentarians here .
And however much Boris Yeltsin , to whom I might still ascribe a degree of goodwill , might squirm in this situation , we must not forget that in today 's Duma exactly the same combination of forces exists as in the German Reichstag of that time .
I therefore ask the House to do everything in its power to exert pressure on Belarus , and on Russia too , so that the situation there can at least be brought partly under control .
Besides expressing our sorrow and anger at having to discuss this sort of thing yet again , we should also think about what we can learn from it .
Parliament clearly needs to act here , and I hope that many Members will be aware of this obligation .
The Russian Federation became a member of the Council of Europe in 1996 .
So in Russia too we could help to initiate aid programmes , but these programmes will have to work .
Although that is a permanent state of affairs , it threatens to escalate next weekend , even for those people who are entitled to enter Bosnia-Herzegovina under the laws of that country , because transit rights will be denied them too .
That was a fatal flaw in the Paris negotiations .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe the problem in Bulgaria makes several things clear .
Today is the tenth of April .
It is therefore especially important to uphold the subsidiarity principle by enabling Member States to decide whether the practice of a profession should or should not be regulated .
This is a radical departure from the old thinking , which has viewed disabled people as objects of charity and pity .
The European Union 's role is to add value , and to assist the Member States through exchanges of information on best practice .
Securing non-discrimination and the right of access to all Community programmes is sensible and important .
I should like to take up just a few points .
Let me put a question : how many AIDS sufferers are there in the EU ?
We in the European Union should not give our backing to this misjudgement .
Because the fact is that poverty , need and lack of resources are the most significant causes of war .
I think the reverse would be more appropriate .
There were different views on the subject in committee too .
On the other hand , it is clear that in a region that ...
I think that is far too little .
I believe this project is likely to fall foul of practical problems or that these will at least make things far more difficult .
The producers of hardware and software , the providers , have just as much responsibility here as the families , the children and the youth organizations .
Content that is totally unacceptable for someone from an Islamic culture may be acceptable to someone from a more European culture .
This is absolutely necessary .
The third question we are currently considering is benchmarking .
On the whole , however , these reports tend in the right direction .
But
