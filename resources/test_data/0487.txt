state media was nourished by President Gbagbo 's accusations that Burkina Faso was at the root of the mutiny , without there being a shred of evidence .
Mr President , we are , in principle , in favour of setting up the Solidarity Fund .
I therefore foresee major problems when , after a few years , the financial balance sheet is drawn up .
I should note in this respect that it became abundantly clear during the process that the proposal on emissions trading is controversial .
Resistance to an emissions trading scheme will continue to exist among various parties and will lead to the rules being bypassed .
During all the difficult discussions , it was sometimes necessary to remind ourselves of what we are working towards , namely Kyoto .
It is still impossible to settle on one allocation method , be it grandfathering or auctioning , even within our group .
This is why companies and trade unions do not stand to gain anything from an opt-out .
Hopefully , we in Europe will be taking the historical decision to take the lead in actually setting up a definite scheme .
They are very interested in taking part in an international CO2 trading scheme .
Mr President , over the past few months , we in Parliament , and outside , have witnessed a heated debate on the greenhouse effect .
In other words , compared to our present way of doing things , we must use them differently .
The fact that this idea is based on an incorrect assumption is self-evident .
Mr President , I will wind up by saying that solutions for a better living environment and a better future are often not obvious , certainly not in today 's economic climate .
Not only the economic climate is a decisive factor in this matter , however .
In other words , the playing field may become too uneven , and you were right , Commissioner , to point out that this is unacceptable among national allocation schemes .
This is why we need an effective scheme .
I am able to say , with due pride , that the emissions trading scheme is already working well in the Member State from which I come .
Such a scheme of grandfathering , therefore , takes no account whatsoever of the reductions in energy consumption which have already been introduced within the Dutch market , and certainly in the German one , and also in a number of other countries .
- ( NL ) There is a desperate need for financial support for all eastern European countries , where , over the past decade , economies have collapsed and where no great improvements are expected in the foreseeable future .
How long do we intend to keep that country artificially alive with military power , leaders appointed from outside and external sources of funding ?
As is also underlined in the Brok resolution , the evaluation instruments for the application of the human rights clause in the association agreements are inadequate .
It intends to make it easier for people to move thousands of kilometres to regions with a different language and a different culture , where the scope for employment happens to be greater .
In 1998 and 1999 , Mr Paul van Buitenen , who was at the time a Commission official , demonstrated potential consequences , with the resignation of the entire European Commission as the eventual result .
I hoped that this was a misunderstanding but unfortunately , President Prodi persists in his opinion and is repeating his statement , which is , to say the least , injudicious .
If it continues in this vein , we are at risk of creating an instability pact , and surely this is not what we want .
No, indeed not .
Mr President , during the night of 26 to 27 September , the ship de Joola sank off the coast of Senegal , taking with it many Senegalese , a group of Europeans , and Roel and Lisette Arendshorst from Groningen .
I still have no reply .
My advice therefore would be to leave the Charter as it is , except for technical changes .
It is crucial for the rights of our citizens to be firmly anchored in the new constitutional Treaty that is being drafted .
The Commission proposes an asylum system that includes a refugee status and a subsidiary protection status .
The Member States should retain a certain level of policy freedom .
Nevertheless , I should like to make a few observations .
We believe that enough attention is being given to this aspect by ' Culture 2000' , the structural funds and the Socrates and Leonardo programmes , upon which the Commissioner , in fact , enlarged .
We must therefore strive for more competition within the European market , and one of the ways of achieving this is , for example , by making generic medicines available sooner , something on which a sound compromise has been reached within the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .
Finally , I should like to remark that the reinforcement of the role of patient organisations in this context is of course important at European level as well , including with a view to enlargement and to this centralised procedure .
In addition , we are in favour of more research into the effects of medicines on children .
To date , a large proportion of medicines administered to children has only been tested on adults , even though it is surely obvious that children are different from adults in terms of their metabolism , the necessary dosage and the administration method .
I welcome the compromise that has been reached , which offers protection that lasts eight years
