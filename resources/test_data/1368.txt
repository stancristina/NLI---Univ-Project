Are you prepared to say in your reply a little later on whether or not you will comply with the request made by the rapporteur , the Committee on Budgetary Control and this House to reply before 1 June 2010 and produce the documents requested in paragraphs 25 and 26 of the resolution ?
In the press , I have had some people accusing me , some of my fellow Members challenging me on this , saying : this is all well and good , but what you are writing puts wind in the sails of the Eurosceptics .
Even the strictest internal controls cannot prevent that .
It is to be welcomed that internal controls have been further tightened , but giving the vague impression that things are being covered up is unacceptable in my eyes , as it is not true .
Furthermore , I would like to underline , like my colleagues did , that the principles of proportionalities and necessity are key to the envisaged agreement .
It marks a huge departure from EU legislation and practice .
As a matter of fact , in 2004 , Parliament sought the annulment of the agreement with the US before the European Court of Justice .
A key element or key word here is proportionality , because it must be demonstrated convincingly that the same end cannot be achieved with less intrusive means .
They have a right to know that we uphold European law in international relations and in our internal policies .
The second problem is of a legislative nature .
The question and the concern are both legitimate .
I take the view that Greece should have been thrown out of the euro area once the budget misappropriations were discovered .
Commissioner Rehn told me last time that a country 's departure from the euro area would run counter to the ever closer union , but Greece is currently demonstrating where the limits of this ever closer union lie .
Our group , the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) , expects to see an ambitious commitment by the Commission to European economic governance before this 2020 strategy .
You can count on our support .
The older the population , the more cases of cancer can be expected .
Most importantly , the region suffers from scarce resources and the unequal access of different groups to these resources .
Also , the struggle for fertile farmland is an important root cause for the violent conflicts between Christians and Muslim settlers .
Only then can the perpetrators of the violent clashes have a fair and transparent trial .
Contrary to the wishes of the rapporteur , this customary law of Parliament 's has been violated in this case .
Social housing associations must receive encouragement and a substantial boost to ensure that they renovate the older buildings in the short term , so that the most disadvantaged tenants , too , can derive the maximum benefit from them .
In this report , we have sought to simplify the labelling of clothing , which is also a textile product , for example , by introducing European standardisation .
Monitoring and enforcement are very difficult in this area , which is why we have made proposals in this regard .
We have actually copied these word for word and hope that , with the support of the Commission and Parliament , the Council will change its mind and see things in a positive light .
We are starting with textiles , and I hope that this is eventually extended to all products for sale on the internal market .
Improving the energy efficiency of buildings is the most effective way of reducing energy consumption and emissions .
Finally , the Commission must assess the functioning of the directive in good time ; that is , by 1 January 2017 at the latest .
Member States must be able to adapt to circumstances .
Mr Simpson 's absence demonstrates that the issue is indeed still current , and that the consequences of such eruptions are unpredictable and can be far-reaching in terms of our citizens ' mobility , and also in economic terms if the situation is protracted .
Thus , as I see it , we need a European preparedness plan to enable the right decisions to be taken rapidly and the right contacts to be developed .
Can we obtain an assessment of this ?
We are talking about the direction , and also about implementation in the near future .
I do not know whether a vote will be held tomorrow , whether a consensus will be achieved on governance .
My report notes that we are currently spending one quarter of regional funds on research infrastructure and innovation .
The proposed EU 2020 strategy aiming to contribute to economic growth and employment seeks to provide this .
Objectives in those fields cannot be enforced at European level ; and rightly so .
It has been asked whose strategy this actually is .
Finally , integrated policy , particularly across sectors , is crucial ; the fragmentation of all kinds of new financing structures does no good and will not help us achieve this agenda .
This is the result of the historical process of creeping Islamification of Pakistani society since the late 1970s which has led to the alarming deterioration in the legal status of Pakistan 's Christian community .
The current economic crisis has hit the developing countries hard - and harder than the countries in the developed world - even though they are not responsible for the causes of this crisis .
I should have liked to see Mr De Gucht , the Commissioner for Trade , at your side , as we in this House are now endeavouring to catch up within the next five years .
The Millennium Development Goals are by no means on schedule
