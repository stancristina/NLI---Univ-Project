do anything it can to ensure that it takes place .
In this context the Commission welcomes the statement issued by the Chairman of the Canada-Europe Parliamentary Association , on the occasion of the recent EU-Canada interparliamentary meeting in Ottawa .
Given the changing nature of the European Union itself , Canada was the first industrialised third country to enter into a formal relationship with the European Economic Community in 1976 .
We want to find ways of working together more systematically in the field of security and foreign policy so that we can be more effective in carrying forward those policies where our objectives coincide .
In parallel with our comprehensive review of all aspects of EU-Canada relations , we have also been developing the framework for a new type of bilateral trade and investment agreement , with the aim of facilitating trade and investment flows between the EU and Canada .
The European Commission is resolved to do all it can to keep it that way .
I congratulate Mrs Rühle on her work , and we broadly support her proposals .
We must also call for the results of these programmes to be disseminated : the use of European taxpayers ’ money must be counterbalanced by an evaluation of the practical benefits of the actions receiving funds .
There is no doubting the need to promote active citizenship , both by supporting organisations working in this field and by promoting actions with this aim .
The structures created by the Community with the intention of promoting this European citizenship receive Community funding and might even have carried out work but do not reach the majority of the citizens .
On the one hand , greater transparency must be demanded of organisations receiving Community grants .
I therefore issue a universal challenge : promote real European citizenship now and make it compulsory for all Member State governments to hold referendums on this new Treaty , as many have already decided to do .
Let us , then , give a commitment to active European citizenship .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , first of all , I wish to emphasise the need for transparency , information and simplification in the field of Community grants .
The amendments tabled in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities changed the nature of the report and , what is worse , diverted it from the overall objective .
Furthermore , this programme must award operational grants to organisations active at European level in the field of equality between women and men .
Our main reasons for rejecting this proposal are : - the extension of SIS II to encompass new areas and functions , allowing undefined users – possibly even private operators ; - a confused and obscure jumble , out of which emerges an exaggerated and accelerated (ultra)federalist approach : for example , the prospect of creating a single and centralised ‘EU information system ’ – a real ‘Big Brother’ ; - a dangerous approach to cooperation with third countries , particularly with the USA and its ‘war on terrorism’ ; - inadequate and poorly-defined data protection .
On this point I have confidence that access for a greater number of authorities to SIS data will be moderate and rigorous and feel certain that only clearly indicated bodies ( Europol , Eurojust and Police Authorities ) will be able to access it and that the justification for this access will be objective and documented , in addition ...     .
The agreement that has just been rejected would , by introducing the principle of self-handling , promote social dumping and the gradual erosion of the salary and working conditions of the cargo handlers .
In the case of pilotage , the Member States would be given the necessary leeway for granting the necessary authorisation for tough rules and qualifications .
I am also surprised that , in the final vote , more than a dozen voting machines – all belonging to Members who were voting in favour – stopped working for some strange reason and that , despite their immediate complaints , the President did not restart the vote .     I congratulate Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou on her excellent report on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community action programme to promote organisations active at European level in the field of equality between men and women , which I fully support , in particular as regards the need for this programme to ensure that the various women’s organisations undertake high-quality actions that are extended for as long as it takes for them to achieve their aim .
I agree in particular with Mrs Lulling’s speech in the debate .
Although , on the one hand , there is an attempt to avoid the duplication of spending and to improve the coordination of activities in order to prevent wasted efforts and expenditure , on the other , the report takes particular care to ensure that the dignity of the human person – something that is so neglected in the least-developed regions – is given the respect it deserves , as well as reciprocal knowledge and understanding , factors that should govern all Union policies towards third peoples and States .
Attaining this objective will specifically require fully and effectively disseminating the Union’s values and objectives , using the media for example and involving the Community’s citizens in discussions and debates on European integration , relying on the multiplier effect of passing on their views .
The scant interest on the part of European citizens in European issues clearly reveals the urgent need to adapt some variables and to revise fundamental policies and attitudes .     –.The concept of ‘European citizenship ’ must not be an exclusively legal argument .
These proposals address the integration of these two international agreements into the Community legal framework .
