Vice-President of the Commission . - ( IT ) Madam President , honourable Members , I am very pleased that this House has voted unanimously , or virtually unanimously , in favour of the single European sky reform .
In all , once applied and working at full capacity , the entire reform , including SESAR , should lead to a total saving of approximately EUR 40 billion , and then the next important figure - and I think that this is close to Mrs Lichtenberger 's heart - is also that of the reduction in pollution , which will be substantial .
However , with regard to the issues raised by Mr Romagnoli concerning the airports in the city of Rome , I can say that , as usual , checks are always performed by the European Commission .
I would also say to Mr Evans that the criteria taken into consideration are the commercial value of airports and runway length , to which he referred .
I believe that the people of Europe , the world of enterprise do not expect across-the-board aid or mere legislative measures from us , but need to be shown that the institutions are capable of being there , are capable of supporting the citizens , entrepreneurs and all those who are committed to tackling this crisis .
It is merely a source of unfair speculation on the part of producers , on the one hand , and a creator of obvious environmental damage , on the other , since , as a result of this inescapable trap that consumers are caught in , hundreds of millions of phone chargers are being dispersed into the environment every two to three years .
I do not feel able fully to support Mr Seppänen 's report on the Community guarantee to the European Investment Bank against losses under loans and loan guarantees for projects outside the Community , but nor do I intend to vote against it .
Like the rapporteur , I believe the Commission should centre its attention primarily on setting quantifiable , achievable Community-wide targets .
I agree with the rapporteur that in order to address future challenges in the aviation market , above all in the field of air safety , a system of harmonised rules needs to be introduced at European level .
I agree with his assertion that a high level of food safety , consumer protection , environmental protection and the protection of animal health should be guaranteed , while considering the precautionary principle at all times .
The greenhouse effect , the hole in the ozone layer and climate upheaval are just a few of the phenomena that must become the centre of our attention as soon as possible , since they represent our fellow citizens and future children in Europe .
That is why I am in favour .
I have voted against Mr Böge 's report on the Mid-Term Review of the 2007-2013 Financial Framework .
I have voted in favour of the motion for a resolution on the stepping stone Economic Partnership Agreement between Côte d'Ivoire , of the one part , and the European Community and its Member States , of the other part .
What is more , I feel that they often do not meet the conditions of good governance , transparency of political positions and respect for human rights , without which there is a risk that damage to the population of those states would outweigh the aid they receive .
Global EPAs should in all cases be considered as complementary rather than as alternatives to the agreements based on the Doha Development Agenda , on which subject we call for the negotiations to be resumed as soon as possible .
This is the first time that Parliament has drawn up a single report on the work of the European Investment Bank ( EIB ) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( EBRD ) .
Rather than talking about cooperation between the banks and other interested parties , I think it would be appropriate first to ensure checks are performed before , during and after funding is granted , both banks having lent very significant sums in 2007 .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in order to ensure genuine access to justice for victims of breaches of competition rules , joint efforts must be made by the EU and the Member States .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of Mr Siekierski 's report on food distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community .
In my opinion it is therefore frankly unacceptable to sign economic agreements of this kind .
The increase in the price differential between production and consumption confirms the existence of serious distortions in the transfer of foodstuffs from field to plate in Italy .
I agree with the rapporteur that the growing concentration of marketing and distribution of foodstuffs has contributed significantly to the increase in consumer prices compared with producer prices .
The way forward should be a new policy of global commitment , in which the EU will play its key role .
I voted against Mr Millán Mon 's report on the state of transatlantic relations in the aftermath of the US elections , because I do not think it is right that the European Union , with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the corresponding foreign policy instruments , will take on a stronger and more coherent role on the international geopolitical stage .
Nowadays the Internet has become the basis for all our personal and institutional relations .
I have voted in favour of Mr Lambrinidis 's report on strengthening security and fundamental freedoms on the Internet .
I wholeheartedly support the aims of the draft , which are to involve all interested parties , to act on different levels using existing national , regional and international instruments
