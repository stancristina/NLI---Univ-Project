Concrete action is expected of the Finnish Presidency in energy policy , environmental policy , and , in particular , cooperation in the Baltic region in all its respects .
The Prime Minister said that transparency is essential .
The EU must have the support and approval of its citizens , and , for that , transparency , monitoring and accountability are important factors .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Prime Minister , I am sorry but your approach is more that of a careful civil servant or an apprentice rather than a leader , let alone visionary .
You barely acknowledged the importance of climate change .
We need a proactive , creative approach on the part of the EU President .
Otherwise , there will definitely not be any global agreement on how we are to continue protecting the climate after Kyoto , which is to say after 2012 , which is already quite close .
One of our greatest challenges is the explosive growth in the flow of illegal refugees .
Europe needs to develop an immigration policy fast , so that people from elsewhere in the world can move here to work completely legally .
You did not say anything about this .
In the Council , do you intend to take forward the decision that was taken on the fight against racism and xenophobia ?
You spoke too of transparency , which is welcome , but there are contradictions in what you say .
Today you spoke about developing internet search services .
I would especially like to endorse his concern regarding the justification of the Union’s existence , its legitimacy .
The huge amount of EU legislation , with all its meticulous detail , the vast and ineffective bureaucracy and the wholly disproportionate amount of monitoring and supervision make the Union objectionable .
Regarding the Constitutional Treaty , Finland has a splendid opportunity to take the initiative and show real leadership by initiating consultations regarding the extent to which it can be taken forward and what it should contain .
If the EU is to succeed in the context of global competition it will have to be made more competitive .
Hopefully , the Presidency will quickly succeed in simultaneously introducing legislation and programmes so that the meagre resources contained in the financial frameworks can start to be used .
Our largest industrial sector , the food industry , is also dependent on it .
I wish my country , Finland , every success in its Presidency .     Mr President , in recent debates I have heard two definitions of the Finnish Presidency .
It is not like that , however : Finland has a lot more to offer Europe and the Europeans .
The especially important priorities , Russia and energy , are areas where Finland has much expertise .
We totally lack a common policy on Russia and we cannot negotiate with Russia on an equal footing before we have one .
You also mentioned enlargement , which I see as one of the most important issues and an immense challenge .
The importance of this still obviously needs stressing , especially with regard to Turkey .
The old view of why the EU exists is no longer enough for our citizens .
Accordingly , it is time we established a new , common , definite idea of what the EU will like be in 10 or 20 years ’ time .
It certainly will not be brought to completion but it is important to start working on it in order for the relationship between the people and the EU institutions to be able to continue in a positive mood .     Mr President , many in this House are of the opinion that the Union’s credibility in the eyes of the people needs improving .
Criminals move freely from one country to another and network across national borders .
That is why Finland needs the support of the other Member States and this Parliament for its work when the decision-making process in justice and home affairs is being improved .     Mr President , Prime Minister , Mr President of the Commission , I wish to make three points .
First it must be well prepared .
The Finns have once again prepared themselves admirably .
The Finnish Presidency will once again be an excellent , objective one .
I would like to make a concrete proposal for the Lahti Summit .
There is an interesting correlation .
Those two things can go hand in hand .
Good luck to the Presidency .     .
Our task , however , that of the Council , Parliament and the Commission , is to ensure that the world’s four – or preferably 25 – best are European : that is our common responsibility .
I know that I will not get away with rhetoric with hardly any of you and I am not even going to try .
In this I have received very much good advice and guidance .
Some time ago , he drafted a report on the Finnish Presidency and was the first Member of the European Parliament whose acquaintance I briefly made when we were on the same committee jointly set up by the Finnish and the European Parliament .
He gave me some good advice : action , action , and action .
Mr Poettering made the apt comment that the presidencies form a six-month chain .
This chain is necessary .
There is a natural long-term aspect to all this among you .
We need the involvement of everyone in next spring ’s 50-year anniversary festivities and declaration , and I have welcomed those ideas that have been put forward here in this part-session .
I agree with Mr Schulz’s powerfully expressed view that the Union needs those tools which
