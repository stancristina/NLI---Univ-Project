the founding fathers of the European Union , Adenauer , Schuman , de Gasperi , Monnet and all the others , to hold steadfast to the ideals , and , as Mr Daul said , to keep the value of Europe , the European dream in mind at all times - not to overlook public concerns , but do what has to be done .
I have indicated to you that the question is whether these symbols - that are wonderful in their own right and I have nothing against them - should be enshrined in a constitution .
Seeing things only in terms of symbols would turn the Netherlands ' vision into a caricature .
You referred to the actions of a young media person .
I should like to remind you once again that when we held the presidency of the European Union , I repeatedly said that Europe is much more than a market and currency .
When we consider Europe 's future , we face the question as to what the challenge is we are facing .
It is my firm belief that we must spell out what we mean .
This is also the method by means of which we would like to say that national parliaments should be fully involved in what is happening in Europe .
I should now like to turn to the criteria of services of general interest , a subject that Mr Van den Berg raised , along with other questions .
The question is only - and I would like to ask the same question - whether this should be included in a Constitution or if other methods could be applied .
It is for precisely this reason that I repeat today that it is necessary that we look beyond the existing positions , that we should not take sides in Europe and that this , as I see it , can be done by means of an amending Treaty .
This is what is so good about Europe , that we can be different .
I experienced the debate with you today as extremely stimulating .
The process fell well short of the measure of international and regional standards for democratic elections .
That we should , emphatically , remain committed , and this is where I agree with the Council and the Commission in their conclusions .
And we have to wait and see , of course , how people in Nigeria come to table their own proposals on the question as to how credible elections can be held .
Do you , in light of these statements and this position , have a strategy , both tangible and intangible , for Nigeria , in fact , for the entire African continent ? on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( NL ) Madam President , President of the Council , Commissioner , as has already been stated , this CITES Conference will be the first to be held in Europe , and this offers an opportunity to bring the protection of wild animals and plants to the attention of the public at large , more so than before .
We should , however , ask ourselves how we can improve on things .
The resolution , unfortunately , rejects these proposals .
Kashmir was the exception to the rule .
The people of Kashmir did not , however , have any role in this .
With its environmental directives , including the Habitat Directive and the Bird Directive , the European Union has made a vital step towards the sustainable development of our continent .
Increased prosperity and wellbeing in Poland are in the interest of the whole of Europe .
The Commission was right to warn the Polish Government against the construction of this section of the motorway .
Moreover , in many cases , the old railway companies have not received from the state the compensation they thought they could count on beforehand for their operating shortages , and this has the effect of deterring new enterprises that would otherwise be keen to take part in tenders , and so the likelihood is that the railway network will be used less and less and that rolling stock will become unusable .
The same thing occurred years ago in the Czech Republic , which planned a connection from Prague to Dresden and also in Bulgaria when a link was planned between Sofia and Thessaloniki .
Moreover , the Natura 2000 status ensures that the nature conservation areas remain intact for posterity .
For traffic safety , it is necessary for the Via Baltica to be in place soon , provided it is tailored to regional circumstances with minimum adverse effects on the environment .
I am delighted that the Commission has issued warnings to the Polish Government , and that , when it received no response to its demands , it brought the matter before the European Court of Justice .
It also strikes me that the swift introduction of a burden sharing-mechanism is called for .
Commissioner Frattini will need to join forces with Commissioner Barrot in this .
I would urge you to fulfil the ambitions you enshrined in the Tampere and The Hague programmes , among others .
Most of the ALDE Group would beg to differ with the rapporteur and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the already much-debated crisis fund and crisis management in general .
After the last conference on this subject , I left in a frame of mind that was anything but optimistic , but I am heartened by the fact that an amendment concerning the need for a quality label for horticultural products , tabled by the ALDE Group , was adopted unanimously in the Agricultural Group by all parties .
It is , to my mind , a fantastic achievement and something we should hold onto .
