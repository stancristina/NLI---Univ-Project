We are now in an era of increasing Bosnian ownership and responsibility .
Before I outline some recent developments and our policy goals , let me apologise in advance if I have to leave the House before the end of the debate today .
So I hope we will be finished by 4 p.m.
The first real negotiating round took place at the end of January 2006 .
However , meeting this target date will entail Bosnia and Herzegovina being able to respond to all the EU reform requirements .
It is also essential to implement the agreement on the restructuring of the police forces , to adopt and implement all necessary public broadcasting legislation and , not least , to ensure sufficient legislative and administrative capacity to implement the agreement .
We thus have a very clear message : Bosnia and Herzegovina should seize the opportunity that it has at hand .
It is fair to say that the international community has played an important role in supporting the reforms in the country .
We are ready to support this process fully .
I met recently with the new HR/EUSR , Mr Schwarz-Schilling , who shares this view on a new role for the international community and the use of the Bonn powers .
In other words , it is necessary for the country to develop a democratic , functional and affordable multi-ethnic state in order better to serve all its citizens and to support the reforms that EU integration entails and necessitates .
Therefore , I welcome the recent efforts by the leading political parties and political leaders to find practical and workable solutions to these very important challenges .
We do not expect a constitutional revolution but rather an evolution .
The constitutional evolution is not as such a condition for concluding the negotiations on a stabilisation and association agreement .
I look forward to engaging with the European Parliament again on a future occasion on the progress made in Bosnia and Herzegovina .     .
We should all be satisfied with the negotiations on the stabilisation and association agreement , which has got off to a very good start with Bosnia and Herzegovina , although we have to recognise that there are still many challenges for the country to tackle .
It is about implementation , implementation , implementation in Bosnia and Herzegovina .
Many of you have stressed the need for economic development and I fully share that view .
In the communication we are proposing the setting-up of a regional free trade agreement to replace the current 31 bilateral free trade agreements , in order to encourage trade and investment and thus production and job creation in the area .
My sincere thanks go to him for that .
In many countries , such as Finland and Sweden , its importance to the economy is crucial .
Aside from production , forestry provides employment for a cluster of industries related to it , among which is the very considerable metal and electrical engineering industry .
The EU , however , has no common forestry plan , although many areas of policy , such as rural development and environmental policy , impact greatly on this sector .
The tone of the report suggests that there is no desire to create new bureaucracy similar to the European Union’s agricultural policy .
There have to be better guarantees for the success and future of a sector of industry that employs sustainable , renewable natural resources .
We in the EU need to learn to rationalise our policies so as to be able to perform new tasks with the resources currently available , without always establishing new agencies .
I await the Commission ’s new proposals with interest .     – Mr President , I wish to thank my colleague , Mr Kindermann , particularly for successfully probing into the issue of what European policy on forestry is and what it should be doing .
Wood as a raw material has many properties which remain unexploited .
There is a lot of potential in the foodstuffs industry ; for example , in the production of healthy foods .
Mr President , the rapporteur , Mrs McGuiness , has drafted an excellent report on the Commission ’s proposal on guidelines for rural development .
These regions , however , lag behind others when certain indicators are applied .
For example , unemployment is greater in these areas .
A comprehensive reform in agricultural policy has been initiated , and as a result agriculture is becoming less able to employ and sustain the population in rural areas .
The strategic guidelines are based on the EU Regulation on the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development , the text of which was adopted last year .
The debate on the report is nevertheless overshadowed by the Council’s terrible proposal for the EU’s financial perspective for the next seven-year term .
As a consequence , we have to wait until this issue is revisited in the finance negotiations between Parliament and the Council , and the situation is corrected as is only right and proper .
We must insist on this .
Mr President , aid from the European Union and the Member States to improve the world’s water situation totals EUR 1.4 billion a year , which makes us the biggest single contributor of aid .
One fifth of the world’s population , some 1.1 billion people , suffer from a lack of clean water .
This is not just a matter of unsustainable development : it also has to do with a threat to security .
Decisions regarding how and when water should be distributed , and to whom , are not just made at national level , but also by local authorities , in the private sector and within the domain of civil society .
Aid is needed in particular in order to increase regional decision-making and cooperation ,
