unlike tobacco , these are produced to make people better .
I therefore believe that the Commission has done a sterling job , and I shall therefore advise the majority of my group to reject the amendments tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
Given the harmful effects smoking has on health , including for non-smokers due to passive smoking , our group is in favour of a total ban on advertising for tobacco products .
I should , however , like to urge the European Commission to continue its search for ways of reducing the use of tobacco , particularly where young people are concerned .
However , I should like to add that it seems to me to be necessary that the ban on tobacco advertising , if it has a cross-border effect , should be put on an equal footing across all Member States .
In this connection , I regret that his report is not being debated together with that by Mr Medina Ortega today .
We should also condemn the anomaly that , although we give tobacco growers EUR 1 billion every year , we find it difficult to produce a comprehensive strategy to restrict the use of tobacco .
This means for me that we should endorse the Commission 's proposal without any amendments , for the alternatives are inferior .
This is what people expect from us and that is also what we are definitely competent to do .
This means that if the maritime environment is in a bad state , the fishing industry , in particular , will bear the brunt of this .
We should , however , ensure that we do justice to historical catch rights in the new common fisheries policy ; these should not be jeopardised .
Policy and management are dependent on the support base within the sector .
In two consecutive elections , the population left no doubt as to its democratic and pro-European persuasion .
This is also in line with the aspiration for a more transparent government that will crack down hard on corruption .
Slovakia 's new government has announced initiatives in this connection , and we are awaiting the reports with interest and some trepidation .
Moreover , I am of the view that the position of the Roma in the enlarged European Union will be so unique that the Convention will have no choice but to devote attention to it .
We have very long-standing relations with Turkey , not only in the EU as a candidate or imminent candidate , but also mainly as a NATO member .
I also believe it to be of crucial importance for us to keep saying to Turkey that our opinion , as adopted in Helsinki , is as follows : we cannot start membership negotiations until you have met the political criteria of Copenhagen .
I reject a line of reasoning of this kind .
Was this European pledge necessary to let Turkey move in the direction of a constitutional state ?
This serves a practical purpose .
If the truth be told , the two extreme scenarios are not very helpful in this discussion .
I applaud Mr Brok 's flexibility and I also applaud his opinion here today , but this attitude as he expressed today is not compatible with the support expressed by himself as rapporteur , for one of Mr Ferber 's amendments which states that a special relationship should be established between the EU and Turkey .
I should like to echo the words of Commissioner Verheugen in this connection .
Another point is Turkey 's candidature .
The EU can offer Turkey closer cooperation in various areas , but the candidate status was a mistake that should , ideally , be put right .
Moreover , this area has a lot to do with our sense of identity , which only increases the potential for tension among Member States .
In the euphoria of the moment , we should not be blind to the various problem areas .
Mr President , the youngest generation can hardly imagine a continent rent asunder and the permanent threat of war between East and West .
The very narrow-minded French national self-interest makes the implementation of agricultural reforms impossible .
Being a Member of the European Union is more difficult than becoming one .
A positive example is the report by Mr Jan Mulder in the Committee on Budgetary Control .
My political statement that it is not our political , or our personal , merit that we were born on the sunny side of the Iron Curtain and that it is through no fault of their own that the acceding countries had to live in our shadow for so long , was taken on board with due respect .
We have communicated too little , and this means that uncertainty , or latent gut feelings , have a chance of surfacing , and enlargement degenerates into a political game with short-term gain .
Preparation for enlargement is a top priority that is rightly seen by the European Commission as an exercise in managing the diversity of cultures , administrative traditions and economic structures .
There is a great danger that it will again end up as a discussion document , resulting in fine words and intentions but not meaning anything concrete in terms of legislation .
We have already spent some time discussing this in our committee and with our Commissioner .
We also believe that the problem does not lie with the Commissioner alone , but also and in particular with the Commission as such and with the Council .
In practice however this is still not happening .
When can we expect to see this specific regulation ?
I would again ask for attention to be given to the place of the regions , this is becoming an important issue .
