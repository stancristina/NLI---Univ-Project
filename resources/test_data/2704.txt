issue .
For aid to be continued , and it has been the western consultancy agencies that have done better out of it than Russia has , Russia is being told to continue with its 'policy of reforms ' .
The European Parliament 's resolution therefore wanted poverty , racketeering and corruption to continue in Russia before we supply it with the TACIS new technology aid .
In practice this might mean that our aid programme to Russia will end .
The best human rights policy for Russia would be if the EU ended aid to Yeltsin .
I am referring here to the urgent and fundamental reforms needed in MEPs ' salaries and travel expenses .
For this we need a single-alternative policy : travel expenses may only be claimed for bona fide costs incurred .
Mr President , it was stated in this Chamber earlier on today that the European Union budget sends an important message to the citizens of Europe about what issues the Union considers important .
In the draft budget we are now discussing there is a proposal for a new item covering measures to combat social exclusion .
The Council of the European Union has begun a campaign of global solidarity .
Everyone agreed that the reason for the Commissioner 's absence was perfectly understandable .
Everybody must surely realise how important it is to clean up emissions from buses and lorries .
I would like to propose , however , that we should be a little more ambitious in one respect , namely the matter of particulate emissions .
It may interest all of you who are still sceptical that the ACEA , the trade association for the car industry , appears to regard this as technically feasible .
But we in Parliament have already stated in the Auto-Oil programme that we wish to give a clear signal to industry and , with that in mind , we want binding limit values , as Mr Lange proposes .
We have given a signal that we want new generation catalysts and filters for particles that are a danger to health .
Madam President , hopefully the speeches that come after the keynote speeches of the Commission and the Council will not be of any less value than those that preceded them .
Our success will be determined according to how well we are able to meet the challenges of the future .
In a world ravaged by one crisis after another , European stability is regarded highly even by those , who , for various reasons , have opposed European cooperation .
In economic policy we have to pay special attention to those areas of European cooperation which our citizens judge to be important .
For this we can thank the United Kingdom , which held the previous presidency , and the current holder , Austria ; we have got to grips with issues much more so than before .
The international economic crisis is unfortunately creating pressures for Europe too .
The initiative still to be discussed this year on the EU 's northern dimension will create much-needed sustained and systematic cooperation between Russia and the EU.
The right policy is not to freeze TACIS resources but , as I said , redirect them more efficiently than before .
The Commission 's document was very technical and perhaps even meandered somewhat .
Convergence is such a complicated and unpredictable matter that reports should at least not end up making it even more obscure .
My position is based on advocating an open European information society for everyone , in which there is no division between the information-rich and the information-poor .
Regardless of its mode of dissemination , it has great social and cultural value .
Likewise , the SME sector , which employs so many , must have a basic right to flexible access to the new , integrated environment .
To safeguard the availability , interchangeability and multi-functionality of the networks , the transmission of information has to be regulated within the terms of a standard regulatory framework .
I have in mind a model for flexible regulation .
It will not hamper competitiveness in European industry , but will actually aid it .
I did not approve of the delay in drafting this report : on the contrary , when it comes to competitiveness , we have to press on .
Competition already exists , for example , among the telephone and the cable television networks and between the fixed telephone network and mobile phones .
We most definitely do not need a European supervisory authority to take responsibility for content or services .
For example , recently in my own country , Finland , there has been an explosion in the number of mobile phones , which is showing no signs of abating .
They are used for paying bills , for surfing the net and playing computer games , and soon you will be watching TV programmes on them .
The mobile is a way of life : you are always close by , yet you have your freedom .
Auctioning would lead to monopolies , and then the American and European giants would start dividing up the frequencies among themselves .
Under the Treaty of Amsterdam , the preferential treatment that public service broadcasters are getting is bound by special conditions governing the content and quality of programmes .
Mr President , many thanks to the Commissioner for what was a very colourful and arresting speech .
That is something we want to assert strongly .
The big question is how we can work together so that both culture and business and firms both large and small can operate successfully .
It is an important one .
There is good reason to adopt this approach .
Directives have to be supplemented as we acquire more scientific evidence , such as the evidence we have now obtained on oak and beech wood .
