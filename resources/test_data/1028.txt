capitalist mechanism and police state being built up by the European Union are capitalist society 's response to the rising tide of protest and demands for justice being generated by its own anti-grass roots policy of serving the interests of big business .
The leaders of the ÅU know full well that , despite their efforts , they cannot fool the people by cloaking their policies in pro-grass roots terms .
The perpetrators of and accessories to the terrorist attacks have played straight into the hands of the American and European imperialists .
According to article 1 , anyone fighting for fundamental political and social change can easily be labelled a terrorist .
The only people above all suspicion are the rulers of the ÅU and the USA .
Likewise , they also know that violence and suppression cannot reverse the historic advance of mankind and they will continue their fight until all the terrorist laws have been repealed .
( EL ) The report on the basic technical principles for monitoring BSE tackles the right issues in the right way .
For example , although we do not disagree with the proposal on reforming the common agricultural policy per se , what worries us is that the Commission may use it to cut back on subsidies or the production of basic agricultural products .
Finally , we should like to point out that , as long as reducing production costs , no matter how , and increasing the profits of the huge monopolies in the sector continues to be the primary and decisive criterion for producing which agricultural products and food , the problems will not only not go away , they will multiply .
As a union of nations , it expresses itself through the European Parliament and , as a union of states , it expresses itself through the national executives , which in turn rely on the trust placed in them by their national parliaments .
What all this means is that we urgently need national constitutional reforms , as Giorgio Napolitano explains in his exceptional report , so that the Member States ' European policy can be constantly baptised in the waters of the national parliaments .
However , what we do not need is for the national parliaments to be represented in a new European institution which gets bogged down in what is , whichever way you look at it , a lot of European red tape .
It is true , Mr President , that involving the national parliaments in the European structure does not imply new institutions , it implies increasing their powers of control and information vis-à-vis their own people .
In-depth debates are needed , either in plenary or in special parliamentary committees , so that delegates come here to state not just their own personal opinions but the more general line of thinking of their parliaments .
This is something I have yet to see in the parliaments of the Member States of the European Union , in Greece at least .
I thank the Minister for his reply .
Two have died , the most recent from tonsillitis in October 2001 .
It is a matter for the Greek Government , but the Greek Government does not have the necessary clout , whereas the European Union has a much greater chance of succeeding .
I also find it hard to understand why the Council does not know that members of the Communist Party of Turkey are being prosecuted , given that 150 members have been arrested and their offices have been raided , all from the day it opened for business .
My question is this : what talks are you holding with the United States , what can you do to make them change their mind and what information do you have on the matter ?
Mr President , I must congratulate Mr Ìusotto on his report , which is a job extremely well done .
This means that governments need to get the message , especially in the light of the new regulation now being applied , which is more decentralised than the previous regulation , and do what they can to bring about the results which other countries have achieved .
Consequently , 0.45 % of the Community GDP earmarked for the Structural Funds must be the lower limit .
Is it because we are spending so much money that we object every time the Community budget increases ?
Of course , our starting point is fundamentally contradictory .
So our objective must be to help the new regions where they need help , but without abandoning the old regions which also need help , when they need help .
Mr President , this proposal for a directive seeks to extend speed restrictions , which already apply to some commercial vehicles , to other categories of passenger and goods vehicles , i .e . to lighter commercial vehicles than those to which the restrictions already apply .
And basically , I agree with the European Commission 's proposal .
I should like to dwell for a moment on common sense .
The first concerns the exemption , which we propose should be 5 years from when the directive enters into force for category Ì2 and Í2 vehicles weighing between 3.5 and 7.5 tonnes .
They have ideological , political reasons and they do not think that the European Commission , or rather the European Union , should intervene here .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Euro-Mediterranean cooperation is a political vision and a vital project for the EU.
The aim of this own initiative report is to assess policy to date , to urge the European Union to implement all the necessary policies to promote the social , political and economic rights of women in the Mediterranean and to urge the partner countries to assume their responsibilities and rise to the challenges inherent in this objective by all possible means
