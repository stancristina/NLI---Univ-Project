the need arises - to beyond the European Union countries ?
For example , in Mozambique I found it quite extraordinary that the Indian navy was on the other side of the Indian Ocean and could have come to Mozambique very quickly , but nobody ever involved them in disaster relief in Mozambique , while people were hanging on trees .
Commissioner , thank you very much for your statement .
I strongly welcome this rapid reaction facility .
It responds to long-held concerns which many of us have had .
You are to be congratulated on the work that you have done .
I should like to elaborate on the point which my colleague Nirj Deva mentioned .
We are not just talking about urgency , we are not just talking about effectiveness of action .
The question of coherence is very important .
You have the overall responsibility for external relations from the Commission 's point of view .
I am thinking again of the role of ECHO .
Do you not foresee an opportunity here to bring ECHO under your policy-making umbrella so that we have a more cohesive approach to emergencies when they arise ; so that we do not have this problem of different instruments ; so that we are addressing the problem with one mind and can then deliver with urgency and efficiency ?
Mr President , I am sure the Commissioner would agree that writing the report is the easy bit .
The practical implementation is the difficult bit .
When this rapid reaction force actually comes together , will it work in certain cases at a regional basis as well as an individual nation basis ?
There are situations , such as that in the Horn of Africa , which cover more than one state .
The problems in the Great Lakes region cover a number of countries .
It would be useful if you could link these problems on a regional basis and act from that point .
Would the Commissioner agree with that ?
Mr President , may I thank the Commissioner for that excellent and comprehensive answer , which goes a long way to reassuring me .
May I ask him to confirm that the Commission 's choice not to participate in certain meetings will be taken , as he put it , on a 'meeting by meeting ' basis , not a structure by structure basis , depending on what is being discussed .
To take a decision structure by structure would indeed create an unfortunate precedent , undermining the acquis communautaire , which is that the Commission takes part in all Council meetings and preparatory meetings .
Indeed it would be counter to the Treaty , which states that the Commission is "fully associated " , not partially associated , with the CFSP and that it will remain the Commission 's choice whether to participate or not .
Mr President , if the Council does not agree with the Commission , does that mean the Commission will have to take the Council to the European Court in order to participate in the military committee ?
Secondly , has the Commission drawn any conclusions as to the security implications of its participation in the military committee ?
Mr President , I hope I can risk Mrs Izquierdo 's wrath by saying that I agree with the Commissioner .
I want to put it to her that it is far better to reduce the rate of growth in agriculture in order to protect the money that is currently going to the very poor in this world , because the alternative would be to squeeze further the budget lines in category 4 .
It would be unacceptable to find money for Kosovo - which I support - at the expense of the very poor in the world .
Does the Commissioner agree with that ?
Question No 40 by (H-0332/00 ) : Subject : Institutional reform In the Action Plan on Reform it is stated that an 'external legal expert ' should sit in an advisory capacity on Disciplinary boards .
What is the excact definition of this 'external legal expert ' , and what legal expertise will this person be required to have ?
The Commission is at present implementing , or preparing legal grounds for implementing , the different actions set out in the White Paper on reforming the Commission .
In his question the honourable Member is probably referring to actions 57 and 58 of the Reform Strategy Action Plan which , amongst other things , specifies commitment to making proposals for the establishment of an interinstitutional disciplinary board .
The Action Plan does not , however , specify that an external legal expert should sit on the board .
The Commission will be presenting detailed proposals for the modernisation of disciplinary procedures and related arrangements in a consultative document which is scheduled for publication in October .
The document will include recommendations for improving administrative procedures and for making relevant amendments to the Staff Regulations .
Consultation on those proposals is a legal requirement and the views of Parliament and Member States , as well as those of the staff , will naturally be taken into account on all relevant matters , including the possible use of external expertise on the interinstitutional disciplinary board .
I thank the Commissioner for his reply .
Following on from the Van Buitenen affair and the Commission 's fairly lamentable reaction to it , is there not a case that these disciplinary boards - and especially those called for whistle-blowers - should be independent of the Commission altogether ?
.
I am grateful to the honourable Member for his question .
The affair of Mr van Buitenen was conducted completely in compliance with the existing Staff Regulations and however tested , I am sure that any fair-minded person is bound to come to that conclusion .
