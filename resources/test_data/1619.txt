Moreover , there was criticism from Parliament that we have heard nothing of today .
The Presidency is very pleased with the Commission 's proposals .
This is something that Mr Clegg mentioned , and I believe Mrs Frassoni also talked about .
We had an excellent meeting in Brussels on 1 October , which I believe both Mrs Frassoni and Mr Swoboda attended , and I sensed that we were very close to reaching tangible agreement on a number of points .
The Council can make concessions on some points , for example these alternative or weak forms of regulation that Mrs Frassoni spoke about .
Then there are other matters which are more difficult , for example comitology , where it is well known that different countries have different traditions ; but let us now reach agreement on as much as possible .
I am prepared to continue the dialogue , which has unfortunately been extended and interrupted .
Let us resume this dialogue , and let us ask our government officials to give us a basis for discussion in the near future .
The new work programme will be presented to the Council in December : probably on 9-10 December .
I am convinced that the upcoming Presidencies will pay due regard not only to the Commission work programme but also to the views on the work programme that Parliament has expressed and is going to express in the days ahead .
As I happen to be President of the Council which deals with such matters , I should like to confirm everything Mr Vitorino said .
I would say to Mr Titley , who called for a policy towards our new neighbours after enlargement , that , the day before yesterday , the General Affairs Council in Brussels worked out a more long-term strategy , to be implemented in cooperation with the candidate countries ; a strategy that shall ensure that these new borders towards the east are cooperative borders rather than another Iron Curtain .
As I announced yesterday , the General Affairs Council recommended the day before yesterday at its meeting in Brussels that accession take place on 1 May , and that the brand new Commission , including Commissioners from the new Member States , take office on 1 November , so that the new Parliament has enough time to approve the new Commissioners .
But this is all just a recommendation .
I mentioned it yesterday because it is of course only possible with the cooperation of Parliament , and it is in the spirit of this good working relationship that I mentioned the Council 's thoughts .
We are completely open to Parliament 's thoughts on the subject . - ( DA ) The Brok report contains numerous directions for the future Member States , which on some points beg the question as to whether this is really something the EU should interfere in .
The report contains some very positive elements .
Turkey must of course meet the requirements on human rights and democracy before there can be any talk of proper negotiations for its accession , but we oppose the reactionary line of thinking that wants to turn the EU into a white , Christian - it is tempting to use the word ' Aryan' - club .
The meeting reflected the intensity and depth of the cooperation between the EU and Russia .
As you know , there was a major problem , which has been discussed many times in Parliament , that is , Kaliningrad .
The agreement represents a balance between the interests of the candidate countries , Russia and the EU.
The fact that a solution could be found to the problem confirms the strength of the cooperation between the EU and Russia ; and at the same time the EU asserted that it attaches the utmost importance to respect for the sovereignty of the candidate countries and effective border controls on the EU 's external borders .
We stood firm on the principles that Lithuania is a sovereign country and that it has as much right to join cooperation on Schengen as all the other candidate countries .
Consensus was reached , and I can add that President Adamkus of Lithuania , too , accepted the agreement which was entered into .
This was a key point for both parties .
The declaration and the accompanying cooperation plan are indications that cooperation between the EU and Russia on this point is moving on from an exchange of information to practical cooperation .
There was a frank debate on the situation in Chechnya .
I know that Commissioner Patten has already spoken of the extraordinarily open debate which took place .
Both sides must respect human rights , and the EU must insist that those who do not are brought to justice .
The EU will also demand that the international community be given the opportunity to provide the urgently needed humanitarian aid to Chechnya .
Regional conflicts , particularly the one in Moldova , were also discussed .
The European Union stressed the need for progress on the economic and legal reforms in Russia in order to ensure Russian membership of the WTO .
By way of conclusion , I am able to call the summit a success , with a constructive dialogue in all fields .
I almost saw myself in the role of one of those Members of Parliament who demanded that now the Presidency should do this and that and pointed out that the Council had failed to do this or that or the other .
I will not , moreover , continue now with a 'but ' . I will continue with an 'and' , because I have always understood our common approach to mean that we must also be good neighbours ,
