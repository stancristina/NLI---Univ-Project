The reform of agricultural policy , the structural funds , and the financing of the enlargement , will all show one thing very quickly : that the enlargement does not come at zero cost .
The dealings with Turkey were governed by ambiguity and deviousness , one-sidedness and exclusion .
Why are refugees sent back to Turkey , if torture is going on there ?
It was less than nine years ago , yet worlds away .
( Applause ) Mr Juncker , you are right .
When we in Germany manage to make a political change of course , we in Europe can probably learn to go actually together in a correct - more productive and with more effect on employment - direction .
We see that the Arab world demands much more from Europe than we can give at this time .
For this purpose we need a convincing total concept , which does not consist of transferring national legal systems to the Community , but which ensures that there are legal instruments with Community effect where Community trade is possible .
On the contrary , here one of them has used his great influence to achieve unanimity for results which can be put into effect .
Here I would like to say to the Council Presidency that this European Parliament has certainly always done the house tasks very quickly .
We must fight against that together , on the one hand the European Commission as the motor of agreement in our institutional structure , and on the other hand you will find in the European Parliament , or at least large parts of this Parliament , massive support for sensible and far-reaching institutional reform .
Where is the legislation in the follow-up to BSE , where is what we want ?
I am sorry if that upsets you , please pass it on to your colleagues !
I only say that many railway strikes in France , many lorry strikes in other Member States are linked to the fact that people have the feeling that the Commission owes us proposals for the promised harmonization of conditions , particularly in the social field .
But when they arrive in Brussels , these things remain in the inter-governmental area and are not passed to the European Parliament , even in accordance with the construction of the Treaty of Amsterdam , not as the legislative Chamber and very often not even for consultation .
I say quite openly that on the one hand it is right that the number of legislative projects is reduced after the stormy internal market development .
The second is the question of Mr Gaulider , the member of parliament , and I believe that we on the European side cannot emphasize too much that the Gaulider question must be solved .
But as there is no such proposal by the Commission , we are in a very hypothetical question and answer game here .
So I would like to tell you that I understand your question very well , but I will give you my answer outside the door .
Internal risk models are not yet sufficiently developed for banking supervision purposes , and the banks must be allowed to continue working with the extended maturity bank models up to the end of the transitional period .
I believe that this is also an important way in which we can achieve a reduction in tobacco consumption .
That is impossible and it is antisocial anyway .
My husband smokes 60 cigarettes a day , and in the course of a long marriage I have given up trying to get him to stop .
Madam President , Mr Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , for years the subject of leghold traps has regularly featured on our agenda .
I particularly have in mind indigenous trappers and animal protection organizations .
Sports foods in particular need to be properly controlled , because consumers ' health is at stake , they have to be protected against false and inaccurate claims , not to mention the effect of such foodstuffs .
Like others in this House , my group is calling for a ban on pesticides in baby food , although I have to say that we believe this criterion will be met if the limit value set is close to the detection limit .
Secondly , NGOs - especially church NGOs , but also many private initiatives - have partners on the ground whom they can trust and with whom they can work very well , and who also know the local structure very well .
I would request that you take note of two comments which have to be made before we move on to voting .
Mr President , Mr Pompidou is absolutely right .
Does this mean that Europe can also wait two or three years , or even longer , or does it mean that we should initiate the main phases of the emission reduction process independently of the Americans ?
If we assume that in the long term each citizen on the planet should produce equal amounts of CO2 , then we in the industrialised countries naturally have to achieve a much more substantial reduction than all the proposals discussed at Kyoto .
But German unity was also a success for the environment , since it allowed inefficient industrial installations to be replaced by efficient plant .
I therefore believe that we urgently need to extend the scope of our research .
The climate agreement is neither one thing nor another .
I too believe that we should stick with our ambitious target .
This means that in Europe profits and even jobs , let us be honest , are linked with the death of innocent people in Africa .
It is clear that even if our conditions were met , we are still unlikely to see peace in this region , so deplorable
