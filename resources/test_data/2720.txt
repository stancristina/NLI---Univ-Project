As the Kindermann report shows and as Commissioner Fischler has just acknowledged , the era of MAGPs is now in the past ; we will , in future , no longer be able to operate using this harsh , short-sighted and authoritarian method of regulating the fishing effort .
We must , in particular , jointly combat the destructive effects of emigration , which is draining these countries of their human skills .
I feel that , if Parliament were to upset the balance achieved by the Council , we would be doing more harm than good , if only because we would be delaying the potential entry into force of this urgently needed directive .

This cooperation , which I undertook to strengthen , is all the more necessary since we are facing an increase in various forms of radicalism and intolerance , which points to a lack of dialogue and understanding between cultures .
I am sure that the positive effects of this will be felt in both the short- and long-term .
