with the Stability Pact requires an approach involving budgetary restriction .
Ferber report ( A5-0068/2000 )
I would therefore like to draw the President ' s attention to this matter , quite frankly , and say that , if it is retained in Wednesday ' s agenda , I reserve the right to table a motion under Rule 143 of the Rules of Procedure .
According to the estimates of the Economic and Social Committee , there are more than five million children working in Europe .
Today we have been discussing what we need to prevent and combat , and that is the circulation and distribution of child pornography , which has been increasing at an alarming rate .
As has already been stressed , the aim is to intensify actions to prevent and combat the sexual abuse of children , with particular reference to the production , possession and distribution of child pornography through the Internet .
It was jointly organised by the Austrian and United States Governments and the Commission under the STOP Programme .
In order to fight against it , it proposed a multiannual Community action plan on promoting safer use of the Internet by combating illegal and harmful content on global networks .
We are convinced that agreements on common definitions , common charges and common sanctions need to be established for certain forms of crime .
These could be aimed at promoting further training and exchanges between those responsible in the Member States for fighting against this phenomenon , such as the police authorities , but also the judiciary , and at close cooperation between those authorities , Europol and the future Eurojus network .
We feel it is right that the fund should have an emergency component , which would apply to cases of a massive influx of people in a situation where they need international protection , but which , at the same time , guarantees that structural policy measures will be financed .
To confuse them would be to give way to populist rhetoric .
So Amsterdam provided two new elements in addition to the principle introduced in Maastricht in accordance with which Member States are obliged to adopt measures comparable to those they take to combat fraud harming their own financial interests .
It is therefore understandable that legislation for preventing and combating fraud should have developed independently for the CAP and not in relation to the general rules which apply to the whole budget .
Reform of the Commission cannot continue to be seen as a stream of meaningless clich√©s and as a hypothetical discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of various models of ex ante and ex post control and of decentralisation .
- ( PT ) Mr President , because of problems stemming from large-scale fraud in the production of wine and other types of fraud , we are more aware that EAGGF Guarantee Section appropriations are frequently used to promote the products of large-scale farming operations whose only real aim is to obtain subsidies , without even considering whether there is a market for these products .
The key aim of defining a new world-wide strategy for the European Union within a world economy that is open , competitive and truly global was achieved .
The European Council will annually monitor the progress that has been made , by holding a European Council meeting each spring .
Just yesterday , President Prodi presented the Commission ' s programme in this area to the Council and also to the various Council formations , and it is therefore crucial that we bear in mind the diversity of platforms on which the strategy laid down in Lisbon was developed , with its implications for the fields of scientific research , education , the single market , industry and so forth .
The Research Council will assume responsibility for the e-Europe Action Plan and for promoting the establishment of a European research area .
It should be borne in mind that implementing the remits decided in Lisbon will require close cooperation between the Commission , the Council and the European Parliament , since many of the laws to be adopted are subject to the codecision procedure .
I must ask this , however : do the statements by those currently in power in Europe , who are , in the majority , Socialists , and who , for various years have headed the governments of their respective countries , not above all reveal more about their shortcomings and the serious failures of the European development model which they have been promoting ?
There is nevertheless one aspect that deserves a particular mention in the area of policies for full employment .
We believe that the role of governments should instead be to focus on developing means to enable social and economic agents to generate wealth and to produce positive results in these areas .
The European Union may have begun its race towards levels of development already seen in America ' s economy and businesses , but this , the real Europe , will not become a reality until the convergence of national economies and internal economic and social cohesion are given top priority .
To call it the Employment Summit , however , would be to depart from its real purpose .
Secondly , a strategic debate on employment would have to start with a substantial analysis of the European Union ' s agents of competitiveness , because that is what sustainable economic growth depends on , and hence employment and social well-being .
A far-reaching debate on the problem of employment in the European Union would inevitably , therefore , have to address these issues properly .
This requires a European employment policy with its own budget , linked to the Structural Funds policy that the European Council does not want to blindly accept .
