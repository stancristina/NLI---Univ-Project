Madam President , gene technological manipulation has nothing whatsoever to do with conquering world hunger .
That is an important task in which agriculture , the food distributors and ultimately the consumers must cooperate in order to be able to remain healthy in their old age .
The European Parliament , the Council and the Commission must combine their forces and use the humanitarian aid just agreed on worth 34 million German marks in particular for the women , who are especially burdened and needy .
What kind of concept of honour is that ?
But we must also consider and say that the international community of states is really called upon to do everything in its power - and this applies not just to Mauritania , but also to other states where slavery still exists - to bring this situation to an end .
We should not talk them into it .
Mr President .
The European Parliament has moreover always said : " The door is open and it will remain open ' , but of course on condition that general , universal human rights are recognizedd , and I hope that we in the European Parliament can continue to speak positively in favour of this .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , classical case for the EU to prove that it is serious about a common foreign and security policy , for the comprehensive banning of these tests has been signed by all EU Member States .
Mr President , I had asked the Commissioner to tell us in concrete terms what the Commission plans .
Of course I wish that the SLIM programme would be reflected very much more quickly and more clearly in solid results which everyone can see .
If Parliament is trying to implement the SLIM programme then I cannot quite work out why it wants to be included in point 15 and 16 even during the individual monitoring procedures of the Commission in the context of SLIM.
For a historically-aware person this system inevitably calls to mind the compulsory labour of the Middle Ages , but in those days they had the advantage that they just had to supply one tenth , whereas today the State usually requires considerably more than 10 % of the income of the working time .
I would also suggest that for example the Economic and Social Committee should concern itself more intensively with these problems , for relieving the load on business leads to more jobs .
The Member States must , on the basis of their legal and administrative regulations , take the required measures to guarantee the establishment , bookkeeping , inclusion and allocation of these own resources .
As far as the task of reforming the finance order is concerned , the Commission considers itself to be fully covered on the whole line .
It is a question of the Union 's own resources and the way we treat them , the correct way to collect them and pass them on to the European Union .
We then check only if the inspection is financially worthwhile .
What if they were to refuse to pay the tax ?
We need people who can so convincingly combine the thrifty and the substantial !
No, look around , Mrs Wemheuer , and you can see that at least the quality is here .
For it was shown that the flat-rate conversion coefficients had remained unchanged for 24 years before they were reduced to 1.37 % in 1991 .
They help people to cross linguistic barriers , and encourage the transfer of training and the exchange of students , employees and young people in Europe .
The most intensive cooperation between the educational institutions and the improvement of training systems will certainly contribute to the realization of the enormous intellectual and educational potential of Poland and the Slovak Republic , and ultimately of the citizens of the European Union .
One of the great philosophers of our century , the Dalai Lama , was once asked how he came to terms with the fact that there was still so much destruction and annihilation in the world - especially in his own country .
In this connection I would like to take issue with Mr Lukas , for I am of the opinion that he should campaign energetically in his own country for eastwards enlargement .
Of course , many adaptations can be made from the outset .
I know about these two attacks but perhaps it has also happened to many more people .
We broke into a male preserve - politics .
Where , for instance , have we ensured in the Union that we are paid the same for identical and equal work ?
Their view is limited by a guard of fabric , as if they were looking through a cage .
This will allow consumers to make price comparisons much more easily .
Hence , both the advisory committees and the main committees are proposing a hierarchy for the two-year guarantee : free repair without depreciation , if sensible and feasible , a replacement if repair proves to be neither sensible nor feasible , and should both not be possible , cancellation of contract or reduction in purchase price .
I am of the opinion that consumers have a right to expect that the statutory guarantee claims are not dependent on the country of purchase , but instead that they have the same minimum rights across the Union .
That is why I actually think this change in the right of option is crucial .
I have absolutely no sympathy with all the whining and whingeing letters we receive from industry .
And if one brings the proposed change in the burden of proof into the equation , i .e . the supposition that the fault was already present at the time of purchase , this overall arrangement represents an
