Thank you for the report .
Mr President , state aid is of course an exception to free and equal competition .
The Liberal group is delighted that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy has supported us in requiring these subsidies to be made public .
Therefore , I hope that the Commission , too , will be in a position to support the committee 's Amendments Nos 4 and 5 , in which we emphasize the requirement for making public the various subsidies , and in particular Amendment No 5 , where we urge the Commission to publish details of subsidies given to the individual countries in the Official Journal of the European Communities to ensure that the average business has access to this information .
Finally , on behalf of the Liberal group , I have to say that we cannot support Amendment No 11 , which the rapporteur touched on , and nor can we support the amendment tabled by Mr Wibe of the Socialist group .
I asked to speak because naturally enough I find it extremely dissatisfactory not to have my question answered .
My name is not Kirsten Jensen .
I would like to appeal to the administration to make this change when sending me the written response .
I find this extremely dissatisfactory and I feel the President is being inflexible here .
I would like to ask Commissioner Flynn a slightly more specific question , if he would kindly expand on the response he has already given .
A survey carried out by the School of Economics and Business Administration in Denmark shows that 50-60 % of employees in the private sector labour market have collective agreements .
The question applies equally to conditions for those in a situation where no collective agreement has been drawn up between the parties to the labour market .
The working time directive is precisely what the question is aimed at since , as the Commissioner points out , the situation is such that the Danish government has announced that a relatively large segment of private sector employees are not covered by any agreement and , thus , the working time directive is not in effect for approximately 40 % of private sector employees in the Danish labour market .
These questions are of enormous fundamental importance in Denmark , where many of us believe conditions in the labour market should be regulated by means of collective agreements , but on the other hand we do not believe that the current level of implementation can be considered adequate when the Danish government has announced that approximately 40 % of private sector employees are not included in any agreement whatsoever and are therefore simply not covered .
This is a real hot potato , because everyone has an opinion on it .
If you get five farmers in a room , there will be seven different opinions .
I think it is important to realize that we must strive towards the adoption of an OECD agreement .
I am also aware that we in Europe are working hard to achieve this .
We must remember that state aid to shipbuilding is an exception , and we must ensure that we allow the minimum acceptable level of aid , just enough to put our shipyards on an even playing field with shipyards outside Europe .
Thus , we have to examine the Commission 's proposal to see whether it fulfils this , and it does .
What really matters to the Liberal group is point 1 , namely the need for monitoring to ensure that the rules are adhered to .
Point 2 basically outlines the need for transparency with regard to where aid is being given , and reference could once again be made to the report we debated this afternoon - the Berès report - when we also touched on the question of transparency .
A third aspect is also crucial to the Liberal group and that is the question of combining the various types of aid , which actually results in a very high ceiling for support .
Thus , I would very much like us to support Amendment No 29 in order to avoid unfair competition within Europe so that shipyards will not in future be located only in areas that are eligible for regional aid .
Mr President , first of all I would like to compliment Mr Rocard and Mr Vecchi on their reports , and the Commission on its guidelines for the negotiation of the new cooperation agreements .
It is also excellent news that discussions are taking place on this agreement in the various Member States .
The needs of countries , not their geographical placement or their historical affiliations with Member States of the Union , should be the governing factor in the amount of support they receive from the EU.
This should preferably be achieved through revision of the list of countries covered by the Lomé Convention , but could if necessary be achieved by assuring countries not covered by Lomé V that they will benefit from the same conditions in relation to EU support and equal access to EU markets , regardless .
I am , of course , fully aware that the Treaty of Rome does not grant these powers , but I do appreciate the answer and would like to convey my thanks .
In your answer , you indicated that you would endeavour to do something .
I am curious to know exactly what you have in mind .
Mr President , Denmark has demonstrated that it is possible to combine efforts to secure a sound economy with efforts to reduce unemployment .
On a day such as today , we must remind one another that Economic and Monetary Union is intended to be a citizens ' project .
There is no doubt that the
