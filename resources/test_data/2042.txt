Among the aspects we criticised was that there was no guarantee - quite the reverse - that the costs of providing security measures would not be passed on to the users of these services , which are clearly public services .
The Agreement between the EC and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau for the period from June 2007 to June 2011 , provides for the granting of 37 fishing licences , four of them for Portugal .
Article 10 of the agreement also provides for the setting up of joint ventures between Community operators and Guinea-Bissau operators with a view to the joint exploitation of the resources .
The common agricultural policy always gives rise to heated debates and it is always difficult to reach consensus , but I note that we are all unanimous on the need to maintain a common agricultural policy whose objectives have just been confirmed in the Lisbon Treaty .
I hope we can retain the same spirit of compromise but be more ambitious in setting a new direction for European agriculture .
It does not acknowledge that the common agricultural policy has led to a paradoxical situation .
Incentives should be set for small and medium-sized holdings as instruments of economic and social cohesion and with a view to curbing the intensive approach and supporting associations of such farmers , including agricultural cooperatives and wine cooperatives .
We are therefore also tabling some amendments in order to stress that the common agricultural policy needs to be reviewed , taking account of this problem and strengthening aid to maintain family farms and develop the rural world , whilst attaching maximum value to the work of women , including migrant women , who also work in agriculture .
They are still allowing youth unemployment , which is reaching rates double those of overall unemployment and which affects many young people with higher education who cannot find work , and even less so work that has anything to do with their education .
The mention made of the crimes of Saddam Hussein 's regime would be acceptable if sincere and if this were not done while ignoring the current crimes and their perpetrators which have resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of displaced persons .
Given these goals , how can national referenda on the proposed Treaty be avoided ?
The Internet means that the sharing and free circulation of ideas , information and works have cast off their old physical restraints .
I therefore think that the report strikes exactly the right balance between the different points of view .
However , although we appreciate paragraph 11 , the report contains many points on which we totally disagree , for example , viewing this debate as an anticipation of the necessary modification of the existing management policy or including points that more or less explicitly argue for adopting fishing right management mechanisms at Community level .
It was for this very reason that the Ombudsman withdrew his proposal for access to the Court of Justice .
However , the compromise reached in what was not an easy debate clarifies what I think must be the inevitable conclusion on this issue : the Ombudsman , as an institution , must always be clear that , when exercising his powers , he must do so in accordance with the criteria of need , appropriateness and proportionality , because these are the criteria of justice . draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs . - ( PT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , and with regard to budget management , I would like to begin by expressing our concern at the fact that outstanding budgetary commitments have continued to rise and that this , combined with the replacement of the n+2 rule by n+3 , a change which some Member States are due to implement for the period 2007 to 2013 , might worsen the situation , with the result that funds may take longer to reach their ultimate recipients .
I consider it important to mention the timeliness of the Commission 's recommendation to Member States that they should make use of the simplifications provided for in the new Structural Funds regulations , for instance by using flat-rate amounts for indirect costs under the European Social Fund .
It is therefore an area of the utmost sensitivity and importance , which should merit special attention from the European Union , namely by means of this analysis conducted by the Dublin Agency , which may in some way help to anticipate the potential crises that we can all envisage on the horizon in any one of the 27 Member States . on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( PT ) Mr President , Vice-President of the Commission , I too would like to thank all the rapporteurs and also all my socialist colleagues , and those from other groups as well , who took part in this discharge process and who did so much to ensure it was concluded .
In the same way it is vital that Members are guaranteed the best working conditions , while still bearing in mind the need to be governed by rules of total transparency and rigour fully in line with the general rules applicable to society .
Despite containing some amendments that improve the initial proposal , the report does not move away from or denounce the creation of a worrying police cooperation framework ( including 'the establishing of joint rapid intervention groups' , enabling police forces from one Member State to operate in the territory of another ) , the creation of a ' Personal database ' ( including information on DNA , or , if 'necessary ' , on citizens ' political opinions ) and easier access to these
