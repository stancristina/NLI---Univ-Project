as well , for it is important that we do not rest on our laurels in the information and communication strategy at a time when so much is at stake concerning enlargement and the future of the EU and when we are also coming up to elections to the European Parliament .
How far have we progressed in the work on the ' Channel Europe ' concept ?
How far have we got with calculations and costs for the initiatives proposed previously ?
I know that nothing has happened in Copenhagen .
We are therefore voting in favour of enlargement today , but we would recommend that the conditions be renegotiated .
The agreement would force the candidate countries to sell agricultural land and summer houses , even though the price of land in the Netherlands is 30 times what it is in Poland .
The new countries would have to pay the full quota , while my own country , rich though it is , was given an 80 % rebate in the first year .
The majority of inhabitants of the poor countries would become net contributors , even though they are the people whom we are supposed to help .
It is a democratic scandal that the candidate countries are in no position to know what they are voting on and that the Commission devises propaganda instead of making factual information available .
There is therefore no doubt that , given the economic realities , the tradition , going back many years , of Western European exploitation of our Eastern European neighbours , in the light of the different situation where wages and capital etc . are concerned , will continue into the future .
The People 's Movement Against the EU cannot support Mr Brok 's paternalistic exposition and conclusions , but at the same time is refraining from voting against the report out of respect for the candidate countries ' right to decide for themselves - through fair and impartial referendums ( we hope for the best but fear the worst ) - whether they desire EU membership .
- ( DA ) We have chosen to vote in favour of the report because we believe it is necessary to guarantee fair treatment of third-country nationals resident lawfully .
What is more , we are aware of the fact that the proposal concerns an area that is covered by Title IV of the Treaty establishing the EC and that does not therefore apply to Denmark , cf . the Protocol on Denmark 's Position .
- ( DA ) We have chosen to fall in with our group and vote in favour of the draft resolution in Mrs Cerdeira Morterero 's report .
What we have seen , particularly in recent years and on 11 September , is that security is not brought about through building up armaments .
The military hardware it had built up did nothing to prevent that terrorist action .
There is a complete lack of proportion , both globally and in the EU , between the investments made in military hardware and our investments in genuinely sustainable security .
If , however , that identity is to consist in our copying something that has already proved to be useless and powerless , then we shall have taken a wrong turning .
The threat we are facing does not , however , come from something we can fight using military hardware .
It comes first and foremost from the desperation of people in a very unjust world , and that should instead be the focus for our priorities .
On the contrary , it is the convenience of animal owners , which is being promoted at animals ' expense .
Having a larger number of pet animals being moved around is not in the interests of animal welfare .
Fido and Kit are best off at home .
The proposal would harmonise EU regulations .
They will now , after five years , be forced to withdraw their sensible requirements .
The EU should adopt a set of minimum regulations and call upon all the EU countries to follow Sweden 's , the UK 's and Ireland 's example .
This would take the form of a proposal that puts health and animal welfare above animal owners ' freedom of movement .
It is wrong in principal to demand that EU countries with high standards in this area should relax their requirements in order to promote freedom of movement .
By voting in favour , Parliament would be adopting the principle of harmonising down to a level corresponding to the lowest common denominator , at the same time as abolishing Sweden 's , the UK 's and Ireland 's right to be pioneers .
I would call for the proposal on freedom of movement for pet animals to be voted against .
Madam President , I too think that this is a good proposal .
I am able to support the proposals concerning bans on the use of carcinogenic and other poisonous substances in detergents , and I am also able to support the supplementary proposal to the effect that the ban should include those chemicals that are difficult to break down , together with hormone-disturbing chemicals .
Where labelling is concerned , it is naturally important for us , as consumers , to be provided with information about the characteristics of substances included in detergents , including substances that cause allergies .
To a large extent , they use their own labels , and I am therefore able to support Amendment No 48 , based on the idea that , if other environmental labels are used , it must be stated in what way they differ from the EC 's official environmental label .
Finally , I would say , on the subject of animal experiments , that I am fully able to support the amendments designed to restrict animal experiments
