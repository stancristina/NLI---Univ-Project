have eleven different economic policies , for whose coordination the Member States are responsible , within the frameworks determined in the Growth and Stability Pact .
Madam President , Members of the European Parliament , I am very happy to be able to appear before you and speak for the first time in the European Parliament as Finland ' s Prime Minister .
I would like to thank the President for the views of Parliament that you presented at the European Council in Tampere , when it began its work .
The results we achieved at Tampere can , in my opinion , be regarded as successful in many regards in terms of the expectations of the public and the development of the Union .
I assured her that we would continue on a path of good cooperation with the UNHCR in the implementation of the decisions as well .
The meeting at Tampere was , for many reasons , important for the Union .
At Tampere , justice and home affairs were raised to the highest political level in cooperation with the Union .
At Tampere , the Union strengthened the basis for cooperation in justice and home affairs , of which a respect for the principles of human rights agreements , civil freedoms and rule of law are an essential part .
The European Council emphasised the consideration that asylum and immigration issues are separate , but are still close to one another .
The European Council meeting welcomed the work the high level taskforce has done to draft action plans for influencing reasons for emigration .
This work requires a wide-ranging assortment of Union foreign policy and policy on development cooperation , human rights and trade , and the prevention of conflicts .
We decided to strive towards a common European policy on the asylum system .
The principle of non-refoulement , according to which no one may be sent back into a situation where they might suffer persecution , was again reinforced separately .
With the implementation of the decisions taken at Tampere we can decisively improve the way the asylum system works , as well as standards of fairness , in Europe .
The Union must also defend its most important values against intolerance and discrimination .
This must be something that is today regarded as being very important in the European Parliament as well .
Important decisions were taken concerning the control of mass immigration .
I would like to stress here that , at the same time , we must safeguard the rights of the victims of crime and , in particular , the position of women and children .
It was also agreed at Tampere to embark on practical action that would allow us to build a European area of justice .
We similarly decided to simplify and speed up legal proceedings relating to consumer , commercial and maintenance demands of slight monetary value .
The position of the victims of crime will improve with the adoption of minimum standards for the protection of the victims of crime , especially with regard to legal protection and the right to receive damages .
I consider it an excellent achievement that the principle of mutual recognition was endorsed as a basis for both private law and criminal cases .
The European Council was unanimous in its verdict that persons and organisations that abuse freedoms and violate citizens ' rights within the territory of the Union have to be brought under better control and be held responsible for their deeds , through closer cooperation between the authorities .
The European Council called for a study into the possibility of financing a programme from Community funds , the primary focus of which would be youth , urban and drugs-related crime , which have been found to be the fastest growing areas of crime in many countries .
A top-level European taskforce would exchange experiences and aid the planning of operations together with Europol .
Europol should also be given powers to request Member States to commence , perform and coordinate investigations .
Member States , depending on their legal systems , will send state prosecutors , examining magistrates and police officers with similar powers to join this unit .
This will also be open to officials from states applying for membership .
This work will initially focus on certain forms of serious cross-border crime such as fraud , trafficking in drugs and human beings - especially the exploitation of women - the sexual abuse of children , high technology crime and environmental crime .
I especially want to raise the point that the legal authorities and centres of investigation into money-laundering will be given the right to acquire information , regardless of bank regulations or business secrecy rules , when the information is necessary to conduct an investigation into money laundering .
Europol ' s powers will be extended to money laundering in general , regardless of what type of crime the laundered funds derive from .
The targets set for cooperation in justice and home affairs can be realised only through comprehensive action .
Special attention was paid at Tampere to closer cooperation with the Balkans region .
The Commission is drafting a proposal for a scoreboard to monitor the implementation of decisions and adherence to timetables .
The most important decision taken at the European Council at Helsinki will affect the future of the whole of Europe .
At Tampere , I became increasingly convinced that Member States have a very converging opinion of how Union enlargement should be taken forward .
Finland , as the country holding the presidency , wishes to ensure that all applicant countries are encouraged and supported equally in their efforts to meet the criteria for membership .
We would like to point out to the applicant countries that the membership criteria set at Copenhagen must be met before membership is possible .
But the Union must also reform
