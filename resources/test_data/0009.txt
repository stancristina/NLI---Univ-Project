with reference to examples offered by Western countries .
The particular burden that the West bears now is the war against Yugoslavia .
In Kosovo a war of independence was going on , associated with violence against the civilian population .
If Western policy were consistent , these countries would now be considering the defence of Chechnya , even through military means , but nobody even thinks about it .
Despite our own moral burden , the European Union must use all its authority to solve the Chechen crisis according to the guidelines the representatives of the Council and the Commission have laid down here .
Mr President , the situation regarding the refugees is intolerable , and it is not Russia ' s internal affair .
However , we must remember that nobody has mentioned here that a separate Muslim state was being created between the Caspian and Black Seas .
When we cut ourselves off before , it led to Stalinism and dictatorship .
Mr President , I too would like to thank Mr Schwaiger for a balanced report .
It is an immense challenge .
The EU is promoting a solution to the challenges of Third World sustainable development and social justices .
Although the liberalisation of world trade means economic benefits and prosperity , we also have to view it critically .
The EU must have a clear idea of priorities in the talks .
That is also why the existence of the blue box , alongside the green , is essential to preserve the European model .
Mr President , what is especially gratifying about Mr Schwaiger ' s report is that it shows that Parliament has , for its part , been able to increase coherence in the aims of the talks .
Thus , for example , trade policy must be in harmony with the Union ' s policies on developing countries and the environment .
In addition , strong support for the cooperation that has begun between the ILO and the WTO promises an even better level of coherence in this area .
As a member of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , I am satisfied that we are trying to include the precautionary principle in the set of rules of the WTO .
Not only would it strengthen the legitimacy of Union action on our own turf , but the global NGO arena itself could help our negotiators to achieve the goals of the Union .
Experience shows that debate in the NGO arena easily spreads from one continent to another .
At the Seattle round , the scope and power of the WTO will grow significantly , and that is why the EU should ensure that the effects of the liberalisation of trade and the action of the WTO are continually appraised from the point of view of ecology and fairness .
Has the Council also urged the new Commission to do so ?
I gave an explanation of vote on Avilés Perea' s report on the Daphne programme , I am referred to in the Minutes as ' Herr ' Kauppi , and I would prefer it to read ' Madame ' .
The reports by Mrs Rühle and Mr Seppänen both concern the same issue : guarantees against loans granted to the European Investment Bank .
In this way the direct need for financial aid diminishes .
The Commission is proposing 60 % , but the Council has decided on a provisional rate of 65 % .
This means that if the political situation in a country in which a project is to be carried out continues as predicted , there is only a financial risk attached to lending .
That is normally the responsibility of the party granting the loan .
The percentage rate obviously has a bearing on how many loans can be guaranteed by a sum that is contained in the financial perspectives and which is at present EUR 200 million .
The rules will , however , be useless unless they are actually effective .
Examples we could mention are the drug prevention group in Finland that operates under the supervision of the National Research and Development Centre for Welfare and Health , and the Pompidou Group , a European Council cooperation group on drugs that was established in the 1970s on an initiative by the French President and that is planning several projects to reduce the supply and demand of drugs .
Now we also need a strong and clearly expressed political will to render the exchange and comparison of information as efficient as possible .
As the Finnish Minister for Trade and Industry clearly stated at the meeting , the EU , however , must not give as good as it gets when it comes to South Korea ; in other words , it must not return to the idea that it is not prepared to give up its shipyards .
For a long time now the Commission has aimed to give up shipyard aid in its present form , and this aim should absolutely be maintained .
I gladly welcome this policy , as long as it is also implemented in practice .
I would especially like to remind the Commissioner that the Union promised Finland , when we were negotiating membership , that it would take account of our remoteness and climate when deciding its aims for navigation policy for the whole continent .
There is broad national consensus on the issue in the Finnish Parliament , as shown by the fact that , exceptionally , on its own initiative , the parliament increased powers to solicit acquisitions in the 1999 budget .
This is also what was stated in the Commission ' s letter of 4 August 1999 by officials in Directorate-General VII when they pointed out that the aid had no connection with shipyards in the EU.
