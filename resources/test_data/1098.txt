too is a positive message .
The Court of Auditors can then verify subsequently whether the technique is sound .
We , as the Liberal Group , have tabled an amendment which extends the period which lapses before it becomes final from 24 to 36 months .
We think that an agreement must be concluded between the Commission , Parliament and the Council about a new interinstitutional accord , thus allowing the expenses made by the Council in this respect to be better monitored .
Coordination between the Commission and the Member States is well below par .
I trust that the Commissioner will now have some insight into the results achieved over the course of 2001 .
We are not keen on a dual-track policy involving competing bodies .
This is a key point for us too .
Why ?
Hopefully it will be possible to deploy this force for the first time in Macedonia .
Recently , striking discrepancies between the European Union and the US have come to light .
Such policy is inherently multilateral and also explains why we react to Sharon 's military approach with such horror .
A kind of artificial distribution of tasks has taken place between the European Union and the United States .
Decisive foreign policy cannot only be based on economic clout and generosity with euros .
In any event , Europe will remain autonomous in its decision-making .
The civil aspects of security - the Commissioner was right to make reference to this - have once again secured victory for the European Union in Macedonia .
My final remark concerns the importance of common European plans where defence investments are concerned .
Two separate resolutions may be before us , but the link that is being sustained between them is an artificial one .
To this day , the Council has failed to come up with a unanimous answer .
Mr President , it has often been said that the European Union is a kind of economic giant , but a military and political dwarf .
Mention is being made of Macedonia and a specific role for the European Union , specifically in Bosnia .
In my view , we must continue to drive the message home .
It is legitimate that the Sharon administration , albeit only after numerous , extremely bloody Palestinian suicide attacks , has finally eliminated the Palestinian terrorist networks of its own accord .
The violence must end and must make way for lasting peace .
The proclamation of an arms embargo is not sufficient .
This is the objective of the directive on which we are currently working .
A third point is the black box , which was already mentioned in the report by Mr Watts .
In my opinion , we have stated this clearly in Parliament and this is very important point .
The European Parliament , or , as far as I am concerned , the rapporteurs of these various reports , must , together with the Commission , check at regular intervals what has happened , how far we have got and what the problems are we are facing .
European industry has itself indicated that it will not be using the European patent if it turns out to be too costly .
Indeed , following on from the Council 's position , the rapporteur suggests applying the procedure , the working method , of the Trademarks Bureau to the Community patent .
Since as long ago as 1958 , the citizens of the Member States have had the right to use their own official language in their communication with the European institutions , and also when they communicate before legal bodies of the Community .
Thank you , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen .
If we wish to implement the principle of responsibility and of 'the polluter pays ' to the letter , then we will need to ensure that manufacturers bear their share of these costs .
Mr President , on a final note , I should like to support you and the rapporteur in the fact that we are holding this debate far too late in the evening , and that attendance is disappointingly low .
Nearly the whole of Parliament will be voting in favour of individual producer responsibility tomorrow .
Electrolux in Sweden deserves credit in this respect .
If they stop using dangerous substances , they will not need to pick up the bill for disposing of these later on .
Thank you , Mr President .
For reasons of safety , I am in favour of the use of lead in television tubes .
Finally , I should like to ask the European Commission , namely Mrs Wallstr√∂m , when she will be reviewing the batteries directive .
The European Commission 's argument has always been that this review proposal could become a reality as soon as the proposal for a directive on electronic waste has been drafted .
However , individual funding is not the answer .
Visibility would certainly enhance awareness on the part of the consumer , and this is of major importance , as consumer cooperation is crucial if we are to achieve the environmental objectives .
In this vein , I support the appeal made by human rights organisations to invite Mr Mascadov to Parliament in Strasbourg in September of this year and to start consultations with the Russian representatives of the Council of Europe .
We can hardly label these organisations , these people who are mentioned in our compromise resolution , as agents of international terrorism , as representatives of Bin Laden .
Can I make a suggestion to you , Mr Nielsen ?
Nevertheless , I take the view that it is very important , particularly in a situation as complicated as this one , where it is important to help find a solution , to keep a cool head , even though we have a warm heart .
