What to do with this enormous debt that has built up by granting credit without guarantees ?
This will facilitate the free and unimpeded movement , establishment and employment of citizens in Member States in order to provide better , more efficient and more easily accessible services to citizens and public administrations .
The figure could amount to EUR 500 million , as Commission Vice-President Antonio Tajani told the press .
It is a tragedy : 50 000 evacuees , thousands of houses destroyed , hundreds of public buildings devastated , including schools , and a prestigious cultural , architectural and artistic heritage in ruins .
Fifthly , we must investigate with the Commission the possibility of tax breaks for the economic activities and construction work which should , we all hope , pick up again in the Abruzzo region .
Even those who did not travel there have done something : economically , culturally , our country 's entire cultural , social and economic spheres are being mobilised , which is very important .
As the Commission itself today confirmed , first of all we must verify all available financial resources , guarantee the swift activation of the European Solidarity Fund for natural disasters , and then look at the possibility of making full use of and reprogramming the European Social Fund and other Community programmes to support employment and businesses .
However , we are calling in particular for the possibility of introducing extraordinary legislative measures , tax breaks , incentives and aid possibly as an exception to current de minimis provisions .
In addition to this , we need a land policy that provides guaranteed standards on land use that respect its balance , as well as safe building standards .
I would like to take a quick look at the reports we are debating , in order to give some answers to the questions asked by the rapporteurs .
This statement will also be published in the Official Journal , alongside the legislative proposal .
In an increasingly open market , we need to harmonise the conditions imposed on the companies that compete in this market .
That is why I said at the beginning of my speech that the laws about to be passed by this House make a serious and important contribution to our joint battle , as Commission and Parliament , to reduce drastically the number of road traffic casualties .
It is my belief , however , that this legislation , as it is to be adopted , will not - as I said earlier - have any negative repercussions for existing agreements .
I believe , perhaps because I was born in Rome , that the history of Roman law and the Napoleonic Code has demonstrated the importance of having rules that guarantee society 's development .
We now come to the amendments before Parliament , and I would like to thank my fellow Members for the important contributions they have made to the text of the regulation and for their excellent cooperation .
I therefore wish the Czech Presidency and Sweden , the next country to hold the presidency of the European Council , success in their work on passenger rights and , of course , I hope to be able to contribute to the subsequent phases of the adoption of this regulation during the next parliamentary term .
So , I think that today we are discussing topics that affect the lives of all citizens , which is why I am persuaded that as far as the bus and coach proposal is concerned , support should be given - and the meeting of the Committee on Transport and Tourism of 30 March showed encouraging signs of this - to the Commission 's approach for the widest possible scope , covering all regular passenger transport services whether international , national , regional , urban or suburban .
Thirdly , this area concerns neither imports nor the procedures set out in the 2005 directive on insurance against civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles ; and fourthly , the Commission has not in fact developed a new liability model .
I am pleased to have had the opportunity to observe from this debate a certain amount of dovetailing between the Commission , Member States and Parliament as regards the aim of giving European passengers a new and ambitious regulation as soon as possible .
As has emerged over the course of the debate , there are no differences of substance between the members of the various political groups ; everyone has emphasised , in agreement with the Commission and also the Council , a desire to truly build , as Vice-President Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou said , a Europe of citizens .
This is a particularly warm thank-you , because I believe that today the European institutions as a whole are showing that they pay close attention to the 500 million European citizens , who can sometimes be suspicious of them ; but I think that today those who have followed this debate will change their minds and have confidence in the European institutions , which seek to be ever closer to the people .
Copyright protection currently lasts for a maximum of 50 years , and in my opinion this period is not sufficient to give fair remuneration to artists for their creative work and performance .
Indeed , it is important to improve the social situation of artists through greater protection , provided by the institutions .
After the debate we have had today and having read Mr Savary 's text , we want to carry on down this route .
I am , of course , pleased with the choices made and take note of the suggested amendments to the draft directive .
In 2001 , the Commission recommended that Member States publish detailed information on road types within the network and on restricted traffic
