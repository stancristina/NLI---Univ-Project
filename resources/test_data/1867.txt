The Lisbon process requires a move from words to action .
What decisions will you produce in the next six months to achieve increased competitiveness in Europe ?
I believe that the Swedes have an excellent opportunity to show some leadership .
With this in mind , the presidency could establish a modern agenda to enable the EU to live up to its proud aims .
She introduced important elements into the discussion on growth , including the significance of trade .
In its communication , the Commission takes up the need for simplification of regulations in the EU.
A good economy is a prerequisite for welfare .
These principles for Europe ' s aim to be a word leader in terms of economic development and growth are necessary in parallel with the development of an ambitious social dimension ; this is the whole point .
On the other hand , certain GUE politicians are now entering this current debate and attacking the Bullmann report for focusing too much on deregulation and competition .
These must address both deregulation and liberalisation to a certain extent , as well as common aims for dealing with the problems of unemployment and social exclusion .
It is therefore necessary to adapt the scope of Regulation ( EEC ) No 1408/71 with regard to harmonisation of social security systems .
In 1998 , before the European Council in Tampere , the Council received a proposal from the Commission aimed at expanding Regulation No 1408/71 to cover third-country nationals .
This proposal also advocates the regulation being expanded to cover third-country nationals .
The Council is currently giving the proposal its first reading .
The technical review currently underway will help us to establish difficulties which may arise from an expansion of the scope of Regulation No 1408/71 .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I have listened to this debate with great interest .
This is technically a complicated issue and it has been necessary to take the time to test the Council ' s reactions and to provide the Council and the Commission with the opportunity to consider , reflect and create a foundation for future negotiations .
We believe this is extremely important .
Let me finally say the following in answer to Mrs van Lancker ' s question on what the Swedish Presidency intends or would like to do to tackle the problems of discrimination .
In addition , in the conclusions from the European Council in Helsinki , and recently in the Military Capabilities Commitment Declaration , which was presented after the conference held in France in November 2000 and which accompanied the presidency ' s report to the summit in Nice , it was emphasised that 'the Union recognises the primary responsibility of the United Nations Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security . '
Instead , we received a report on the fact that the EU will act in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter .
Is it the case that the EU needs a UN mandate to intervene with its planned rapid reaction force , i .e . a positive decision from the UN ?
I once again refer to the 'capacity declaration ' .
We also know that in a number of Member States , depending to some extent upon national tradition , various forms of reference to the UN Charter are required for the country to take part in an intervention .
As such , it is a case of belt and braces regarding this issue .
It is not about spirit or other higher values .
I would like to be given a yes or no answer .
However , I realise that this is not sufficient for Mr Sj√∂stedt and Mr Schmid , for which I am sorry .
Scandal or not , I can only assume that there is a fundamental difference of opinion .
There is major support for this view .
The work is quite complicated both in the civil and the military spheres as the EU is creating new resources and structures .
In addition , the Swedish Presidency has clarified the fact that it is appropriate , as the EU' s civil crisis management continues to develop , also to establish other areas within the framework of civil crisis management in which EU resources may need to be developed or used more effectively .
Moreover , the monitoring mission recently showed its value when it was deployed in Presevo Valley .
Mr Danielsson appears to be trying to incorporate an old Swedish expression into general EU jargon - you see , I do not think there is a good translation of 'goddag yxskaft ' [literally 'hello , axe handle ' ] .
I did not ask about police and a host of other pleasant or less pleasant , friendly or less friendly measures for civil crisis management .
It is very easy to answer yes or no .
I understand that my long reply was somewhat too comprehensive for Mr Gahrton .
Turkey was accepted as an applicant country at the European Council in Helsinki in December 1999 .
It contains arrangements for the EU' s military crisis management which enable consultation with , and participation of , European NATO members which are not members of the EU and other countries which are candidates for accession to the EU.
It is not that common - particularly in our home country Sweden - to emphasise this link between the EU and NATO .
I also know that these issues are being discussed in all Member States .
Does the presidency have any views on the appropriateness of this ?
Generally speaking , we all know the importance that not only Parliament but also the Council attach to obtaining full clarification as quickly as possible of environmental and other problems which may arise due to depleted uranium .
I will be brief .
I am convinced that the end
