have mentioned are also quite important because they reflect remarkably on four current Commissioners .
All four of them must look carefully at their past , come clean and show this new Commission where reform is needed .
I hope that Commissioner Kinnock listens to this debate and will reflect upon .
There are lessons to be learned and many questions to be answered and he is the man in charge of getting these questions answered for us now .
I also wish to make a couple of points on the Kuhne report on Parliament 's own budget discharge .
We regularly cast stones at the Commission , but when it comes to looking at our own finances sometimes we are a bit slow on the uptake .
Although we have recommended discharge for our own budget this time , there are a number of points in the discharge report we should look at , especially the inventory services and the new system .
I welcome the fact that the Kuhne report has called for a report on the new inventory system for Parliament .
I hope the Commission takes the time to look at this debate seriously .
This Parliament is very serious in the way it discharges various budgets .
I agree with Mrs Morgan that maybe we need to reflect on how we discharge budgets in the future .
However , for now , the Commission has a number of questions to answer and I hope it will start right now .
Madam President , I wish to add my warm welcome and congratulations to the presidency on the successful achievement of the Lisbon Summit .
I think we will come to see in the future that all roads did lead to Lisbon via Luxembourg , Cardiff and Cologne , because Lisbon should be the end of a process , one that can actually deliver as regards the sort of priorities we want to bring to a successful conclusion throughout the whole of the European Union .
The key question is how we turn the conclusions of the Lisbon Summit into action ; we must ensure that we turn the rhetoric of Lisbon into a reality .
I shall not dwell too much on the specifics of the Lisbon Summit .
A lot of us have been through that already and we welcome many of the conclusions .
I want to look at the challenges that are inherent in the Lisbon process for Parliament , the Commission and , indeed , all three institutions .
In particular , for Parliament there is a huge challenge in realising the full legislative implications of completing a single market .
There is a challenge in realising the full potential of the e-economy .
There is a challenge for Parliament in playing its part in helping Europe to become the dynamic centre of sustainable job creation , innovation , competitiveness and modernised social welfare .
It is a challenge that Parliament must rise to , working with the other institutions , Commissioner Prodi and his colleagues , and the Council .
If we do not , nobody will understand or forgive us for not realising our aim .
The reason , as I mentioned before the Lisbon Summit , relates to those who are in the gallery with us today - the citizens of Europe .
We have to turn Lisbon into something that means something to them , something to the people in my home town of Wolverhampton .
To me , Lisbon is all about creating a Europe of highly-paid , highly-skilled , high-value-added jobs .
If we can achieve that sort of Europe from the Lisbon process , it will be good for our citizens and for Europe as a whole , because what could be more socially just and inclusive than a Europe that genuinely benefits from full employment and good jobs that everybody can enjoy ?
That is our challenge .
In conclusion , I thank the Portuguese presidency very much .
I thank the President-in-Office , the Minister and , in particular , Prime Minister Guterres for all the personal effort he put into this process .
At Lisbon the Portuguese presidency gave us the key to unlock a decade of sustained innovation , competitiveness and job creation across our continent .
Now is the time for us as a Parliament , the Commission and the Council to work together to ensure that key is turned .
Mr President , I decided to speak in this debate when I read the truly excellent analysis of the current situation in Europe produced by the European Commission before the Lisbon Summit .
It is true that the Lisbon Summit also represented something of a sea-change in attitudes towards the global society and in particular towards issues like e-commerce .
At the same time there was a tension in Lisbon between the old world of the international socialists and the new world of those who have a slightly wider perspective .
So the city of Henry the Navigator may become the city of Netscape the navigator , a new approach which I thoroughly welcome .
The summit was variously described as a social summit and an e-summit and so on .
Much was said about the economic and social policies that were supposed to emanate from Lisbon .
The reality is that the European social model is now living in London and she is called Laetitia Casta .
She is Marianne , the symbol of France but taxes in France are now so high that she now has to go and live in London despite the vastly increased taxation under Labour .
Very soon now the government is about to raise GBP 16 billion through the sale of the third generation mobile telephone licences as Mr Suominen reminded us .
There is tension around Europe but at the same time I detect a sea-change .
