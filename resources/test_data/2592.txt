report - and also for putting up with my being such a thorn in his side !
He mentioned earlier that the report was carried with a significant majority but not with my support .
So although I may not share his conclusions , I believe he has illustrated in his report many of the issues which the Commission must address .
The first is the potential for renationalisation of competition policy .
I know that the Commission is set against this , but the potential exists .
I remain worried about the capacity of national courts and the capacity of the national competition authorities .
I remain worried about the whole operation of the judicial process .
I asked Commissioner Monti the other day what happens if he proves to be wrong and there is an effective renationalisation .
Mr von Wogau said we can look to the European Court .
Well , we in Britain are looking to the European Court at the moment .
We find that the European Court is not able to provide us with interim measures in a certain dispute that we have with France at the moment , in which we have the support of the Commission .
Unless anybody thinks that this is merely a nationalistic point , in the Factortame case , in which the British Government was the defendant , it took ten years for the European Court to give a ruling .
So , judicially , something needs to be done .
I ask the Commission what can be done to speed up implementation in this particular area .
In relation to legal certainty , I endorse the point made by Mrs Thyssen .
It is important that business has legal certainty .
I mentioned this again to Commissioner Monti recently .
He said we must not always be carried along by lawyers .
I must declare an interest as a lawyer but also as a former competition minister in the United Kingdom .
We all have , as it were , our histories to live with , but it is important that business has legal certainty .
I would also ask the Commission whether an analysis has been undertaken of the implications of this change for business : a cost-benefit analysis of the sort that is now becoming so much more European policy .
I know there has been an analysis of the implications for the Commission of the change .
We have been told how , currently , people 's time is being wasted and that the changes , therefore , could be beneficial .
But I really feel that , in the circumstances , we want to know what the implications would be for business .
Finally , we , as British Conservatives , are looking for a change in direction , towards the development of an independent competition authority .
I would like to hear what Commissioner Monti has to say about that .
Mr President , I am very glad that Mrs Randzio-Plath mentioned the very important context of our debate because up until now no other speaker has done so .
The advent of the euro at the beginning of last year unleashed enormous competitive forces within European business which are being met by a merger wave of quite unprecedented proportions .
For example , the figures for last year now show that the total value of mergers in the European area was EUR 1.4 trillion , which is seven times the level of merger activity at the peak of the last European merger boom in 1990 .
This poses enormous challenges for competition policy , which I hope it will be able to meet because , for certain , many of those mergers are going to be designed to protect profit margins of the businesses from competition rather than merely to enhance productivity and make those businesses able to operate on a bigger scale .
Commissioner Monti and his colleagues have a tremendous challenge ahead of them and our worries in the ELDR Group are that there should be no weakening in the thrust of competition policy either in the examination of mergers or the monitoring of restrictive practices .
Delegation to national authorities is all very well but we would emphasise what Mr von Wogau said in his report on the need for regular monitoring of national authorities to ensure that there is no slippage in the European element , and , particularly would ask the Commissioner to reassure us that there would be random checks on that .
Mr President , ever since I was elected to this Parliament in 1994 I have never witnessed a report which had such anti-Irish sentiments and overtones as the Jonckheer report which we are debating today .
I would like to quote verbatim from the report : " State aid per capita is highest in Italy , Germany and Ireland .
Ireland clearly is in the lead when national and Community regional and social funds are put together . "
I believe that the rapporteur is simply playing with figures .
I find it difficult to understand how he can index regional and social funds into this mathematical equation .
I should like to remind the Member that the European Union has agreed to the new regional aid guidelines for the period 2000 plus .
This was merely an extension of the policy objectives to complete the internal market within Europe .
Regional disparities must be overcome if the internal market is to succeed and prosper .
I welcome the fact that grant aid of 40 % and a top-up of 15 % for SMEs for fixed investment will be permitted for companies setting up in Objective 1 regions in Europe post-2000 .
I remind Mr Jonckheer that Irish companies or foreign companies in Ireland still have to cross two sea masses to reach the mainland European marketplace .
No other Member State is at such a disadvantage .
