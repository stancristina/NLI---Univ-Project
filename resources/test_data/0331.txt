Thirdly , I am against a minimum income without contributing in return , except for people who are unfit for work .
We are very pleased about this progress .
Together we have framed a vision for our work - a precise definition of the overarching challenges of our time .
At the recent MDG summit meeting , that is precisely what we agreed .
Here , too , Europe 's vision and voice have been central .
There is still a wide gap of trust between the developing and the developed world .
This is the third global challenge that I wish to bring to you today .
But for Europe , 'winning the peace ' was the narrative of the last century .
A Union in which all children , whatever the origin of their parents , have the same chance of success .
Once again , Parliament has been asked to validate payment of aid from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to employees made redundant as a result of the crisis or relocations .
I support the report on precarious women workers because I cannot conceive that in the 21st century , major differences persist in relation to women in the European Union with regard to employment opportunities , quality of work , income and equal pay for equal work or work of equal value .
Nonetheless , I shall take this opportunity to tell you about some preliminary reactions and also to remind you of the Council 's concerns in the context of this 2011 budget procedure .
As regards payment appropriations , I would like to convey to you the Council 's concern as to the actual absorption capacities under heading 1b , in relation to cohesion for growth and competitiveness .
It will obviously not behave otherwise in the context of this discussion .
Firstly , the financing of agencies .
The fact remains that , for the moment , we have a parliamentary position , and having heard what Mr Wathelet had to say about the Council 's views , I obviously have some concerns about what awaits us in conciliation .
He called on us Europeans to be pioneers in the field of renewable energies , to strongly promote new types of energy and not those of the past , not those that earn money first and foremost for shareholders but fail to help European consumers or future generations of Europeans , who are going to have to continue to manage the issue of waste .
I hope that , by ensuring that we have this global debate , we shall be able to show that the 2011 budget , on the basis of this new Lisbon procedure , will be a success , and I simply remind you that if we fail to reach an agreement on the 2011 budget , the perspectives for additional spending for 2011 will be even smaller and will not match what the Council is proposing today .
It is not necessarily a question of asking for more money but rather to ensure that the tasks assigned to the European Union can be achieved with adequate funding .
That is the question .
What do we need to do in order to have own resources tomorrow for Europe , or rather for all the citizens of Europe , so that we are all put back on the path to growth and on an even firmer path for the Europe of tomorrow to take ?
In a democracy , one thing is necessary : that the people pay their individual revenue directly to Europe and that they can therefore contribute and control the functioning of the European Union through those resources .
Ladies and gentlemen , it is an understatement to say that we have encountered and are still facing an unprecedented financial crisis that is not over yet .
The Basel III regulations were drawn up in the Basel Committee by experts from the regulatory and supervisory authorities of the 27 major international banking markets , with the Commission 's very active participation on behalf of all Member States of the European Union .
Furthermore , this problem has been exacerbated due to a lack of understanding of the financial robustness of other institutions .
Subject : EU-Africa summit/food security In connection with World Food Day on 16 October 2009 , the FAO has recently indicated that the situation remains unsatisfactory despite a slight improvement regarding the number of those suffering from chronic hunger in the world (925 million this year , compared with 1.023 billion in 2009 ) .
One important matter concerning the future distribution of direct support among Member States will be to determine how to progress from the current situation to a more equitable distribution in the future and , at the same time , avoid major upheavals which could have significant economic consequences in certain regions or for certain production systems .
This is a system we wish to abandon and replace with objective criteria .
Are any improvements noticeable ?
In the case of the common agricultural policy , supporting the diversity of production systems and direct contact between farmers , producers and consumers is another way for farmers , through the products that they sell , to better communicate all the conditions with which they have to comply .
It is important to underline that , in line with the principle of subsidiarity , it is the Member States which propose the content of measures under the rural development programme , in accordance with the Rural Development Regulation .
However we have not , thus far , received such a proposal for the agricultural sector .
I am especially pleased to see that private companies and public authorities are now placed on an equal footing .
After all
