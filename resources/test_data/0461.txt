enact the tobacco advertising ban .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Tindemans for this excellent report .
The European Union has a clear angle on security , regardless of whether there are elements of military security in future Union operations .
We should remember that European integration is , by its nature , its aims and its fundamental structure , one vast security project , with defence as one of the principles of the Maastricht Treaty .
Although it might be claimed that the interests of the eastern European countries in NATO membership are ultimately focused on military security , it must also be said that when the countries of central and eastern Europe join , the organization 's role as one of regional , collective security will grow .
If it is the specific task of the WEU to implement military operations in the future , the role of the supervisory members in active participation will be hopelessly vague .
I see that in the near future all those concerned , including my country , Finland , must be part of the WEU operation , as a result of equal and fully-fledged membership .
The Petersberg tasks , which were written into the Amsterdam Treaty on the initiative of Finland and Sweden , and which allow all Union Member States to participate in regional peacekeeping operations , will create a supporting structure for a single defence policy .
Mr Tindemans and Mr Titley wish to manufacture weapons a long way from the front for those who will have to fight there whenever , according to the report , the basic principles of the EU are made a laughing stock of .
How many of you can say the same , you who are now planning a common arms industry , a common arms capacity and a common military doctrine ?
If it comes to the crunch , will you homefront arms manufacturers be offering to help out those who are joined with you in a union , but against their own wishes , get involved in armed conflict ?
You are too poor a bunch of soldiers to give others guidance on security .
Madam President , there are three reasons why I cannot agree with the basic tenets of Mr Tindemans ' s report .
Conflicts , particularly those in Europe , require improved methods of stabilizing crises and improved peacekeeping operations .
This sort of cooperation is required , for example , in the development of the Baltic region and in the Nordic sea regions .
Thirdly , the notion of developing the European Union as a defence organization does little to aid EU enlargement .
On the other hand , as has been mentioned , one improvement to the Amsterdam Treaty was realized on the initiative of Sweden and Finland , namely the inclusion of the Petersberg tasks .
That applies to big Member States as well as small ones , as was shown in the mishandling of the Yugoslav crisis .
Portugal might view this differently .
Decisions on European defence policy should not be made in Washington , as has happened in the past .
If the Socialist proposals for amendments fall , many of us will have to vote against the entire report .
European industry still represents production processes , professional skill and experience at the highest level .
For this reason , we must pay special attention to the development of training schemes , support for teachers and creating an innovative environment .
Europe will not be competitive as long as it is struggling with the problem of unemployment , which is a waste of human resources .
Europe 's strength lies in the diversity of its peoples and cultures .
These are the basis of a sustainable information society .
They should be simultaneously both local and global .
The Commission should put forward a proposal to create a framework for a new European industrial policy .
Similarly , the burden of taxation has to shift from the shoulders of the workforce to such areas as , for example , speculative currency dealing .
The growth of electronic commerce is giving rise to many complex questions .
The Commission should not delay in addressing problems of copyright , trademarks , misleading advertising and safeguarding personal data .
Things could go the way they have in my country : electronic banking has lost half the jobs in the banking sector .
When we talk of freedom of choice in commerce , the choice should also take employees into consideration : a choice between work and unemployment .
New jobs are certainly being created , but the old ones are disappearing rapidly .
Rationalization that gets rid of jobs is easy .
We have to create new forms of transaction , because , for example , there does not appear to be any upper limit to spending , as there is , for example , to consuming .
The right equipment and a connection to the Internet should therefore become every citizen 's right .
Mr President , I would also like to thank Mr Herman for an excellent report .
The immense new challenges of the European integration process , such as the eastwards enlargement of the Union and the single currency , will require a lot of time for the formulation of opinions .
An examination of the institutions is essential in this regard .
Nevertheless , there is still only the vaguest reference to ordinary citizens when legitimizing so-called major projects .
The media followed the EMU debate in the European Parliament unusually closely that weekend , because that was the only institution that was discussing the matter with the doors open .
The fateful and foolish decision of the Amsterdam Conference in favour of common democratic surveillance and reform of the institutions will inevitably have an effect on the timetable for enlargement
