I do not have the impression that negotiations have reached deadlock per se .
Nonetheless we must remain objective .
The Council forums regularly examine the ratification situation and try to make it clear to delegations that it is absolutely essential that the decisions be rapidly enforced .
Then of course we come to the questions concerning the democratic deficit within the European Union , about which the European Parliament does in fact have a number of issues to which it regularly returns .
The Council wishes to point out that the concern expressed by the European Parliament is at the top of the agenda .
However , the careful implementation of such mechanisms is a complicated process in which the balance in the Europol system must be carefully monitored .
I must say at this juncture that the Council is applying the institutional convention provisions to the letter .
This having been said , the Council knows that the European Union ' s standpoints have a specific value added which differs from those of the Member States .
Thus the European arrest warrant has also come into being as far as cooperation in judicial matters and mutual recognition in criminal matters are concerned .
The European Parliament has rightly been pressing for a strict definition , and has been knocking the eagerness to label all dissidents as terrorists on the head .
This is because better coordination between Member States overcomes the problem described to a large extent .
Mr President , the European arrest warrant was saved in the nick of time .
However , it will require a Treaty change and sufficient political will to do this , but we cannot wait that long .
Tomorrow , and by that I mean the day after tomorrow , I hope that at the Laeken Summit we will give new impetus to the Amsterdam resolutions and the Tampere recommendations that have not yet been implemented .
( NL ) Without democratic regulation by the state , health becomes a commodity .
However , it is necessary that the amendments rejected after the first reading get a comfortable majority today , so that we can clearly establish that health is not a commodity and is not subject to financial compromises , and that there is a great deal to be improved in the area of healthcare in many Member States , which has been neglected for the past twelve years .
However , whilst we wish to keep a balance , let us not forget that this is not a struggle between two equal parties .
The fact is that the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the EU Member States are placing political responsibility for the ongoing Palestinian suicide attacks on Israeli citizens where it belongs : with the Palestinian Authority .
Madam President , my group is deeply shocked by the violence that has once again flared up in the Middle East .
European projects have been destroyed in Israeli attacks ; Commissioner Patten himself has already mentioned the forensic laboratory .
I do not think that it is helpful to try to accuse the Council of favouring one side over the other .
Where are we now , one week on from 3 December ?
However , Article 6 states that if Member States make comments about European legislation with regard to the Council or the Coreper in individual notes or letters , these do not have to be published .
I cannot find it .
Nothing has been published about these either .
We had a nice compromise , the best result we could have achieved this spring , a reasonable improvement on the Commission ' s original proposals and the existing Rules of Procedure .
But then I look at the Council and I notice that the documents relating to the Justice and Home Affairs Council have not yet been released , or that not all documents have been included in the register .
Mr President , Commissioner , I will limit myself to answering the questions that have been asked , the question from the rapporteur , Mrs Maij-Weggen , as to whether the new decisions overrule the so-called Solana decisions ; the answer is yes , they do .
This is not the case ; this is not my philosophy ; it may be yours , but I do not share it .
This framework should encompass , inter alia , the list of the issues to be discussed , as well as give indications as to how these issues could be tackled most effectively .
As I have already said , these are matters to be dealt with by the European Council of Laeken .
Madrid is a difficult customer in this regional issue .
Consequently , I am unable to answer your question in the light of this lack of knowledge .
We hope that you have been able to adhere to that position after that tour of the various capital cities .
The times may have changed , but we used to think differently about this .
The reply I received from a State Minister of the Indian State of Andarpradesh to my question how many people lived in that province , will always stay with me .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , during the part-session of 19 and 20 September , the Council took note of the European Parliament resolution on the progress made on the implementation of the common foreign and security policy , and agreed to consider this resolution within the framework of the discussion of the different points it contains .
The Council is acutely aware of the great sensitivity surrounding this dossier and of the need for observing strict neutrality .
The specific aim of these measures is to combat
