I should like to thank Mr Barroso and Mr Verheugen for their personal support in this matter , and I should also like to thank the President of the European Council , Mr Schüssel , who has offered his personal support in relation to a matter that was initially dropped by the Council of Ministers when Austria took over the Presidency .
There are also , in fact , reasons for thanking ourselves here in this Chamber , because we voted in favour of the much discussed Amendment 45 , which made the victory possible .
Three hundred and sixty-seven votes are needed if we elected representatives are to have real influence , and we obtained 370 .
I also wish especially to congratulate those responsible for now creating a clear precedent for our being able to introduce minimal rules , even when the legal base is the internal market’s provisions .
I hope that this will not be an isolated development but , on the contrary , will herald a new direction for European cooperation .
In this way , everyone will sense that progress has been made .
Mr Verheugen , Mr Dimas and Mr Barroso would be uncomprehending , too .
We representatives of the people have made a difference , and we can be proud of our joint efforts .
The next task must , of course , be that of convincing all the countries that there are technical alternatives , so that we might obtain a common EU ban on fluorinated gases , preferably before 2012 when the Kyoto Agreement is to be renewed in a spirit of consideration for future generations .
I hope that Mr Barroso and Mr Verheugen will firmly resist those who are trying to drag them down into the mud .     Mr President , I had actually intended to make a different speech but , having heard the debate in this House , I must thank Mrs Doyle for her splendid contribution .
There is nothing about countries being able to go further and no assurance of Denmark being able to go further .
There are no reassuring signals .
There is , in fact , such a thing as substitution .
We have efficient refrigerators in Denmark and Austria , yet the choice has been made to defer to the fluorinated gases industry instead of to the environment .
It is therefore exclusively Mrs Doyle whom I shall thank for her splendid but , it has to be said , entirely fruitless efforts .     Mr President , the situation in Palestine is very tense .
Now they are isolated behind Israel’s dividing wall , with no ability to create a healthy economy for themselves .
The only people to gain from what is now happening are the extremists .
There is , in actual fact , an imminent danger of everything exploding .
It became clear that they recognise the pre-1967 borders and , therefore , Israel .
Hamas has not set its face against the PLO sticking to the negotiating policy it has adopted .
That is not , however , what we are doing .
The EU’s and the United States’s double standard is all too apparent .
Why should they not respect the ruling given by the Court of Justice in The Hague and remove the illegal wall ?
In defiance of the so-called roadmap etc , they are now putting up buildings in E1 .
Why should they not pay the Palestinians ’ own money back , that is to say all the money that they are illegally withholding ?
Mr Solana has said that they ought to do so .
They are not doing so , however , and absolutely nothing is happening .
When we meet the Palestinians , it is , however , impossible to explain the double standard we have got used to exercising in relation to Israel .
It is not our money dealings but our unsustainable double standard that is the problem .     – Mr President , I should also like to begin by endorsing what Mr Stubb said .
I have to say – with a touch of black humour that nonetheless contains a grain of truth – that , on this particular occasion , it is perhaps just as well that people outside our building are not interested in what we are doing , as we should be a laughing stock , I believe , if anyone could actually see to what we were giving priority on the agenda in preference to this extremely important matter .
I think that the whole process has been helpful and constructive .
The discharge procedure is an extremely important one .
I also wish to endorse his recommendation that we naturally grant the Commission discharge .
Obviously , it must be accompanied by a number of observations because , this year too , the basic issue of our dissatisfaction arises .
There are unfortunately too many areas in which we still cannot give satisfactory assurances that European taxpayers ’ money is being properly administered .
There are a number of areas in which progress is being made .
Praise is obviously in order .
That is something else about which we should , of course , be pleased .
What is at issue here are the Commission ’s working parties and the many committees that come under the umbrella of the Commission .
On this point , I am very pleased with the assurances I see the Commissioners as having given today .     – Mr President , I should firstly like to thank my fellow Member , Mr Mulder , for all the painstaking work he has done , as well as thank the other rapporteurs .
It is , of course , regrettable that , this year again , we do not have a straightforward statement of assurance .
As is well known , the EU should ideally be a model for the Member States , especially for the new countries with new and
