Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the previous speaker spoke with a great deal of passion , and I have to say that I agree with him .
The fact is that , internationally , the price competition is absolutely ruthless .
This completely stymies our dumping policy , since the WTO insists that complaints about dumping must be based on official trade statistics .
The combating of unemployment must be the top priority of any presidency .
I urge the Irish presidency to get this matter sorted out at last .
The Dutch are right to point to the relative attractiveness of their policy in terms of addict numbers and drug-related deaths .
Europe was not prepared to bring peace to Bosnia .
Nor have those of the USA .
Past Irish presidencies have always been good and effective ones .
We want use of the veto to be kept to an absolute minimum and we want Parliament 's joint legislative powers to be respected and extended , in respect both of legislation and of the budget .
And then there is Yugoslavia , Madam President .
We have every confidence that it will be a successful one .
We currently waste millions ' worth .
I think it also provides evidence to support the European Parliament 's view that the criteria for EMU are more flexible than the ECOFIN ministers would often have us believe .
It is the EU 's fervent hope that working together with the US , we shall get true democracy and human rights restored to Cuba .
By its very existence , however , the Act has already done great damage to the more than 150 firms which feature in what the Americans so graphically call Cuba 's ' Hall of Shame ' .
So with an eye to the future , Mr President-inOffice , the EU 's reaction must be prompt , clear and tough .
In football terms this was a one-two which the referee should not have allowed .
The Commissioner 's reaction to Mr Bourlanges , who asked a number of perfectly reasonable questions , was certainly not the courteous reply which Parliament would have expected and prompted the VicePresident in the chair to intervene .
Our citizens are now looking for concrete results , especially in view of the extra resources and extra positive effects on employment promised by Commission President Santer .
The report says that very clearly .
It remains to be seen how the Union will act over extending the mandate of IFOR to identify and arrest war criminals in former Yugoslavia .
In this respect I find the report most encouraging .
I think that did little to imprint the Union 's identity on the minds of the rest of the world , an identity which is largely recognizable only to citizens of the EU.
Priority should be given to an IFOR-style peace-keeping force of the kind we have in Bosnia and to a EU planning and analysis unit .
I should like to address myself primarily to the President of the ECOFIN Council .
I also advocate a discussion of fiscal erosion in the context of the stability pact .
But we must not make the children suffer and we must limit the damage as far as possible .
Here too it is splendid that a new Brussels II convention is currently in the making .
The procedure we have initiated this year actually has three new features .
I should expressly make the point that we are not questioning agricultural policy as such here .
Specifically as a result of this , in the current ad hoc procedure , we propose that a sum of 556 million units of account be placed in the reserve .
But the Council did something different .
So if I appear to know a lot about agriculture the credit is Mr Sonneveld 's and not mine .
On the basis of that a reserve of 556 million ECU has been agreed , available for programmes for the development of agricultural markets and support for rural development .
This is the essence of the position agreed jointly by the Agriculture Committee and the Committee on Budgets .
Initiatives of which I approve .
So there is no saving here .
It is good that more cooperation agreements have been concluded with countries in these regions , in the event Latin America and Asia .
And that is not counting loans for the final year .
A further criticism is that the European Parliament was consulted very late in the proceedings .
The Commission chose that time because this is when loans to countries in Central and Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean will run out .
It is a good thing to have just one policy for loans to third countries .
I have had a few reports myself .
The result is your doing .
Mrs GÃ¼nther 's report is an excellent one .
Embassies can approve small-scale projects on their own initiative and it always works very well .
The problems so clearly outlined by Mrs Kinnock are very real and I thus hope that a large majority of the House will support the amendments so that we can secure a change in the EU 's policy and introduce greater flexibility into its workings with the NGOs in the field .
It is to be hoped that this regulation will put an end to the confusion surrounding EU financial aid to the reconstruction of former Yugoslavia .
My Group thus calls once again for attention to be focused on implementation .
In our view there is one major omission , namely support for the development of democracy , and that is a major shortcoming of this regulation .
And I am looking at your officials .
India is only ready to sign if the timetable for total nuclear disarmament is accepted .
Mr President , a full
