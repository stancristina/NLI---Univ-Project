I would like to thank the national associations and European networks that have lent me much support in this work , Parliament 's intergroup on the social economy , which is working well , the shadow rapporteurs , and also Mr Verheugen and Mr Å pidla , with whom we have had a frank and thorough exchange of views .
China broke up these talks , accusing the Dalai Lama of being violent , causing violence and seeking independence rather than autonomy .
If we agree on the importance of creating a common European system and if we want to avoid opportunistic relocating , then now that the framework is complete , following the European Company and the European Cooperative Society , it would be a good idea to plan to reopen the issue and take it to the next level . rapporteur . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in the last year the number of refugees worldwide has increased .
We are at present in a paradoxical situation whereby recognition rates of candidates to refugee status for certain third country nationals vary from approximately 0 % up to 90 % depending on which Member State receives the request .
Many Member States ignore this , however , including Italy , which has signed an agreement on managing migration flows with Libya , a country that does not intend to sign the Geneva Convention on refugees .
This is the paradox : even asylum seekers must be subject to mixed flows to enter the EU.
I think that there is a basic error in this reasoning : the issue of defending borders and the issue of asylum are two wholly separate matters .
We are well aware that this is a difficult route to take , but there is no other way to reach our destination .
We must not forget that the directive has come about due to the fact that the previous directive has , until now , not proved easy to implement in the Member States .
Our thanks for this go to Mr Krahmer , who has played a very important role , listening carefully and even revising his initial positions .
With the attention to detail and input of all the shadow rapporteurs and , first and foremost , the staff and the rapporteur , Mr Krahmer , whom I would like to thank for his honesty and patience , we have maintained complete transparency in adopting the BAT , exchanging information and publishing the operative conclusions of these documents on the Internet .
My country has already paid a high price for uncontrolled industrial development involving Seveso , Eternit and others , with consequences for the landscape and local people .
This , moreover , is the material point : there exists , particularly within the Council , a concept of Europe as the sum of the governments of national states .
I hope that Mr Cashman will accept our proposed amendments , particularly on greater financial transparency , and I believe that as the European Parliament , we should set a good example .
I read today in the press that our decision to publish parliamentary attendance - this has nothing to do with this report - a decision taken in this House , has , however , apparently run up against technical problems that will prevent it from being implemented before the European elections .
I think that a designation clause should be added so as to avoid discrimination between Community carriers and those of the European Economic Area and Switzerland .
I find , in fact , that I do not entirely agree with the work carried out by my fellow Member .
I agree with the rapporteur that it is essential to evaluate and assess existing measures within the framework of border management before investing further resources and developing the systems that the Commission seems to prefer , namely an exit/entry system for all third country nationals , a registered traveller programme (RTP ) also open to them and a framework for the development of local registered traveller schemes and automated border controls .
Combating the effects of these serious violations of rights does not resolve and will never be able to effectively resolve the underlying problem , for which other instruments should be used .
Mr President , I voted in favour of Mr Doorn 's report on implementation of Directive 2006/43/EC on statutory audits of annual accounts and consolidated accounts .
I would like to conclude , then , by stressing the need to guarantee an equal gender mix in the decision-making and consultative bodies involved in recruitment , promotion , rewards and funding , as well as in the other branches in the sector , in order to introduce statistical monitoring to produce comparative analyses of the working situation faced by women in the various countries of the Union Mr President , I voted in favour of Mrs Gibault 's report on equality of treatment and access for men and women in the performing arts .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted against Mr Krahmer 's report on industrial emissions .
I am firmly convinced that in this sector , which , incidentally , generates a very important source of income for sports organisations , there must be complete transparency that safeguards public and consumer interests .
Huge progress has been made in the field of competition over recent years .
We should be satisfied for a variety of reasons , which are those that concern the Union as a whole , because it is clear that allowing the European Union to create for itself regional regulatory areas where international standards already exist to govern them , and to come between the Member States and international organisations in defining rules , is something that must only be done when necessary
