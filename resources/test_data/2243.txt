In future , initiatives for devising common rules should be taken by the national parliaments and not by the Commission or Parliament .
It is the legal basis which , of course , decides whether it is to be a case of voluntary coordination or binding rules .
In that way , democracy will at least have a chance in relation to the present system of legislation by officials to which we have become accustomed , even if all fifteen Member States profess to be democracies .
This is referred to by the polite euphemism of a 'democratic deficit ' .
It is actively anti-democratic .
The idea is to establish a democratic dialogue .
It sounds so appealing , of course , but this very project reflects a total misunderstanding of the nature of democracy .
Democracy is literally government by the people , which means that the people ' s wishes , demands and political views prevail , without direction from above .
It is the same trend and the same mechanism for development whereby living democracy is dismantled piece by piece in favour of government by an Ã©lite .
What is happening is in direct conflict with the best grassroots traditions in Scandinavia .
It is a most regrettable situation and a political identity crisis for our Swedish friends .
Mr President , I appreciate from the Council ' s answer that fish are to be discussed at a later date , but I should nonetheless like to know how likely it is that the Cardiff integration process will take account of environmental problems in connection with external aspects of other EU policies , such as the damage to the environment resulting from the fisheries agreements with the West African states .
I should also like to know whether the idea is to develop more specific integration indicators , to assemble data sources and to make use , in the Council ' s work , of the ad hoc consultation carried out by the Commission when preparing its communication .
Mr President , I did not fully understand the answer to the question about the Council ' s view of the NMD programme .
I understood that there is now a project aimed at eventually developing a common European missile defence system in cooperation with the United States .
As far as I understand , the Council is responsible for the Common Foreign and Security Policy , so it is presumably the Council that has to come up with a position on this matter .
In several places in the report , however , the impression is given that these observers ' task as missionaries for the EU overshadows their role as election observers .
We find this competition for media attention highly inappropriate .
One of these provisions specifies that , in future , a qualified majority is required for introducing increased openness in the Council .
Furthermore , Parliament was not consulted on this subject .
So I call on you , Madam President , to address this issue the next time you meet with the Council .
However , I think you should , in any case , discuss this matter with the Council , and I believe that the Council should , in all decency , withdraw its decision until agreement on a regulation on openness has been reached with Parliament .
Mr President , I would also like to thank the three rapporteurs for their fine reports and add that I definitely believe that these reports indicate that we consider the budget a political instrument .
In particular , I should like to highlight Mr Costa Neves ' report .
I think this is a splendid priority , and we must ensure that it is reflected in the Budget , especially within the area of what are called internal Community policies .
In collaboration with the Liberal group , I have put forward an amendment to the effect that we must continue with the reform of the funding under the so-called ' A 30 lines ' .
This is something that must be addressed .
As a parliamentarian , I believe we must support the Commission ' s work on ensuring transparent management of the funds so that taxpayers can be certain that efficient management is in place and that the political objectives are being fulfilled .
The argument that ' we are used to being funded ' must not be the decisive factor , and there must be the possibility of innovation and new initiatives .
It is essential for the EU that the Commission has a good reputation externally and that there should be no doubt that we have a good and stable administration .
Therefore , it will be a great moment , for Parliament as well as the Commission , when we put it to the vote tomorrow .
Maybe not quite yet .
A shock wave went through the system when the Santer Commission was removed in 1999 .
Parliament can and will use the discharge to remove the Commission if it does not live up to expectations .
This year , there are certain MEPs who will refuse to grant discharge .
I believe that would be a very big mistake .
If we do it every year , the threat , of course , loses its value .
I think that this is what most MEPs want .
Undoubtedly , this has improved the report , as well as the atmosphere in the Committee .
Mr Kinnock has promised us the best administration in the world .
I have prepared a very critical , yet constructive report .
In 1999 , things were simply a mess .
There was no overview of the internal and external audit reports , and the archive was also in something of a mess .
We must hope that the reforms will remedy this .
I
