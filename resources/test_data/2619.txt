as possible .
Mr President , I am very pleased to add my support and my group ' s support to this report .
This report had a long gestation period .
But the fact that we are still here so early in the morning is a tribute to the rapporteur ' s work on this programme and , indeed , that of the Commissioner and the Portuguese presidency - which has shown itself to be committed to youth , to the voluntary service and to education in its broadest sense .
The report we have ended up with now is more closely targeted , with an emphasis on social protection and , as the rapporteur has said , a more flexible approach than in earlier reports .
We also have more money in the programme in recognition of its importance .
We will always ask for more money .
The budget is not enough .
It is perhaps Parliament ' s role to ask for more .
But we can be pleased with the outcome .
We can be sure that whatever money we have in this programme will be directed at youth and will , in the long-term , be money well spent .
I agree with the rapporteur that this money and this programme will ensure that the efforts are targeted not just at some small sections of society but , as the Commissioner said in a previous report , at all sections of society .
We must look to those who will benefit most and those who are in greatest need and who might otherwise be socially excluded .
We are delighted that some candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe will benefit as well .
We can be pleased with our efforts and pleased with this report .
In seven years ' time we will look back at the youth of today who will have benefited from this report and be pleased that this was the beginning of real progress .
Mr President , I also commend the report and thank Mrs Gr√∂ner for the excellent effort she has made .
It is a very good report .
Youth is the sector in our Community that is so often ignored .
Indeed in the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport it is the " Cinderella " sector of funding , as with sport .
We hope that imbalance will be redressed .
The insufficient commitment to youth affairs from the Council , when the European Parliament was calling for EUR 980 million , shows , in my view , this grave disparity and the lack of commitment on the part of the Council to a very important sector .
The danger , in this regard , with the changes that are proposed , of combining two programmes - Youth for Europe and the European Voluntary Service - is that several good parts of both those programmes might be lost .
I hope that does not happen .
We should include the best parts of those excellent initiatives in whatever programme we formulate in future .
The new Youth Programme emphasises the developing links with the youth of entrant countries .
That is an excellent initiative .
The bridges built between youth will be the bridges that eventually unite Europe .
The agreement to constantly review the situation is an initiative that I welcome .
When more funds are needed , budgets should not be cast in stone but be flexible so that they can be amended in the best interests of the deserving needs of youth .
What more deserving cause could there be than supporting youth in the European Union .
Mr President , I think we would all agree that , if we are to run the Community properly , we need a high-quality statistical base within the Community and the applicant countries .
There has been a broad welcome in the House for this proposal and the apparent ability to give priority to the revenue actually collected rather than the more notional contributions which may be due .
This is certainly a step forward .
It seems logical to use the revenue collected as the basis for determining the actual percentage deficit .
So far as the transition period is concerned , many of us will have sympathy with the need for some form of transition because , clearly , if you amend the regulations in such a way that you move from a system which is being used over a long period of time to a completely new system some time will be required .
However , I hope that the countries of the Union will not use this as an excuse , if it is passed , but seek to implement the new system as rapidly as they can - in other words , two years should be regarded as an exception and as a maximum rather than as the normal ration for the job .
On the treatment of taxes and social contributions , I agree with the rapporteur that this is a relevant way of doing the calculations and that we should take a favourable view of the criteria which the Commission intends to set because of the way in which priority is given .
Overall , this is a useful step forward .
I welcome the commitment of the Commission .
I hope that we can work together and see this translated into Community law with suitable adjustments as soon as possible .
Mr President , it is high time that we resolved this complex and long-standing issue once and for all .
As we all know , there are many competing claims - the claims of ACP banana producers , Community banana producers , EU businesses which have been hit hard by US sanctions , the EU 's role and standing in the WTO and , of course , the rights and interests of European banana consumers
