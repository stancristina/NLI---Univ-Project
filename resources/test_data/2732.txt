area .
And thirdly , that he was preparing Plan Colombia for military intervention in the area with the United States , going behind the backs of European and world opinion .
Mr President , as Manolo Medina said , once again we are talking about Colombia .
But if what he says is true , it is a catastrophe for Colombia .
I would like to recall the words of President Pastrana in this Parliament : " I believe that a decent and democratic future is not possible without a culture of respect for fundamental rights .
Mr President , unfortunately , kidnappings in Sierra Leone are once again in the news .
The European Union must therefore use every means within its power , not only in order to help fund the peace process , but also , above all , in order to make it possible to establish living conditions that make peace irreversible .
Today , we are not faced with a merely political issue , but with a criminal act that falls under a criminal code .
Mr President , as my colleague Mrs Uca said , it is unacceptable for a country that wishes to become a member of the European Union to bombard defenceless people , kill more than 30 civilians and injure more than 40 people .
I asked him whether the Commission would complement this rhetorical support with any kind of support that did not just consist of words .
Secondly , the European Year of Lifelong Learning highlighted the Commission 's difficulty in providing information and responses and being transparent .
We have therefore requested clarity and better organisation of the system as a whole .
We consider that it is enough to be a European citizen and we do not realise that if we want to have researchers , if we want to have a truly competitive Europe , we need to take care of our human resources .
The report by Mrs Cristina Guti√©rrez-Cortines , and she has also mentioned this today , shows the imbalances that still exist in the field of education between the level of the European Union and national level , that is , on the one hand we want action in education at European Union level , but on the other , the Member States do not want to give up their competences and establish true cooperation on an educational level .
This is the highest level since the Gulf war , and is a level which most experts believed could only happen in cases of geopolitical crisis .
Furthermore , the European Union ' s level of dependency currently stands at around 50 % .
However , unless we introduce new measures , we will reach more or less 70 % by 2020 .
On the one hand , the need to strategically promote dialogue on energy policy in international fora , and especially with the large producing and consumer countries , and , on the other , the need to adapt our priorities so that we can better focus our changes in the face of adverse energy situations such as the current one .
We must say that we are the main net importer and the second largest consumer of oil in the world .
To this end , Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in a few minutes I will leave this meeting to depart for Luxembourg , where a special Council of Transport Ministers is taking place .
Ladies and gentlemen , in this context I must say that a reduction in the special taxes in favour of road transport can only be considered as a very short-term measure , lasting no more than a few months .
We will also have to examine the question of competition between intermodal sectors in order to find solutions on a European scale .
The future Green Paper on supply will contribute to it .
Unfortunately , we do not have access to a panacea to resolve this situation in the short term , but luckily this current crisis has shown us the only way to overcome it : to promote competition in our markets , consolidate our common presence at an international level , coordinate our actions , adapt our priorities to the new energy objectives and act together in the fiscal field .
I would like very briefly to point out that , in recent times , thanks to more rigorous budgetary management , there has been talk of lightening the tax burden .
Ten dollars per barrel of oil was far too low a price and , furthermore , it had negative effects on our economies , although this seems more complicated to explain .
I would like us to try to communitise this , but , in the mean time , we must coordinate the energy policy of the Member States .
However , they are going to change simply for market reasons , even if OPEC does nothing .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I must now leave you because I am running a little late for the Council of Ministers in Luxembourg .
In this delicate field of data protection we must achieve two fundamental objectives : transparency in the future functioning of the secretariat and the independence of its work .
As we will see , these are different aspects of the same problem .
The introduction of new technologies , computers and telecommunications has broken down barriers and transcended borders .
This still does not seem sufficient to us , and we hope that , at least in the legislative and supervisory field , we can have further competences .
Inform us of any situation of risk .
Or it may perhaps fall to the administration itself through the insufficiency , and therefore ineffectiveness , of the inspection , advisory and control services responsible for informing , advising and , where necessary , penalising non-compliance with the employment legislation .
