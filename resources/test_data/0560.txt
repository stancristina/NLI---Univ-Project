from temporary protection .
We understand the difficulties which have arisen in studying this problem and we will support any steps which may lead to a solution .
We just have to hope now that the Council does its duty .
We should truly be considering whether the European institutions are providing a rigorous response to European society ' s current demand that we create a policy on immigration which respects the principles of freedom , equality and justice that go hand in hand with European culture .
And yet here we are , going through the motions of a debate all over again .
All too often we are presented with apparently simple proposals concerning very real and complex problems .
These two Members have already explained far better than I could the technical and legal reasons why they advocate rejection of this proposal .
Will we have to re-enact debates held prior to 1992 ?
That is to say , the next amendment does not fall .
Mr President , this report is all part of the changeover from UCLAF to OLAF .
That is our message to the citizens and we must ensure it reaches them .
Perhaps the opportunity missed at Nice could be retrieved through some specific proposals .
However , by the 1998-99 season it was already being cultivated on 100 000 hectares .
In the first place , there is penal liability as it applies to individual owners of processing plants .
It has to be said that such was indeed the case .
This is because it affects citizens ' law and the development of European citizens ' rights , over and above States , regions and any other party with an interest in wielding power .
Recent disasters are making it clear that the citizen increasingly has the right to manage the risks he is exposed to .
However , I should like to speak in support of Mrs Korhola' s report , which was adopted unanimously by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .
One of the difficulties experienced by the earlier Directive 90/313/CEE was precisely the delay in transposing it into the Member States ' own legal systems and the unsatisfactory manner in which it was implemented during all those years .
Commissioner , I should like to know whether , under the measures you referred to , direct aid to farmers is already being provided or will soon be .
I should like to repeat it if I may .
Commissioner , I am aware that you have spoken more than once on the subject of my question .
What specific negotiating action could the Commission undertake in this connection , to give some satisfaction to consumers ?
My specific question , Commissioner , which probably already has an answer , is this : given that the Lisbon agreements talked about full employment , is it not awful to use public funds to create jobs in this way while continually losing jobs through company restructuring , privatisations and mergers ?
Questions to Commissioner Barnier Commissioner , first of all I should like to thank you for your answer and very briefly request that , since the Commission is the Guardian of the Treaties and the Treaties state that the Community must contribute to the enhancement of the cultures of the Member States and to respect for regional diversity , it should ensure that those Member States within which several languages that also have official status coexist can take part in organising the events planned for the European Year of Languages .
If energy efficiency can be improved by 2.5 % or 1 % as the Commission proposes , we shall have succeeded in adding one more grain of sand towards achieving the objectives of the energy policy , which are to respect the environment , achieve a competitive market and improve the security of our energy supply .
It is important that at the same time as we debate this issue we should think about promoting other forms of energy and carrying out consistent policies in other fields .
I am aware of how difficult Mr Wijkman' s report was to prepare and the effort he had to put in to present such a clear and concise document as he has presented today .
That is , we can grow more and at the same time still contain growth in the demand for energy .
The idea put forward by Mr Wijkman that the Commission and the Member States should turn major public buildings into symbolic demonstrations I think is highly appropriate , and this is something I have emphasised in the past .
In today ' s case , we are approving something that is not to do with energy saving but with the effectiveness of the whole system : the liberalisation of the gas and electricity sector .
The President-in-Office has said that the debate began on 7 March .
In this instance , I think you were playing with an advantage .
We propose an open and transparent method which involves all the participants .
Mrs Lindh , I believe that I do not need to speak at length , since the President of our Group , Mr Poettering , has made a clear , apposite and brilliant speech in which he has spoken loud and clear .
However , as a starter , I will say that it has to take place on a national level , in democracy that is close to the people , and on a European level .
Therefore , things may be amended , others may be joined together , but it provides us with a model which may be of use .
Firstly , structural reforms and liberalisation .
This morning , after becoming aware of this information , the Socialist Group made a written request to the Parliamentary services to issue that reply
