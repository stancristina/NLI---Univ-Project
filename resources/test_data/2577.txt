In the United Kingdom considerable credit could well be paid to the former Conservative government for effecting just that , a policy which has been continued by the current Labour government .
However , last October the Hatfield train crash took place in Hertfordshire , part of the eastern region which I represent in this Parliament .
Four people lost their lives and many were seriously injured .
The accident took place on a bend with the train travelling at 115 mph .
It appears that the infrastructure authorities were aware of the fracturing of the rail as early as November 1999 and a further report was made in January of last year .
No remedial action was taken .
The British transport minister , Lord McDonald , has announced there will be no be no public inquiry .
However , named members of Railtrack , the infrastructure company , and of Balfour Beatty possibly face manslaughter charges as a result of this accident .
I turn to the Commissioner , who I am sure is aware of the details of this particular accident , which I would point out is not unique within the European Union , and I would hope that she would be able perhaps to dwell on the consequences of the crash .
In the United Kingdom there has been chaos on our railways , there has been plummeting customer confidence in the rail system , remedial work has caused huge financial investment and Railtrack has threatened a delay in work on the Euro Channel Tunnel Phase II programme which is very much part of the integrated European rail system that we all support .
I very much hope that the Commissioner may be able to give some support to the relevant authorities in the United Kingdom .
This is not merely a domestic issue .
It has European ramifications as far as the Channel Tunnel work is concerned .
It may well be that additional support can be given through the TENs programme and I look forward to my discussions with the Commissioner on this extremely serious development .
Mr President , I want to congratulate Mrs Mann on her carefully prepared work and have great pleasure in supporting it .
The importance , as Mrs Mann has emphasised and the Commission proposed , of a single budget line , is not just about simplifying Parliament ' s work .
It is so that we can properly evaluate and vote on what money we are spending on which projects so that the Commission and Parliament can jointly consider what is best value for money and how we need to spend money in the future .
The emphasis Mrs Mann has given to the importance of clarity about the division of responsibility between the Community and the Member States in the field of export promotion is also crucial .
There is some sensitivity about this and clarity about the budget line and the legal base are not only going to help us to do our work in a more logical way but also reassure the Member States that there is a proper allocation of responsibilities .
I want to comment very briefly on two other matters .
I was very pleased as President of the delegation between this Parliament and the US Congress that the transatlantic legislators ' dialogue merited a mention in the budget report .
You know , colleagues , how much emphasis this Parliament has put on the TLD.
And Mrs Mann' s report mentioned , among the many other excellent projects , the European Institute in Washington supported by the Commission .
It is just one example , but an excellent one , of how cooperation , not only financial but political , industrial and commercial , can pay very considerable dividends .
I am delighted to support Mrs Mann and as I am finishing my speech with one second to spare , I hope I will receive a bit of applause for that .
Mr President , this report concerns the proposed adoption by the European Union of the United States ' energy star programme as it applies to office and communication technology equipment .
This , colleagues , is not the sexiest title on this week ' s agenda , perhaps , but it is directly linked to the future of our planet and to the possibility of even more devastating weather events , mass movements of people and crop failure .
Our irresponsible and profligate use of energy , with its consequential emissions of C02 and other environmental hazards must stop .
Ironically enough , it is in the United States , where the energy star scheme originated , that we have recently seen the absurd spectacle of power cuts in California , largely because of the incredible increase in the use of computers and other office equipment with the accompanying need for air-conditioning within a framework of quite bizarre and unwise deregulation .
Things would have been even worse without the energy star programme .
This scheme , which is voluntary , was introduced in 1992 and is now very widespread .
It has been officially adopted in Australia and Japan for example .
Members may in fact have seen the energy star logo on computers bought in the EU , although this means nothing yet since the technology has to be specially activated , which is done only in the United States .
This evening we are discussing the draft regulation which will implement the US/EU agreement on which we shall vote in the next session .
It is a voluntary scheme and it is hoped that between now and 2015 savings of 10 terawatt hours and 5 million tonnes of C02 emissions will be achieved in the EU through this scheme .
I now enter the world of science fiction and explain that to be energy-efficient , computers must go to sleep , but they must wake up instantly when they
