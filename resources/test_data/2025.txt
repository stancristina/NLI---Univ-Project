weighting of votes , the number of Commissioners and the number of decisions to be taken by qualified majority , whether the institutional consequences have been discussed with the applicant countries , whether there are any applicant countries which have said that they do not wish to have one Commissioner each , and whether any of them have queried the institutional ideas that are now being aired in the corridors ?
In other words , what is the position of the applicant countries as regards the institutional questions ?
This is a sector which attracts considerable public attention .
It might be said that fortunately this passion has so far only been expressed in words .
I shall not go into all the points which the rapporteur has made , but simply present the overall view of the Liberal Group as a guideline for the future work of the Commission and the Council , since that is ultimately what is at issue .
It must be said that we do not have this at the moment .
And secondly , as I said , this therefore means that we must have a requirement for individual countries to publish their lists of homeopathic medicines and also to explain how they are approved , for example whether they have been approved under Articles 7 and 8 , because in that case we have already come a good deal of the way .
In our opinion , a simplified registration procedure should not be used either for medicines for human use or those for veterinary use , which can enter the food chain .
Instead , I think that we should consider a positive list of harmless substances and diluents .
In particular , I have been very pleased with the support there has been for a number of amendments we have tabled , and I am glad that we are agreed on an approach which is aimed at placing the responsibility on the Commission and not singling out particular officials , but insisting that it is the Commission which accepts the political responsibility for the situation .
This is a very serious matter that we are dealing with today .
I can only deplore the course of events , because the fact is that we cannot close the matter with this report , but once again have to call on the Commission to take action and once again say what steps we in Parliament will be obliged to take if the Commission does not comply with our requirements .
Let us be clear today if it is willing to do so , or if it is simply going to cock a snook at Parliament 's requests .
For that reason , Commissioner , I cannot urge strongly enough that we should bring this matter to a conclusion and see that the necessary action is taken , so that we can all honestly say that we have rectified the mistakes and the shortcomings , as well as the procedures which are necessary to enable the Commission to live up to its responsibilities .
I am pleased that we have made such progress with this action plan , and I would like to compliment the rapporteur on what is an excellent report .
In this sense , the Internet is part of a revolution which enables us to communicate with people throughout the world .
This is very difficult to stamp out , as we all know , and I am glad that we are proceeding with this European action plan , which can try to prevent the spread of illegal material .
However , it is very important for us to distinguish between what is illegal and what is offensive or morally damaging .
The great thing about the Internet is precisely that there is no censor in the middle of it .
The Commission should not have a monopoly on deciding what is morally correct .
This is illegal in all the Member States , and we can all agree that it is damaging to children 's rights .
So let us begin a joint action to combat child pornography as soon as possible and extend the competence of Europol , so that we can combat international networks which produce , sell and distribute pornographic material of this kind .
The proposal codifies the Helsinki declaration while allowing the Member States to go further in terms of strengthening the protection of patients , which is also a focus of the committee 's amendments .
Firstly , there is the question of whether the Member States should authorise a clinical trial when the ethics committee has said yes , or if authorisation can be withheld in some cases .
And thirdly , there are the time limits which are to apply to the work of the ethics committee .
I think it is extremely important to preserve the Member States ' ability to reject an application , even if the ethics committee has said yes .
As regards the question of whether it is possible to proceed automatically , or if notification has to be given or a positive authorisation obtained , I would emphasise that I think this is also important in terms of patient protection .
Experience with the present ethics committees shows that ethical considerations and decisions take time , and so we should not set too short a time limit for the ethics committee to do its work .
Mr President , when I received the Court of Auditors ' annual report yesterday , I read it with great interest .
I have read the report countless times overnight , but I cannot find anything about Denmark in it .
It is always good to be able to take that as a starting-point .
I would like to ask Mr Friedmann , and also Mr Liikanen and the Commission , not just to focus on nuclear power plants in the eastern countries
