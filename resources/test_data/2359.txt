the subject on this occasion because I want to call strongly for genuine help to be given to farmers - for this document does not provide sufficient protection for them - and , in particular , because I want to draw attention to the fact that there is currently a huge crisis in Italy over powdered and other milk .
" But we ca n't go checking up on what happens to our money" , I replied .
I disagree .
I therefore trust that my recommendation will be acted upon .
I endorse the content of the report , particularly the part which calls for an analysis of the impact of changes to the laws of the Member States on Regulation 1408 , relating to people who have worked in more than one State , and especially that part of the regulation which concerns rules for the payment of the pensions of people who have worked in more than one State .
I would like to highlight two aspects of the issue : on the one hand , in our countries , protection of the environment is hardly ever considered at the planning stage of the various sectorial policies but continues to be viewed as a series of actions to be carried out a posteriori in order to repair damage .
The protection of the environment crosses national borders and is a field of Community action par excellence .
One of the best solutions can only be to revoke the measures laid down by the CAP.
It is time to evaluate carefully how the distribution of contributions - as , by definition , income support - reaches undertakings able to compete on the global market .
At the last part-session in December , we all - Commission and Parliament - criticised Nice because the countries ' desire to protect their own national interests took root once again and we condemned that Council for placing the Community method in crisis .
In fact , in situations such as that of Sicily or Sardinia , some of the traditional coastal fleets , which have grown up and survived in a local context thus far , feel threatened by the impact of globalisation .
Madam President , I would like to start by thanking the Commission , the Council and the High Representative for agreeing to take part in a debate on this subject and to reassure the High Representative that we are not going to reopen here a backdated debate on the motives behind the operations in the former Yugoslavia ; it would not be right , apart from anything else because the context has changed radically .
Rather , it is a matter of realising that the military problem has become a civilian problem and concerns the protection , for a long time after the operation itself , of the health and lives of civilians as well as soldiers .
Well then , a European Parliament which is now faced with a motion calling for such respite is cowardly , reckless , antidemocratic and irresponsible : antidemocratic in any case because it is disregarding the commitments called for by parliaments and governments in times of need .
I must , moreover , point out that depleted uranium is used in civil contexts in many other sectors , and we should certainly investigate these extremely thoroughly .
Mr President , last summer I went on holiday to Guinea-Bissau , and , as is my wont , I exchanged a few words with one of the local elderly pensioners , or rather with a fisherman from Guinea-Bissau would have dearly loved to have become a pensioner .
However , over and above our common goal , we feel that certain elements of the Council 's proposal deserve careful consideration .
Finally , objections could be raised to the increase in the volume of information sent to the European Parliament , even through the consultation procedure alone , but , since we hope that the list of topics subject to codecision will be extended , we feel that , in specific cases of geographical or political importance , the Commission must not hold back from informing Parliament .
In any case , I will raise the issue when I give my explanation of vote on the Oomen-Ruijten report , which deals with this subject " .
Mr President , I voted against this document because I feel that there has been too much hypocrisy at play in this issue .
" But , as you know , my dear general , " replied the President , "war involves calculated risks and we must run these risks as well . "
Some of them are well over a 100 years old and , both personally and as nations , we have become attached to them .
Although the Treaty of Nice is not completely satisfactory , or rather not at all satisfactory , it is still a step in the right direction and will allow us to continue along the path we have already embarked on .
The second E is for employment .
Our citizens are concerned about environmental and consumer protection issues , including food safety which is currently particularly important .
I therefore welcome the emphasis placed by the presidency on these matters .
When I last stood before this House , I made clear my disappointment not only at certain aspects of the Treaty which had just been agreed but , in particular , at the atmosphere which had reigned throughout the Summit .
The first lesson is that nothing positive or lasting can be done to guarantee the future of Europe without the immediate involvement of the whole of Europe , including , of course , all the candidate countries .
My purpose is to use this exchange of opinions to reach practical conclusions on the objectives to be pursued and the means to be employed to achieve them .
