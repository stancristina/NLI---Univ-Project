companies with head offices in Sweden are not always quoted in Sweden .
If , moreover , we open the door to defensive measures , we shall perhaps make it more difficult to restructure European markets and , especially , to protect small shareholders .
Those of us in the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party were very critical at first reading , and we still are .
As a previous speaker said , flourishing galleries and good systems of grants are important for young artists .
Also , no other country in the European Union has such fast distribution of post from abroad .
Allow me briefly to say a few words regarding the quite obvious hypocrisy also found within this sector .
Allow me to conclude by thanking the rapporteur , Mr Ferber , who has made several attempts at reaching a compromise .
If this date is set later than , for example , 2007 , it will , in my opinion , be completely meaningless .
By then , the market will have resolved this issue .
Madam President , allow me to address Mr Simpson .
The Royal Mail competes with other companies and delivers letters to me in Malmö in Sweden .
The text of the report takes the wrong line .
This , of course , also applies to the postal market .
Madam President , the Swedish postal service was completely liberalised as early as 1993 .
We in this House must give the postal market a chance .
The costs are not higher than in other countries .
This proposes that only 30 per cent of the votes shall be sufficient to take control of a company .
The situation is alarming .
The Indonesian government and the army have pledged to ensure the safety and to protect the lives of their citizens , irrespective of the religion they profess .
Mr President , as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , I would like to say that , as regards taxation of aircraft fuel , I am pleased by the reaction from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
The number of flights is also expected to double in around 15 years .
The Commission ' s communication states that the effect is so small that it is not worth doing anything about it .
This kind of reasoning is dangerous because it can easily lead to a situation in which no one does anything anywhere .
I think that the fairest thing from the point of view of the different transport sectors and also from the point of view of competition is for us to lead the way and introduce aircraft fuel tax within the EU.
This was proposed at the Lisbon Summit last spring .
If Europe is to be the world 's most dynamic continent and able to surpass the Americans when it comes to attracting the companies of the new economy , we need to provide good e-commerce opportunities .
These rules lead to a distortion of competition which obviously needs to be remedied , but the Commission 's proposal is a step in the wrong direction .
It is an old-fashioned way of thinking which does not fit in with the new economy .
Mr President , let the experiences from the taxation package serve as an example .
Mr President , since Mr Sjöstedt is no longer able to be present in the House , I would like to say a few words on his behalf with regard to the report on the taxation of aircraft fuel .
Finding a method for the taxation of aircraft fuel that works is therefore one of the key issues of climate policy .
Therefore , point 16 of the report concerning the renegotiation of the Convention is particularly welcome .
One of the four organisations is ECPAT , whose measures in this area during 2001 , which are eligible for aid , are wholly covered by this application .
In addition , specific projects financed within the framework of the European Union 's policy for development and external relations can also relate to work in the fight against child sex tourism in countries outside the European Union .
I would like to thank Mr Liikanen for what was in all respects a very positive and excellent reply .
Do the funds that are being granted involve more money , or is it a question of the same level as before ?
This means that measures to be carried out during 2001 can be financed by funds covered by the budget for that year .
If this is the case , then I thank you for that .
This is a direct consequence of the decision to abolish duty-free .
This can also be regarded as a competition-related issue , as duty-free goods can continue to be sold in the southern part of the Baltic on the crossing between Stockholm and Helsinki , whereas they are not permitted to be sold on the journey between Umeå and Vasa .
In my opinion , we should instead base our assessments on scientifically substantiated risk assessments .
If they stop using it , they risk having a poorer diet .
Last weekend I met a number of dieticians who were concerned that the withdrawal of permission to use ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose would lead to those with a gluten allergy having problems with their intake of nutrients .
He has now found out that the European Parliament wants to ban the cellulose in his diet and also in his Christmas food .
As Mrs Patrie has already said , 80 percent of the population of Europe live in towns or cities .
Better knowledge and new technology provides the opportunity for a better environment in Europe 's towns and cities
