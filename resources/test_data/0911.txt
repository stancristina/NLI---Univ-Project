And , of course , there is currently considerable reaction on the part of numerous countries to benefit transfers , due to the huge financial costs involved .
Thus , the programme sets three objectives , to be achieved through close overall and two-way cooperation between Member States .
These factors will be studied , so that a strategy and policies can be drawn up designed to ensure that individual measures are of a high quality and to make health protection more effective .
As well as the coordination objective , several other objectives have been included which are connected with the introduction of an integrated health strategy through the development of an inter-sectoral policy in the definition and implementation of all Community policies and activities .
For this reason , binding provisions are being introduced for the development of comparable health data and compatible information systems as well as express provision for the protection of personal data .
In view of the above , amendments have been proposed so that the objectives of the programme can be achieved .
These are new forms of integration which I refer to as new convergences and which add breadth and depth to the unification process .
This is the first time advances in European policy in the health sector have been set out , achievements and weaknesses have been identified and the difficulties in applying a consistent Community policy have been made clear .
We also need to stress how important it is to increase public awareness and for the public to be actively involved in health issues .
As far as creating a European Coordination and Monitoring Centre is concerned , I think that it should work under the aegis of the Commission and should draw up programmes of priorities in the health sector , taking account of international data .
My congratulations for that to the Commissioner , who demonstrated a personal awareness and responded to our proposition by including this issue in his proposal .
Scientific data clearly show the extent and seriousness of neuro-psychiatric illnesses and our response , albeit belated , must be direct and effective .

The EU 's intentions in the particularly sensitive area of public health are clearly set out in the conclusions of the recent Council summit in Stockholm .
This strategy on the part of the Ã…U makes health totally dependent on the laws of the market , cost considerations , profits and returns .
Thus , despite quite rightly referring to serious and persistent health problems , he makes no mention of the real social causes of or the circumstances which aggravate the health and threaten the lives of our citizens , such as deteriorating working conditions , alternating and night shifts , the dramatic drop in the standard of living of large swathes of the population , the spread of poverty and unemployment , the repercussions of unbridled , profit-driven liberalisation of the market on the food chain , the deterioration in the environment etc .
It is also quite deliberate , because any positive measures proposed in the report ( design standards , new services etc. ) will basically be enjoyed by disabled people from the wealthy classes .
Typically , not one EU text mentions the need for social spending in order to address the problems of people with disabilities and , here too , we must rely on non-governmental organisations , volunteers and the family to deal with the acute social problems of people with disabilities .
As far as special education and training are concerned , apart from a few generally positive but non-binding proposals relating mainly to tertiary education , the text is based on the unscientific approach of placing pupils with disabilities in mainstream schools , ostensibly with a view to integrating them into society as a whole .
All the integration approach does is to cut social spending , shift the financial burden onto the family and provide the disabled with a second-rate education .
Which is why we need to strengthen our citizens ' sense of security , fight organised crime , strengthen police and judicial cooperation , mutually recognise court judgments , develop an integrated , viable immigration policy based on our common European values and fight racism and xenophobia in the European Union .
And as we know , this sort of situation causes serious problems , both to the working of the Commission , which does not have the human resources needed to respond to all these initiatives , and to the working and the agenda of the European Parliament .
As far as immigration
