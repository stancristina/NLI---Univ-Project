There is evermore sophisticated equipment available for such activity , which means that counterfeiting is nowadays much less complex than it used to be .
The three legislative proposals for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting with which this report is concerned are mutually complementary .
It is concerned , then , with protection under criminal law and with Europol units having to receive the information and intelligence they need in order to perform their tasks .
The proposal is based on the establishment of a system for the exchange of information and for cooperation and mutual assistance .
There is no way in which they can offset such a loss anywhere else .
This is a position which Parliament definitely ought to adopt in order to protect people .
The third legislative proposal is based on Article 308 of the EC Treaty and is aimed at taking care of those Member States which have not adopted the single currency , namely Great Britain , Denmark and Sweden .
I am convinced that people in these countries realise that they too must participate in these decisions .
The decision as to whether or not to adopt the euro is one requiring strength , and on this point I would call upon my own country , Sweden , to try to summon up the strength to take this decision as quickly as possible .
The fact that Sweden , in contrast , did not is something I deeply regret .
Europe is a world leader in the manufacture of synthetic drugs .
This initiative against synthetic drugs ought therefore to be warmly welcomed .
Such information enables the police more easily to identify illegal centres or networks manufacturing drugs .
At present , such laboratories unfortunately exist only in Sweden , Germany and the Netherlands .
The Member States are obliged to allow these to pass through their territory .
It therefore has nothing at all to do with the sensitive debate about what should be readily available on the street , for personal use etc .
It is not perfect in every respect .
Regarding the actual transmission system , I take the point also touched upon by certain countries such as France and , especially , Spain , to the effect that it would be good if these samples could be transmitted electronically .
I completely share that view .
This Parliament will certainly have an extremely important role to play when it comes to pushing the issue of electronic transmission , but I really do hope that Spain will not use this as an argument for stopping the transmissions .
As I see it , it is downright irresponsible to weaken the fight against organised crime , just because we do not have the perfect system .
I also want to congratulate the Swedish Presidency on this decision , which may well be the first binding decision in the area of drugs .
I should like to take this opportunity to ask us to think in the longer term .
We tried to make cows , which are vegetarian , into omnivores , and that gave us BSE.
It is in modern times that we have left nature so far behind that we have begun to embark upon such experiments .
The matter may at first sight appear trivial , but we Swedes remember the Swedish ambassador to Portugal , who has now been retired for a good 20 years , who refused to leave his residence in Lisbon because his life companion , an old Angora cat , would be forced to remain in quarantine for a long period in order to be able to enter Sweden .
We must , however , make sure that the rules are designed in such a way as to provide adequate protection against the spread of rabies to , in the first place , areas that are free of the disease .
Nonetheless , animal diseases too , including those affecting pets , can be very aggressive and cause great suffering .
The undersigned therefore submitted a proposal to the committee to the effect that the Commission should review existing legislation governing trade involving animals with a view to attempting to achieve harmonisation with the rules in this proposal for a Regulation .
Apart from dogs and cats , ferrets are the only pets that can spread rabies .
There are now scientific proofs that vaccinating ferrets against rabies is effective .
Reference to ferrets ought , however , to be introduced into Annex 1 , Part A , alongside reference to dogs and cats , and , if this is not approved , ferrets should continue to be referred to in Part B as per the Commission ' s proposal .
' That is how much the national freedom to determine one ' s own financial and tax policy is worth , ' the opponents of EMU in my homeland cheerfully chuckle .
Obviously , there is a common monetary policy , but financial , budgetary and tax policy must not and cannot be managed in detail from Brussels .
It seems as if , as Mr Herzog also pointed out , there is a dogmatic opposition to such change .
The only thing that I would like to say to the Commissioner today is that I hope that the Commission ' s organisation is sufficiently flexible to be able to take account of the need for cooperation between its different areas and to be able to react quickly to the changes required .
Relating to Amendment No 14
I am attempting for the third time to point out that the wording of Amendment No 4 is different in the final version to that in the version adopted by the committee .
