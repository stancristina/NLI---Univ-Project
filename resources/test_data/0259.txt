in this area .
It is the overall context in the region and the overall context for implementing the Stability Pact that provide a solution for this situation .
You must also understand that the international community and the EU Council of Ministers have a view of events which is very different to your own .
We should not imagine , Mr Korakas , that all the blame can be placed on one side .
We have implemented an Energy for Democracy programme to support democratically governed municipalities in Yugoslavia .
We shall make appropriate gestures towards Serbia , in terms of providing services , of lifting sanctions , when Serbia ' s behaviour , both on the international stage and in its relations with its neighbouring countries , and its behaviour within its own borders , is in tune with what we consider to be the fundamental principles governing the international community and the behaviour of "decent " countries on the world stage .
We do not feel that withdrawing international forces now would be any kind of solution .
What is a legitimate target is obviously a grey area .
In spite of everything , all this represents only one of many kinds of highly pernicious action perpetrated by Mr Milosevic on Yugoslavian society , and the European Union is of course inevitably concerned about this situation .
This is of course extremely important for the Community of Fifteen .
There are various problems that must be addressed in this area .
That issue is whether this charter only applies to citizens of the Union or whether it also applies to third-country nationals who are resident in the Union .
We will have to find some common ground on this matter .
The Portuguese Presidency is keen to ensure that , as soon as there is consensus on the charter among the people drafting it , it should be incorporated into the Treaty on European Union and that this issue should immediately be referred to the Intergovernmental Conference .
This procedure falls within the competence of the members of the group , and the matter will only be submitted to the Council if and when consensus is reached on the terms of this charter .
I presume , however , that this is not a particularly controversial matter and we think that it would simply involve bringing together the currently agreed corpus of rights , which even the most elementary justice would suggest should be included in the charter and be shared by the Union as a whole .
( PT ) To answer your question , Mrs Lucas , we must consider this issue from two angles .
The objective of these guidelines is precisely to see that officially backed export credits are used properly , that is in a transparent and disciplined way .
The G8 therefore recognise the importance of credits both for exports and for the environment , and the importance of the work currently being done within the OECD on this subject .
Furthermore , it was in this context that a representative of the United Kingdom stated in 1999 that he envisaged guaranteeing that export credit insurance would take second place to safeguarding the type of issue that you mentioned in your question , Mrs Lucas .
In accordance with Article 246 of the Treaty , the auditing of accounts is carried out by the Court of Auditors which , to this end , studies the accounts of all revenue and expenditure of the Community as well as the regularity and the legality of the underlying transactions .
I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that the Budget of the European Union is approved by common agreement between the Council and this Parliament .
I do not think that I can give a more complete answer on the specific case that you quoted .
We are therefore taking advantage of this political will in an attempt to define the outlines of a compromise , and we have already begun work on this matter .
This has , from the outset , been the position of the Portuguese Presidency .
- ( PT ) Without wishing to show any lack of respect towards this House and particularly because of the respect that your questions deserve , I would rather not answer the questions you have raised immediately .
I will be happy to come back to Parliament to respond to and clarify the problems which may conceivably occur if a result is not reached , or to congratulate all of you if this result is achieved .
Mr President , I have no desire to enter into the realms of philosophy .
The European Parliament ' s opinion on the activities of the ACP-European Union Joint Assembly has always had a major impact , undeniably contributing to a consistent policy and role for the European Union in development and cooperation .
In line with the resolution at the Nassau meeting , we must concentrate on meeting the poverty reduction targets agreed by the international community .
People in the poor countries are beginning to despair .
The European Union ' s contribution under the Stability Pact , now converted into what is called the " stabilisation and association process " , represents a development in the regional concept the European Community drew up in 1996 for the five countries of the region : Bosnia and Herzegovina , Croatia , the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania .
They have suffered enough , first under the Soviet yoke and then from the high price they paid for being forced to become part of the communist bloc .
That is why it is so important .
Due to its importance on a world scale , the euro will be particularly exposed to the risk of counterfeiting and forgery .
