look again at the way in which we organise our work .
Mr President , this is only the fourth point of order I have raised in nearly eleven years as an MEP , so I hope you will listen .
I want to ask you and those others who preside over these sessions to be much more strict about points of order .
We lost nearly half-an-hour this morning and many of the points of order that were raised then , and are often raised here , are things that Members have just thought of that they would like to share with others .
That hardly constitutes a point of order .
I suppose I feel particularly peeved because my own report on e-Europe , which is the only thing from this Parliament before the Lisbon Summit , has been squeezed off to a time when there will be a relatively poor attendance .
I ask you - and I echo Mr Watson 's point of order - to take those points back to your President and co-Vice-Presidents and ask them to be much tougher .
It might make you unpopular in the short-run but I think it would make you loved and admired in the long-run .
I agree with Mr Pirker , and it is probably the only thing I will agree with him on if we do vote on the Ludford report .
It is going to be an interesting vote .
It is unreasonable at this stage to postpone it to a time when a lot of people will have left .
If you are intending to postpone it to 5.30 p.m. , it will totally distort the vote on this report .
I urge that we carry on now , understanding all the difficulties that you have mentioned .
Mr President , I should like to request that it not be taken this evening .
The vote will be totally distorted .
We know that a lot of people will leave this afternoon .
They do not expect this kind of vote on a Thursday afternoon .
Could we not postpone it until the April plenary session in Strasbourg ?
Mr President , I want to give the explanation on behalf of the Liberal Group in respect of the Commission 's legislative programme .
We abstained as a group throughout this vote .
The reason , as we made clear during the debate on Tuesday , is because we believe the process to be flawed , not because we necessarily have any quarrel with the content .
Having put this marker down for this time , in the future we would like to see the process reviewed so that it amounts to more than just ourselves as a Parliament swapping lists with the Commission .
We want something more substantial and meaningful .
- This report confirms our worst fears about the intentions of some people in relation to the Charter and that is why we have voted against it .
We are not voting against a Charter itself , but so far the process seems to suggest a wasted opportunity to protect the citizens of Europe from the overburdening powers of the European Institutions .
There is a gap to be filled in providing fundamental rights to citizens of the Member States concerning European regulation and legislation .
This report turns its back on this need and thereby devalues the potential of the Charter .
In the process of voting against , we have , of course , tried to improve the contents in the interests of the members of the nation states of Europe who might be affected , and some of the amendments which we have supported are aimed to do this .
Conservative MEPs will continue to examine the progress of the proposed Charter through our representative on that body , Timothy Kirkhope , MEP , ( Yorkshire ) , and in discussions with our colleagues in the European Parliament , and we will be as positive as possible in this exercise .
However , we do not hold out too much hope of converting this whole exercise into something which could be really positive in turning back the tide of legislative bureaucracy and over-regulation , and genuinely protecting the human rights of the citizens of Europe .
- British Labour Members fully support a Charter of Fundamental Rights which makes visible citizens ' rights across the EU.
However , we are at a very early stage in the process of determining the Charter .
It is therefore too early to say what should be legally binding .
This decision will be made at a later stage as recognised by the report itself in Paragraph 6 .
That Paragraph also states that any legally binding status recognises that Fundamental Rights are indivisible by making the Charter applicable to all the European Union 's institutions and bodies and all its policies .
This is a recognisable aim which British Labour Members would support .
As the final Charter text is not available , we are supporting the Charter in principle but awaiting the final version .
This is a complex process which needs clarity and precision at all stages to ensure that the end result is a positive and visible step forward for people in all EU countries .
My Group voted in favour of the Jackson resolution on Structural Funds in the environment because we believe in the principle of ensuring effective implementation of environmental law - in this case , the wild birds and habitats directive .
However , we are surprised that Members of this House voted for the original proposal in paragraph 7 to cut off funds to some of our poorest regions in the EU.
Indeed , the Commissioner , in a response to the debate , said she would not be stopping approval of key funding programmes
