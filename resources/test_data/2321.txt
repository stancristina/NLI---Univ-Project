We said that we could not accept responsibility for the accounts before the electorate until the Council agreed to meet formally with the relevant committees in Parliament and to answer our questions publicly .
Nonetheless , to demonstrate our goodwill , we voted in November to grant discharge to the Council 's accounts - on the clear condition that changes would be made this year .
Let me give a specific example .
In other words , in addition to the funds already in the travel account .
Why are you doing this ?
Which countries are benefiting from it ?
Up until today , however - though this may change - the Council has refused to answer openly and publicly .
We are therefore of the opinion that any discharge must await an interinstitutional agreement that clearly sets out the Council 's obligations in respect of transparency and cooperation with Parliament .
Our criticism of the Council and the Commission is clear .
It is shared by many of our fellow Members in other political groups .
I therefore find it regrettable that the report by the Committee on Budgetary Control ended up being less critical than it had been in the Chair 's original version .
I hope that at the vote in May , there will be broad support for the fact that our willingness to take a critical view of ourselves is precisely what gives our criticism and demands of the Council and Commission added strength and authority .
The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have abstained from the vote on this proposal , as they believe , firstly , that this is unnecessary legislation because the requisite legislation is already in place in this area .
The issue of financing security charges should be entrusted to the individual Member States .
We support an ambitious animal welfare policy that increases the degree to which animal welfare is taken into account in accordance with Article 13 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union - possibly in the form of a system of positive incentives .
I voted in favour of the European Parliament 's own-initiative report on evaluation and assessment of the Animal Welfare Action Plan ( the Paulsen report ) , because I fully support the objective of strengthening animal welfare in the EU.
However , it is not clear in the report whether the EU is to establish maximum harmonisation in this area .
I would not under any circumstances be able to support a future proposal that prevented Member States from producing better mandatory standards for animal welfare than the standards that we are able to agree on at EU level .
The Danish Social Democrats voted in favour of the report on agriculture and climate change .
The European Parliament has voted on the discharge in respect of Parliament 's own accounts for 2008 .
It is a clear victory for both transparency and control and is in keeping with the traditional Danish view of good practice .
These include increased clarity and openness with regard to the use of additional funds and the accountability of the financial players in Parliament .
The European Parliament has to grant discharge to itself each year and that is precisely why a critical review is needed .
Moreover , a great deal of support has been shown for this critical report across many groups in Parliament .
Mr President , we disagree on many things where the EU is concerned .
We doubtless also disagree on many things where the European Parliament is concerned .
So , here we are today with a proposal that forces us to face the fact that this can change .
I think this is a very bad development .
It is , of course , contrary to the Treaty .
However , it is also contrary to what we actually do in practice .
Did we say that the Members from these countries could sit for two-and-a-half years without elections being held ?
This should be the case even if elections are to be held in only one country , for example in France .
Mr President , there is something bizarre about the situation that we find ourselves in right now .
For years we have heard how the Treaty of Lisbon would be the instrument to ensure democracy , transparency and citizens ' influence on legislation in the EU.
There is something rather strange about this .
Both of these fundamental elements - and , incidentally , fundamental promises - will be destroyed if the two reports are adopted .
Like the previous speaker , I therefore have to say that my group cannot support these reports .
This Textile Regulation is a sound proposal and a necessary one .
We in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament therefore support the proposal as a whole .
It must not benefit industry alone .
It is also very important for us to focus on what is good for consumers .
Therefore , in our work on this proposal , we felt it was vital to ensure that consumers receive clear information on the fibres and textiles that they purchase .
However , we did not want to stop there .
I believe that it is quite important for consumers to know the contents of what they are buying , where the clothing was produced , whether it contains substances that could cause an allergic reaction or whatever else they may need to know .
It was therefore important for us to say that we believe it to be important for a more detailed investigation to be carried out into how we can create a proper labelling system for textiles that benefits consumers .
Personally , I also believe that it is quite important for us to take a closer look at clothes sizes .
We Social Democrats fully support the
