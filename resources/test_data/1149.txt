On the contrary , it exposes us to risks because it is impossible to predict the characteristics to which a modified gene may give rise in its new environment .
On the other hand , if we cannot put a stop to GMOs , strict rules are naturally needed .
What is , however , unique and serious in this case is that it entails subsidising , for foreign citizens of other Member States , an activity that I specified by name in my question , that is illegal in a number of Member States and that involves inviting citizens of other EU countries to engage in an activity that is illegal in these EU countries .
I have , however , a question for those of you responsible for the internal market .
Do they impede the internal market and lead to distortion ?
Above all , I wish , however , to say to you , as Commissioner with responsibility for the internal market , that I believe that the differences in levies affect consumer behaviour and create unequal conditions of competition .
Firstly , I wish to express my gratitude ; secondly , I wish to explain why I do not like the compromise ; and thirdly , I wish to explain why , in spite of everything , I support the compromise .
In that way , we should be more credible in our negotiations , for example within the WTO , with the United States .
If they are used as growth stimulants , then they are clearly present in our food .
That is what we do in the EU , and it undermines our credibility and our opposition to these hormones .
The committee was in agreement - as was Parliament , mainly , at first reading - about proceeding in this way .
Of these areas of use , the first is the main one and the other two of relatively little importance .
My proposal , which became our proposal following contact with the other political groups , was that we should propose to the Council that the substances be kept for the purposes of the two less important areas relating to dead foetuses and pyometra .
I see this as major progress , and we can thus perhaps solve the problem .
I think it is only right to show solidarity with them .
If we wanted to achieve a reduced quantity of waste and reduced mileage , especially for lorries transporting waste on motorways , we should begin by discussing packaging , the role of packaging , logistics and how we could gain a huge amount , both environmentally and in terms of road use , from having fully adapted packaging .
We shall , in the main , support Mrs Corbey 's compromise proposal , even though we have not , for various reasons , endorsed it .
It is therefore very important that we give due weight to the annual report , which we are debating today , on the implementation of the budget .
There are a number of matters of particular concern to us this year , for example , outstanding commitments .
We are also concerned about the 2002 surplus of EUR 7.4 billion , even though it is an advance , given that , last year , it was more than double this at EUR 15 billion .
The recent visit of our delegation to Bosnia , like a host of other contacts , also makes us worry that a lack of information about the new budgetary arrangements may have caused problems , for example for the external delegations .
Within the separate expenditure categories , we are still critical of the way in which export subsidies for the transport of live animals are dealt with .
What most concern us , however , are the structural measures .
Quite a few fellow MEPs have mentioned the N+2 rule , which we must arrange to be applied effectively .
We are , on the other hand , pleased that there is a positive trend , prior to enlargement , when it comes to the programmes for small and medium-sized businesses , as well as for the pilot project concerning small and medium-sized businesses .
We only hope that the situation in Iraq and the Middle East does not give rise to such a degree of uncertainty in connection with the 2003 budget that it could entail problems for the other areas within external policy .
Where this is concerned , I hope that we shall see a radical reform in the future .
Your work will , however , be scrutinised carefully , for there is no immunity in this House against political blunders and infringements .
I must unfortunately ask myself the question as to whether the Italian Government really is capable of shouldering that responsibility today .
That is a very worrying development that affects the whole of the EU and that would not have been accepted if it had happened in any of the EU 's new Member States .
The gloomy question we now have to ask ourselves is whether Italy is a country that fulfils the political Copenhagen criteria .
Chechnya is an international issue .
At the same time , we in the EU , too , must contribute to the reconstruction .
People who commit serious war crimes , including rape , must not be able to avoid being brought to justice .
The United States 's action cannot but give the impression , however , that the United States has no intention of taking legal proceedings against its citizens if they are guilty of serious war crimes .
I assume that the Commission and the Council will vigorously oppose this conduct and press for the United States to accept the International Criminal Court as an important legal instrument for combating serious war crimes .
I still want
