.
He knows perfectly well that ours is a non-political Head of State .
He knows perfectly well that for nearly fifty years she has scrupulously avoided engaging in controversial political issues .
He knows perfectly well that she cannot come to this House to set the record straight .
His behaviour is a disgrace and a scandal .
Mr President , I am proud to be British but today I am ashamed to share my nationality with that man .
Has he no shame ?
Has he no respect ?
Has he no decency or honour at all ?
Mr President , well , how can I respond to such an attack as that ?
When I raised the point on Monday , and on Tuesday , and on Wednesday , I asked Mr Helmer for his comments on the euro .
So far , he has refused to comment .
Can I also say that when Mrs Fontaine spoke to Her Majesty the Queen and obviously put certain questions to her the Queen , in her response , was representing her government , which is a Labour Government .
That might not suit Mr Helmer , but I am sorry to say that is the way it goes .
Can I also say yes , I am Scottish , yes , I am British , but , Mr Helmer , I am European as well and proud to be .
Mr President , the report that I am presenting this morning is effectively a dual report which reflects the work of the committee itself and the work of the office of Parliament 's Mediator for Transnationally Abducted Children , Mrs Banotti .
I should also like to express my personal appreciation of the work of Mr Söderman , the Ombudsman .
I should also like to thank the secretariat of the committee not least for the statistical break-down which is provided there which , I must confess , is not my own work .
I would urge Members who are not familiar with the Committee on Petitions to read these reports .
It might well be of use to them in providing a service for the people they represent .
I would also draw their attention to the website mentioned , set up under the Europe Direct initiative , which could provide useful information and possibly avoid the need for a petition or indeed confirm it as an appropriate vehicle .
There is a growing need for such information as people become more aware of the importance and relevance of the European Union level .
The aim of the Committee on Petitions itself is to provide a good and effective service for individuals within the European Union and for civil society generally .
Any individual , citizen , resident or group may petition Parliament if they feel that Community law or principles are not being properly applied at whatever level .
Last year we received 958 petitions of which 492 were considered admissible .
I will mention just two of them to demonstrate the range of the topics and the potential effectiveness of the mechanism .
We had one British petitioner who succeeded in getting her years of teaching experience recognised by the French authorities , presumably affecting her salary and promotion prospects .
In another case a petition from a Spanish citizen , acting for an environmental association resulted in infringement proceedings being brought against the Spanish authorities in relation to the Habitats Directive , a frequent cause of complaint - the directive , not the authorities - with lasting national effect .
It is such cases which provide valuable feedback to the European Parliament and the other institutions as to how our legislation works to the benefit of the individuals and society , or not , as the case may be .
We could not do our work effectively on this committee without the support of numerous Commission officials who investigate cases and instigate proceedings where necessary .
I wish to express our thanks .
We know we could provide a more rapid and effective service if Member States could provide an equally committed response in replying to requests for information and explanation .
In one case we are currently dealing with it has taken 14 months to get a reply to a letter .
That is not unusual .
That is why we are recommending that the Council or relevant permanent representation should also be represented at our meetings so that they develop a greater understanding of the problems citizens face and respond effectively .
I would draw the Council 's attention to points 8 and 10 of the report - if it was here .
The aim of the committee is to improve the overall quality of our feedback mechanisms .
Some of our ideas are mentioned in this report .
Others will appear in a further report in September from Mr Perry and Mrs Keßler .
We are proposing , as we did last year , a database mechanism so that petitioners and Members can track the progress of reports and see where the problems lie .
We trust that the relevant authorities will bear this in mind this year and act on the proposal .
There are various points concerning our relations with other committees .
We would ask them to call on the Committee on Petitions more often to express an opinion on certain areas where concern has arisen .
We would like to be involved in preparing joint reports on areas of particular concern such as the environment , social security , consumer protection and so on .
We would also wish to use the experience of our committee members through their work on other committees of Parliament to institute a rapporteur-style system for specific topics .
We are also keen to establish links with petitions committees in other Member States , with a view to exchanging good ideas and understanding
