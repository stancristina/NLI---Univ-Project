I know that reform within the existing European institutions must take place .
However , any changes within the internal decision-making procedures must be balanced and fair .
We do not want to see a two-tier European Union in which larger Member States dictate the pace at the expense of the smaller Member States .
For example , the report which we are debating today recommends a rotation system for the composition of the European Commission .
This will mean that the automatic entitlement of smaller Member States to have one Member of the Commission will be downgraded .
I do not believe that this is a particularly sensible proposal . 380 million citizens of the Union have an affinity with the Commission .
Certainly , from an Irish perspective , Irish people recognise the importance of the Commission as an institutional body within the European Union .
It is still the institution that controls the operations of competition policy , the common agricultural policy , the common fisheries policy and the common transport policy .
The Union must draw nearer to the citizens of the Union .
We should also remember that some Member States , including my country , must hold a referendum on any Treaty changes that arise at the forthcoming IGC.
The loss of an automatic right to nominate a Commissioner would certainly be a very difficult , if not impossible , proposal to sell to an Irish electorate in this referendum .
I would now like to return to the issue of extending the qualified majority voting system at European Council level .
The Council represents the interests of the 15 Member State governments within the institutional framework of the Union and currently , under existing EU Treaties , unanimous agreement of the 15 Member States is required for any tax changes sought within the Union .
The report we are discussing today seeks to extend qualified majority voting to all legislative activities except those of a constitutional nature .
I believe that national Member States should retain the right of veto on taxation matters .
The Irish taxation system is innovative in many ways and has contributed to our present growth rates .
I do not believe that the extension of qualified majority voting to taxation matters at European Council level is a particularly welcome development .
President , Commissioner , we are faced with a fundamental difficulty , in the exercise in which we are involved , in maintaining the balance between enlarging the EU and reforming the institutions to make that enlargement possible .
British Conservatives cannot accept the report , based on the long list of ancillary items which are not on the agenda of the IGC.
We are concerned by the proposals for constitutionalisation of the Union , by the proposals to incorporate the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Treaty , by the progressive diminishing of the distinction between the first and second pillars , by the proposal that the Council should adopt broad guidelines of economic , employment and social convergence policies by qualified majority .
These are just some examples of the complex and controversial issues which are raised .
We are overloading the wish list of the IGC.
The great danger , if all these extra items were to be adopted on the agenda , is that the deadline of December 2000 would inevitably be missed .
Where would that leave the candidate countries like Poland and Hungary , whose government leaders have already expressed concern over the timetable ?
We believe the IGC should concentrate on the essential institutional reforms .
It should ensure that it meets the deadline , to enable the first wave of enlargement to include Central and Eastern European countries by 2004 , and to continue any further necessary reforms with the full inclusion of our new partners .
If the EU delays enlargement too long , it may make it more difficult , or impossible , for some candidate countries to join within the envisaged timetable .
The President-in-Office addressed some of these concerns in his speech .
Commissioner Barnier in his speech said that the intention is to succeed with the reforms , not necessarily to conclude them .
Some people say that this is the last opportunity for reform .
I do not think that is a very fair reflection on the extraordinary reforms that many of the candidate countries have made in the last 9 and 10 years since they were within the Warsaw Pact or formerly part of the Soviet Union .
Our priority is enlargement .
We should not confuse or reverse our priorities .
Mr President , my group welcomes this report .
It sends a clear message to the IGC to be ambitious , to think long-term and not short-term , to think of how a Union with nearly double the number of Member States we have now can actually function effectively and to take this opportunity to change the Treaties , because future IGCs with nearly 30 states around the table will find it even more difficult than it is now to agree on reforms .
The report puts forward ambitious proposals , as one would expect of the European Parliament .
If adjusted by the amendments by my group , it will be a well-balanced set of proposals , well-balanced notably on the delicate question of the equilibrium between large and smaller Member States .
On the size of the Commission , for instance , the formulas that are likely to be adopted tomorrow will refer either to one Commissioner per Member State or to a smaller number , a fixed number of Commissioners .
The Commission cannot go on expanding indefinitely .
In the second case , it will be a rotating system , so that every Member State , large and small , has equal opportunities of seeing one of its nationals serve in the Commission
