However , it is precisely these disparities that are largely preventing us from making progress , and I do not think that drawing up a varied Ã  la carte list of models is the solution .
It is the time for sensible , balanced , and , in the best sense of the word , European approaches .
In my country , for example , where we have ownership unbundling , there are many problems .
If it is mutual , as occurred in the case of the gas market , we will be able to arrive at formulas that fulfil our objective .
As the rapporteur and the other speakers said , this is a necessary exercise , but obviously we should try to clarify it .
I would like to point out that the suspension of customs duties is only granted for products destined for the domestic market , and also say that this proposal was adopted practically unanimously in the Council and by a very large majority in the Committee on Regional Development .
As the Commissioner said , it is about continuing with an instrument that has already been in force for many years - since 1991 - that expired in 2006 , thus filling a regulatory gap that existed until today .
I think it would be good to have a greater political presence of the Greens in the institutions of the Canary Islands , but with initiatives like this , full of demagogy and false accusations , believe me , I would like to say to the Member tabling the amendments , you are going in the wrong direction and you will have less and less political and social support in the Canary Islands .
If the amendments are adopted , those who have tabled them will have succeeded in putting up prices for the citizens of the Canaries and making the difficult task of maintaining the tourist industry still more difficult .
The attitude of Mr Staes reminds me of the mother who went to see her son at the passing out parade for his military service and said to the person beside her : ' Look how good my son is , because he is the only one who is marching properly , all the rest of his company are out of step ' .
She has spent the last 19 years in prison , since July 1989 .
First , release of all political prisoners .
I would like to take advantage of the presence of the Commission to ask what it is doing or plans to do in this regard .
Most of the children were sentenced for murder , but many sentences seem to be based on unreliable confessions , obtained by torture and during interrogations at which the detained were denied the right of access to a lawyer .
Enzymes are added to food to perform a wide range of technological functions in the manufacture , processing , preparation , treatment , packaging , transport or storage of such food .
The rapporteur thinks that all of this is very important , as food safety will be improved and consumer choice will be increased , and consumers will have more information on what is in the food they eat .
The most controversial subject that has been raised in this proposal on flavourings , from the start of the debate , has been the biologically active principles that are naturally present in herbs and spices , which posed a major problem for herb and spice producers , as they found that they were unable to comply with the requirements of the proposal , given the special nature of their products : different harvesting locations , times of the year in which they were harvested , eating habits in the various countries , etc .
The bilateral energy agreements with Russia with hardly any EU coordination are also bad news for a solid EU foreign policy with a single voice .
With regard to these priorities , we also feel that consideration should be taken of the life cycle of each technology and its environmental impact during the production process , and that transfer of these technologies to developing economies should be taken into consideration in order to reduce the technology gap with these countries .
This text could subsequently form the basis of an optional element but , to do this , we first need to define what the content is .
The Commission has demonstrated this knowledge and awareness by proposing a set of measures which redefine the regulatory framework which was adopted in 2002 .
As time is pressing and the debates have already been lengthy and will continue to be in the future , I must now refer solely to BERT.
I agree with her because I believe that protection of intellectual property , like the protection of privacy and other legal concepts , have already been defined in other legal frameworks .
Parliament is offering a number of proposals which , in my view , are generally fairly well balanced , and will produce a satisfactory outcome to negotiations with the Council and the Commission .
First , we proposed promoting equal behaviour in schools , and removing the gender stereotypes which are still too widespread in some media ; taking measures to change the segregation of labour in the different stages of the schools system so that there is equal involvement of teachers of both sexes at each stage ; eliminating any discrimination in terms of salary on grounds of sex in the fields of education , culture and sport and communication ; and encouraging greater participation by women in the management bodies of those sectors where women are in the minority .
What do we hope to achieve by applying the precautionary principle and preventing the import of cloned animals ?
