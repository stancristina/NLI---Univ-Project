not .
We subsidise it with millions of euros .
If we ban existing products , alternative products may be even more dangerous .
As Mrs Garc√≠a-Orcoyen has pointed out , this has already happened , for example , with breast implants , where alternatives to silicon have proved to be more dangerous than the implants they replaced .
In trying to defend an untenable position the Commission has shamelessly sought to gag its own scientific advisers .
It has bowdlerised their reports , it has pressured them into changing their positions .
Honesty and transparency have been sacrificed to expedience .
I and other colleagues wrote to Commission President Prodi on this point two months ago .
I understand that his reply has been held for some time 'awaiting signature ' , presumably to ensure we should not see it before today 's debate .
Neither the temporary bans nor the permanent ban are justified by the evidence .
Migration tests for phthalates are currently under development and will probably be available within months .
We should wait until these tests are available and then , if we must , impose migration limits .
We hear far too much about the precautionary principle .
To be meaningful the precautionary principle should be invoked only when there is a clear and demonstrable risk .
If we continue to invoke it when there is no prime facie risk at all , we make both the precautionary principle and ourselves look ridiculous .
Mr President , on a point of order : as chairman of the Environment Committee I would just point out that the rapporteur 's job is to present the report of the committee .
If Mr Papayannakis wants to express a personal opinion , he should have the freedom to do so .
What he cannot do is to confuse the two .
Mr President , this legislation on the labelling of beef has two distinct aspects .
Firstly it ensures traceability of beef products .
Cases of food poisoning related to beef are rare , and more often than not can be attributed to storage and preparation in the home or catering outlet , rather than to the processors .
Occasionally , however , there is a problem such as the E-coli outbreak in Scotland .
In this instance labelling can enable the public to be alerted without inducing panic , and facilitate the tracing back of contaminated beef to the shop , slaughterhouse or farm where the problem started .
Secondly , labelling will identify the country or countries of origin of beef .
This is not to assist xenophobic consumers who wish to reject all things foreign - although there is nothing wrong with the desire to support one 's own farmers who are facing unprecedented economic pressures .
The BSE crisis shone a spotlight on the possible health risks associated with beef .
Some countries , like France , have a whole-herd slaughter policy which may reassure consumers , despite its lack of scientific basis and a risk of underreporting .
The United Kingdom , on the other hand , which has a higher level of BSE incidence at the moment , removes all animals over 30 months from the food chain , as well as adopting a whole raft of other measures .
We could argue all day about which beef is the safest , but the fact is that once labelling is in place the consumer will be able to decide .
There can be no justification for the continuation of the illegal French ban on British beef if it is clearly labelled .
In fact those in France who have studied the subject in depth may well decide to buy British as the safest and tastiest option .
I will now comment on the amendments .
The inclusion of category is unnecessary , costly and potentially confusing to consumers .
Most housewives do not know the difference between a heifer and a steer .
A bony Holstein steer would be in the same category as a champion Charolais but that prime animal 's twin sister would be in a different category solely because of its sex .
Clearly this is a ridiculous situation .
The listing of category imposes costs on farmers and butchers , and at the same time would give consumers irrelevant or misleading information .
It could also devalue some categories such as young bulls , as supermarkets rationalise the categories they stock .
If France wants to continue with its scheme alone , then I would not want to stand in its way .
This is a subsidiarity issue .
The amendment on Article 14 would prevent the confusing situation where minced beef - marketed for example , in Austria , Mr Fischler - which was derived from Polish animals imported live into Austria , could be labelled 'prepared in Austria ' .
I am not sure that Austrian farmers would like that to happen .
Without this amendment this potentially misleading suggestion could encourage more live imports , with obvious animal welfare implications .
We are working on a very tight timescale on this legislation , which is due to come into effect on 1 September .
It would , therefore , be irresponsible of Parliament to adopt amendments which could not be accepted by the Council .
There is no time for conciliation .
I do not subscribe to the argument that Parliament should abdicate its constitutional right to improve this proposal because others have failed to initiate the legislative process in time .
We now have a new French presidency - I do not know if anyone is there representing them - but I commend to the Council the amendments adopted by the Committee on the Environment with a large majority .
Could I ask through you , Mr President , that the Council or , failing that , the Commissioner , makes a statement to Parliament
