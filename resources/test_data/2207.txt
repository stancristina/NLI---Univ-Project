.
I believe that the Committee on Budgets is trying to evade the codecision procedure , and I would propose to this House , and also to the Commission , that their amendments not be taken into account ...
The basic regulations date from 1986 and 1992 , and now the budget for implementation is lower , despite the fact that , since the accession of the Nordic countries to the European Union , the area of forest is greater .
We have European directors who have worked with American companies , who have made fantastic films .
Firstly , I wish to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Lambert , for taking up all our proposals in the debate .
The most important petitions deal with social and environmental issues , which are the matters of most concern .
In this respect , both the Committee on Petitions and the Ombudsman play a key role , on different levels and with different purposes , but they are both nevertheless essential to the improvement of the operation of the institutions .
With regard to Mrs Lambert ' s report , I would like to deal with two specific issues .
It is true that we sometimes take a long time to reply .
It is not always the Commission ' s fault .
We also accept the definition of maladministration as being when a public body does not act in accordance with a rule or principle which is binding upon it .
I would like very briefly to point out that these institutions are important because any action by an administration may at some time display a lack of transparency , a lack of efficiency , a violation of basic rights or even corruption .
Mr President , Commissioner , with globalisation we have discovered with pleasure that , above all , aeroplanes can take us from our own city to any corner of the world , and we have enjoyed this so much that we can no longer live without flying .
Mr President , Madam Vice-President of the Commission , both the Commission ' s communication and the rapporteur ' s report , which is magnificent , are in line with the European Council of Lisbon , which asked the Commission for a series of specific proposals as soon as possible .
There is a clear need to achieve more effective cooperation between the different users of the airspace , and I believe that that cooperation and a joint approach should be sought at European level .
We must make it very clear that not all delays are due to the management of air traffic ; almost half of all delays are due to air companies , airports and sometimes weather conditions .
As the ' Single European Sky ' illustrates , I believe that what is failing is the management system , since it is in a fragmented situation , divided up by administrative barriers , by administrative borders - in a European Union which has been able create so many common elements - and because of the artificial divisions between sky for military use and sky for civil use which persist in many countries , even though we left the cold war behind some time ago .
In principle , the High Level Group , to which I am going to communicate Parliament ' s conclusions at the next meeting on the 14th , will finish its work by October .
Countries may deal with this within their own competences , but it is outside of this ' Single European Sky ' initiative .
Society must care for working women in particular by ensuring that they remain in their jobs .
The ban on dismissal during pregnancy must be strictly complied with .
The pregnant worker must be provided with adequate protection , which is designed for their specific circumstances , but this should not mean discrimination or a reduction in their work opportunities , but quite the opposite .
That is the reason for the delay in presentation .
Yes , Mr President , I note that the law is not equal for all , because I wanted to speak along the same lines , in the previous sitting , on the resolution on Feira , and I was not given the authorisation to do so , and I did it at the right time in the end .
I recommend to Mr Poettering that he reads the report carefully .
From this House , we urgently request that the British Government immediately remove this machine from the bay and repair it in England , where we suppose that they will at least have the appropriate facilities to do so .
Furthermore , we should take account , for the purposes of coordination , of the programmes of financial aid of the Member States and the Community regions .
I hope the Commission is capable of mobilising the necessary human resources to deal with the priorities indicated by this Parliament and I am sure that , if the Commission , as it has proposed in its preliminary draft budget for 2001 , is going to be able to spend EUR 815 million in the Balkans , it will also be able to spend EUR 50 million in Venezuela .
Mr President , I simply mean that where there is a will there is always a way and that this resolution demonstrates a decisive commitment on the part of this House to show its will to help and cooperate .
We must remember for example that the European Union is the main foreign investor in Venezuela and that we have many cultural and social ties with those countries .
Nevertheless , this is a relatively modest increase - of only 3 % cumulatively per year - and this is less comparatively than the increase over the same period in land transport , which has been 26 % .
