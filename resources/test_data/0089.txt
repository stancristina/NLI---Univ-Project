I supported the report by my colleague , Mr Guerrero Salom , in order to remind the Member States of their responsibilities to developing countries in the face of the global challenges of the economic crisis and climate change , for which they are not responsible .
This is a mistake : their prospective replacements would be just as 'world compatible ' as they are .
We asked Greece to take some measures .
History never repeats itself and certainly not in the same way .
In that respect too we must , as I have just said , learn every possible lesson as regards coordination , supervision , and certain new mechanisms that must be put in place .
There is also the whole problem of financial regulation , of which some people have rightly reminded us .
We will assess the situation .
That is why many Member States , including the Dutch Parliament , have demanded that the International Monetary Fund intervene .
Therefore , it is certainly not a government in the constitutional sense of the word .
There is the climate challenge , for which there is the Copenhagen Accord , but the promises made in terms of reducing CO2 emissions are not enough to meet the few objectives that were laid down in the Copenhagen Accord - in other words , the objective to ensure that the temperature does not exceed the pre-industrial level by more than two degrees .
It is the very first time the fight against poverty has been included in five key objectives , and yet we are told that it is a disgrace , that we have not gone far enough and that we must take a resit .
Firstly , I would like to know how the right to defence is exercised when it is not just one air carrier that is banned , but all the air carriers of a state .
We highlight having a policy designed within the framework of a single European sea , and the importance ascribed to the multimodal linking of European sea ports with the hinterland .
Otherwise , all of our good intentions on safety , on job creation , are doomed .
Indeed , our farmers and the European agri-food industry must not be penalised at a time when they are incurring additional costs to meet EU requirements .
I believe we need to change direction .
Meanwhile , the proposed financial support mechanism for Greece was finally put in place on 11 April .
The Commission believes that the legislative authority will come round to our common objective , which is to ensure that the new European supervisory architecture for the financial sector becomes fully operational from the beginning of next year .
Bringing the single market into the 21st century is a priority for the Commission , which will make new proposals by 2012 .
The achievements until now have been impressive but we need , more than ever in this period of exit from the crisis , to promote and defend European values and indeed , above all , to tap all the potential that is now created by the Lisbon Treaty .
In this , we will set out what we see as the key principles and parameters for using the European Union 's financial resources to best effect , taking full account of the Europe 2020 strategy .
Recent years have shown that strategic blueprints cannot be cast in stone - they have to adapt to reality on the ground .
We urgently need budgetary , economic and industrial coordination .
The first Commission of which I had the honour of being President presented a specific regulation aimed at giving greater audit powers to Eurostat , and that was rejected by certain Member States , which did not want the Commission to be able to play that role .
I have seen today in the press - and not only in the Eurosceptic or Europhobe press , not only in the tabloids , but also in the quality press - that the European Union now admits that it was mistaken in deciding to suspend flights .
We need to create new sources of growth in order to successfully tackle our biggest problem , which we shall be discussing this afternoon , namely , unemployment and , more specifically , youth unemployment .
Third , Haiti 's development will have to be assessed on the basis of criteria of relevance , effectiveness , efficiency and sustainability .
We owe the country a duty of effective solidarity at the same time as respect for its economic and political sovereignty : the economic and political sovereignty of the people of Haiti .
Let us also be clear from the point of view of the Commission .
In March , a European Parliament resolution told you to scale down the ACTA negotiations on counterfeiting .
I am very much in favour of the European Parliament 's role being strengthened in this area as well , and the text to be made public tomorrow , for which we had to obtain permission from our negotiating partners , is the text of the negotiations , the draft negotiation text .
Respect for the political , social , environmental and cultural rights of indigenous populations must be at the heart of our transatlantic relations .
The regulation of which I speak introduced a system of compulsory registration for all credit rating agencies established on European Union territory .
I have mentioned the new requirements that will be imposed on credit rating agencies and I have spoken about the latest progress that will be made on the proposal that I shall put to you , in accordance with your wishes , for supervision by the European Securities and Markets Authority ( ESMA ) .
This agency , if I have understood his idea properly , should be public .
This body will allow us to ensure the consistency that is
