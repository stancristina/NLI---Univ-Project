I should like to know why we are so far behind with our schedule .
I should like to know when I can now expect it to be dealt with .
Mr President , to the strains of the mantra of closeness to the people , we are now planning even more Union .
A new theme , a common tax policy , is on its way , and the Cologne summit will put a proposal for a fourth pillar , common armed forces , on the agenda .
Externally , we shall have a strong statesman to represent the Union .
We are in the middle of the construction of a new superpower , a USA in Europe , but without American democracy .
It is now time to sound the alarm over these plans and to prevent nationless Eurocrats , civil servants and ministers from creating an EU state without democracy .
I would rather see a much more specific timetable for enlargement than the timetables now established for the currency , the armed forces and the police - a timetable for more power to the Union .
I am still very sceptical as to whether harmonisation is necessary , and I strongly object to the fact that the present directive represents a deterioration of consumer rights in several countries , including Denmark , where it directly undermines the provisions of the Danish Sale of Goods Act .
We should focus on the rights of European consumers , instead of concentrating on how the EU can stimulate people 's willingness to make purchases when they visit other Member States .
A number of the directive 's provisions should be removed in order to protect consumers .
The basic shortcoming of this directive is that it only concerns the relationship between the consumer and the seller , and does not include the liability of earlier links in the chain of sales of faulty products .
Consumer considerations should always have top priority .
I do , of course , support the amendments in the report which attempt to rectify the shortcomings and ambiguities , but they are not enough , and unfortunately I cannot support the proposal as a whole .
Mr President , our group 's spokesman , Mr Eisma , is unable to be present here today , so I shall speak on his behalf .
But I shall also begin on his behalf by commending the rapporteur , who has proposed some important amendments on behalf of the committee .
The voluntary agreement entails a reduction in emissions to 140 g of CO2 per km in 2008 .
Parliament has always believed that it should be 90 g per km in order to be able to meet the Kyoto targets .
At most this is a reduction of 25 % , but much more is needed when , at the same time , we know the greatest challenge for the environment in the coming years will be the development of transport .
I shall conclude , Mr President , by saying that voluntary agreements can be excellent , and that we would also like to commend the vehicle industry , but we also know that for these agreements to be successful , it is very important to have measurements and sanctions , if they are to succeed in the long run .
Mr President , although as many speakers have mentioned , a great deal has been done at international level over recent decades , there is still a long way to go .
This proposal is a step in the right direction .
One of the things we unfortunately cannot get to grips with in the European Union is the possibilities of taxation - and I think the Commission agrees with me when I say unfortunately , because that is a very effective way of modifying behaviour .
This shows what it is all about .
I would like to thank the rapporteur for the work she has put into the report and say that our group is voting in favour of the amendments which tighten up the legislation .
I can understand very well the rapporteur 's compromise proposal with the PPE Group .
Like the rapporteur , I would also have thought it was a good idea , but like my group , I am now in favour of having tougher regulations .
This has already happened , for example , in greenhouses in the northern countries , and there are no problems with using the alternatives .
Parliament has constantly struggled to gain more power , while at the same time it has failed in its supervisory function , which is the only function it should attend to .
Parliament has 'cried wolf ' so many times that it shares some of the blame for the fact that the Commission believed it could do whatever it liked .
And in what Mr Santer has said there is still no question of accepting responsibility for what has happened in the past .
Our electorate must be able to demand that of us .
Mr President , after having listened to Mr Wolf , I should like to begin by recounting a practical experience which I had at a wood products plant at Tartu in Estonia .
The head of the plant said to me : ' Why do I have to label all my furniture for Ikea in Germany with some strange ' E 's ?
Why do my standards have to be inspected ?
You see , that is how it appears in practice .
These agreements which we are going to adopt are a signal to the populations of the countries concerned that we have not forgotten them and that we are continuing to work on precisely the problems which I encountered in Tartu .
The trade which is also sought by Mr Wolf does not just come of itself .
I am thinking in particular
