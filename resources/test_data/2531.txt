from fulfilling the euphoric proclamations of the Lisbon Summit of March 2000 on full employment and on making the Union the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010 .
By accentuating the unilateral approach to the liberalisation and greater flexibility of the goods , services , capital and labour force markets , ignoring economic and social cohesion , the Commission and the Council are contributing to increasingly significant social problems and to hampering economic recovery .
We cannot , however , resolve Kyoto merely through industry and energy .
This attempt to provide a new boost , to be decided on at the Spring Council and which has come about in response to the failure of this model , proves that there is no such thing as a new or old economy ; there is only economic rationality .
I also believe that the Council 's request to the Member States to formulate and develop EU standards and codes of conduct for practical application in encouraging the establishment of open e-marketplaces , secure e-business solutions , e-signatures and electronic payment systems is extremely important .
The Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism was right to frame the Austrian problem in a broader , European context , which applies to all Alpine regions , laying down a uniform approach , which also respects the environment in other strategic Alpine hubs .

The profusion of information held by States should be accessible to everyone , with the proper safeguards for information that is of strategic importance or in the national interest and in line with the rules of the prevailing culture .
( PT ) The directive proposed by the European Commission on which we have voted today aims to harmonise Member State legislation on third-country nationals with regard to migration for the purpose of employment .
( Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137( 1 ) of the Rules of Procedure )
This has led to the gap between the richest and poorest countries growing , to encompass a further 100 million poor people .
I believe that by seeking to harmonise all regulatory material concerning immigration for the purpose of employment , the Commission 's proposal far exceeds any possible grammatical , logical , systematic or teleological interpretation of these rules , in flagrant breach of the principle of subsidiarity .
.
Hence our opposition to any agricultural negotiations within the WTO , which has been giving a further boost to the concentration , intensification and verticalisation of production and in this way , to the elimination of thousands of small and medium-sized holdings , in particular in Portugal .
I should also like to point out that the safety of transport cannot be made conditional on its profitability and that , where the safety of road transport is concerned , I fully share the aim laid down by the Commission to achieve a 50 % reduction in the number of road deaths by 2010 , ( totalling 20 000 ) and I support the proposal for the Community-level implementation of evidence-based measures that will enable this target to be achieved .
Furthermore , I think that the European Transport Fund , another of the measures proposed , is an important pillar for the proper development of infrastructures for roads , railways , maritime routes , river and sea ports and airports , in the aim of creating a European network of balanced and sustainable infrastructures .
Firstly because of the distant horizon of 2010 , the deadline set by the Commission White Paper is directed and secondly , in light of the practical difficulties of implementing a very broad range of measures with meagre resources .
( PT ) I have voted in favour of this report , and I agree , therefore , with the conclusions reached by the competent parliamentary committee on its content .
( PT ) This resolution on preparations for the 2003 Spring Summit , which highlights the urgent need to re-establish credibility and to implement the Lisbon Strategy in order to improve the European Union 's economic and social model by 2010 , warrants support despite the fact that Europe 's current political and economic climate is substantially less favourable than the climate that served as backdrop to the Lisbon European Council of 2000 .
We must furthermore improve the system of the mutual recognition of qualifications , in order to encourage greater and better mobility .
Nevertheless , recent events that have led to a crisis in NATO and to the danger of a veto in the Security Council by Member States of the Union pose a serious risk to the unity of Europe .
It would be extremely bad if these countries ' freedom to take political decisions suffered because they do not agree with some , and I repeat some , countries of the European Union .
This debate must also be seen in the context of the forthcoming enlargement and of the work of the Convention on the Future of Europe .
The European Union has demonstrated its ability to respond to the terrorist threat by adopting two important instruments : the European arrest warrant and the framework decision on combating terrorism .
This progress must of course be assessed in light of the timetable and programmes for measures established at Tampere .
I would also add the initiative that the Commission will be adopting next month to present a communication focusing on the issue of integrating third-country nationals into European reception societies .
With regard to the relationship between the Commission and the European Parliament , the Commission is attempting scrupulously to comply with the framework agreement signed by the two institutions on 5 July 2000 .
