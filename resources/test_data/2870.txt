s decision to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol is an indication of his immense lack of responsibility regarding the future of humanity .
The USA produces per head of population more than ten times the amount that would represent sustainable development if that were the average figure for everyone on earth .
The unilateral decision taken by the American President will tend to have an adverse effect on dialogue on either side of the Atlantic .
However , in any event , the European Union must keep to its obligations .
There is no economic justification either for abandoning the aims and obligations of Kyoto .
Having familiarised myself with these precedents , I could not help but come to the conclusion that there were two suitable precedents for concluding that the request to waive Mr Berlusconi' s parliamentary immunity should have been made in plenary immediately after last summer ' s recess , and referred to the Committee on Legal Affairs for deliberation .
I had the impression that the last argument you put forward , Madam President , was that the requests in question had come from the Spanish Supreme Court through Parliament ' s Information Office .
Consequently , I can only state that it is the opinion of my group that there was every justification for announcing this request to waive parliamentary immunity in plenary without delay , and referring it to the Committee on Legal Affairs for deliberation .
( Applause from the Verts/ALE Group )
Mr. Voggenhuber himself hopes his parliamentary immunity might be waived , as he has very persuasively shown our group that this is a matter of standing up for freedom of speech , which is something he wishes to be involved in .
This does by no means imply that we should question the principles adhered to by the Committee on Legal Affairs or the fact that it should stand to its principles , but in this case we consider that there are good reasons why Parliament can best safeguard its own independence by accepting this challenge Mr Heider has issued to Mr Voggenhuber .
( FI ) Mr President , in the debate on transparency it is worth stating right away that we are not starting from scratch , as rules on public access to information have been in force in the institutions of the European Union since around 1993 .
For this thanks go to all those active NGOs and individuals that have refused to believe that the institutions can deny them access to certain documents , and that have sought to appeal against such negative decisions .
The European Parliament should have insisted on using its powers to repair the defects of this compromise .
First of all , it is worth mentioning that these talks during the Swedish Presidency have been going on in camera .
The European Parliament should really be very careful about when it becomes involved in an accelerated codecision procedure such as this , as it tends to forsake the issue of transparency to a considerable degree .
With regard to restrictions on time , it is a fact that the institutions - including Parliament - wasted quite a lot of time , which could have been successfully spent in the successive stages of the codecision procedure , where Parliament often makes considerable gains towards the end .
I therefore believe we would easily have been able to continue .
This one possibly has a rather ugly face : perhaps it should have a more beautiful one as we are talking about transparency .
This is just how these rules work .
Inside the regulation on transparency there is also a sort of shadow regulation that the Council has managed to smuggle in , saying that there is a whole pile of documents labelled as 'sensitive ' , which are covered by quite separate rules from those we have written into the paragraphs of the Article relating to transparency .
And , at the end , who do we find but Mr Solana himself !
For that we would have required rather more time , rather more transparency and some measure of public debate .
The committee adopted the two amendments , the first of which was originally a joint proposal by Professor Trakatellis and myself .
It is naturally in the interests of the EU as a whole that diseases , including TSEs , are confined to as small an area as possible and prevented from spreading to new areas .
In our examination of individual rules on the prevention and control of TSE , it becomes ever more apparent that the whole common agricultural policy needs to be reformed , which is to say , certain steps need to be taken to amend it .
Such a model would permit national aid to be granted mainly to promote food safety , environmental cleanliness and the aims of regional policies .
Article 33 of the Treaty is still based on this approach , even though the EU achieved self-sufficiency back in the 1960s and production has exceeded demand since the 1970s .
Mr President , Commissioner , we want the EU in ten years ' time to be the world ' s most competitive economy , with nobody being excluded .
Good social policy will not prevent exclusion if the issues of equality of education and its high quality are ignored .
Investing in education and its availability will mean that the human resources that exist will be made effective use of .
At the same time , education should help young people and adults too to discover their strengths and to achieve success .
A follow up report is to be presented at the European Council meeting in spring 2002 .
We are , however , sorry that Parliament has been passed over in the preparatory work until now .
