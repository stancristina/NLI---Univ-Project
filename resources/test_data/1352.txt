common rules are important and necessary , and there are therefore clear rules about this in the Treaty .
As for a common EU policy on residential homes , however , my response is no thank you .
Mr President , I might well continue where my fellow MEP , Mrs Theorin , left off .
Women 's rights and legal position are among these things .
Others are international law and human rights .
When the talk turns to Afghanistan , I find myself thinking automatically of those people , including European citizens , who are imprisoned in Guant√°namo .
What legal system do they come under ?
The United States does not respect international law - of that we are well aware - but nor does it respect its own law .
I also find this in stark contrast to the fact that , in other situations , there is a demand that international law be complied with .
In that way , we give people the impression - in Afghanistan too - that there are two standards in this world , namely that which we demand that they themselves uphold and that which we , for our part , are willing to uphold , because it is we who have the power and thus , in our view , also the right to make demands .
There is quite a lot to suggest that there were American soldiers present .
There is much , however , to suggest that they were present .
That being said , we are doing nothing to have this matter thoroughly investigated and have the people responsible brought to trial .
I think these double standards are causing us problems .
I certainly also enjoyed working into the night with Dagmar .
There were a number of Member States and also parts of industry that did everything to block decent rules concerning animal experiments .
The first of these was in relation to animal experiments .
Where most experiments are concerned , the ban will apply in six years ' time ; but , unfortunately , the bans on three areas , or methods , of experimentation will only apply in ten years ' time , and then with a risk of the deadline 's also being extended .
That is also what we have said here in Parliament but , as we know from the negotiations , there were some Member States that simply blocked the experiments concerned being halted more quickly .
It is now crucial that the Commission be consistent in following up the issue .
I am able fully to endorse Mr Davies 's observation .
There has most definitely been an acceptance of laxity in developing alternative methods , and that laxity must cease with this directive .
First and foremost , we are obtaining a ban on the use of a range of carcinogenic substances and on the use of substances that impair our reproductive ability .
I believe that , overall , there has been a breakthrough in relation to unnecessary animal experiments and that there has also been a breakthrough in terms of public health and consumer protection in the cosmetics area .
I also believe that it is necessary for ourselves in Parliament to monitor such follow-up from the sidelines .
Madam President , current policy whereby industry has been given time to develop alternative methods of experimentation has not produced results .
Animals should not suffer through its being possible to develop new vanity products .
I should therefore like to congratulate Mrs Roth-Behrendt on the outcome of what will soon have been a long fight .
Even if the conciliation text turned out not to be as restrictive as Parliament had wished , it contains the right principles .
All substances , including those in category 3 , must be covered .
The conciliation text is along the right lines , however , so I would once again congratulate you on your worthwhile struggle , Dagmar .
We are against the EU 's having influence in this area , since it should be up to the Member States themselves to decide on these matters .
The proposal contains quite a number of useful features for improving immigration and asylum policy in the EU.
We are nonetheless aware of the fact that this area includes states of affairs covered by Title IV of the EC Treaty and not relevant to Denmark , cf . the Protocol on Denmark 's Position .
Moreover , respect for human rights must be , and remain , its indispensable point of departure .
The June Movement is also voting in favour of the whole report , because human rights within the EU must naturally be respected , if not improved .
The June Movement endeavours to support and improve the human rights situation both within and outside the EU.
The proposal includes quite a few useful features , but we do not believe that the time is ripe for setting up a joint Corps of Border Guards .
Mr President , Mr Markov 's excellent report creates the impression that the Bank really is a great success .
It has been successful at investing - in nuclear safety , for example - in the candidate countries and in the former Soviet republics .
That is also something for which there is certainly a need .
Think of the Chernobyl disaster .
The Bank is responsible for the fund to be used for decommissioning the Ignalina power station in Lithuania .
At the Copenhagen Summit , Lithuania promised to shut down Ignalina in 2009 .
A proposal has just been put forward for an investment package that would put some order into the method used for storing nuclear waste .
It is a huge mess and , in the longer term , extremely dangerous .
I would therefore call for the package to be adopted as quickly as possible .
