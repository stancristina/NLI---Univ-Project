In the list of renewable energy sources , peat has not yet been mentioned .
Far too little money has been devoted to the ALTENER programme .
The security of the EU must also be considered .
By 2020 , 94 % of the quantity of oil needed in the EU will be imported , as well as 80 % of the coal and 75 % of the gas .
Is it really the case that there were not enough suitable applicants , or do you not know how to get them ?
I would also like to ask how you intend to guarantee that this so-called glass ceiling is shattered and that women are not restricted to lower levels in the administrative hierarchy ?
His time perspective was a realistic one , and remains so .
I fear that many countries , which are much closer to possible accession than Turkey , were given the impression years ago , from many quarters - and I do not mean Parliament , but government representatives - that full membership for the Baltic Countries , Poland and Hungary , for example , would be possible by the year 2002 or 2003 .
We must make one thing clear for ourselves , however .
In other words , we shall not exclude Turkey .
The use of peat is a bonus in Nordic energy policy .
For example , the Finnish marshes are an important natural resource , and peat bricks meet approximately 7 % of Finland ' s energy requirements . 6,500 people derive their livelihood either directly or indirectly from peat production .
In fact , peat is a natural renewable resource whose cycle for regeneration is longer than that of wood .
Without the parallel use of peat , the volume of planned wood-burning boilers will not be sufficient nor will the operation be lucrative .
Of all the important issues on the agenda for the talks , the liberalisation of trade in services is the most challenging .
The European Union is the world ' s largest player in the field of trade in services .
One of the greatest barriers to free trade in services is the lack of any global set of norms relating to tendering for contracts in the public sector .
Similarly , we must substantially develop a scheme to gauge the international comparability of rules of copyright .
Any monitoring mechanisms used to check levels of quality must be clear as to their principles and as open as possible with regard to the communication of information .
Electronic shopping must clearly be made easier , and regulation and taxation in this area must be kept to a minimum .
At the talks we must be able to ensure that electronic shopping remains free and dynamic , and guarantee the possibilities for developments in electronic shopping in Europe in the next Millennium also .
Mr President , Members of the European Parliament , I would like to thank you for this opportunity to inform Parliament of the work of the Council and its views on climate policy .
Obviously , the more we allow the climate to change , the greater these effects will be .
Obviously , these have a direct effect on people ' s health .
It is also predicted that , as a result of warmer climates , many diseases spread by what are known as vectors , such as those spread by insects , will increase .
It is predicted , for example , that malaria may spread to southern parts of Europe and the United States .
This is just one example of the dramatic effects that climate change could bring with it .
It is important to realise that beyond the commitments of Kyoto , new commitments have to be made in order to sufficiently slow down climate change .
One is the Union ' s own action to reduce emissions , and the other is the work of the Union in international negotiations .
This means that new policy action is needed .
One of the most important objectives of the Finnish presidential term is to achieve first sector strategies for energy , transport and agriculture .
I believe it is important that a continuous process should emerge from these sector strategies , i .e . that we should not be content with the first versions but that at regular intervals sector strategies in the areas of transport and energy , for example , should be reviewed and targets should be set that are ever more ambitious .
Our aim is that , ideally , the Fifth Party Summit should produce a draft agreement , which will obviously have sluice-gates in it , but which will enable us to adhere to a timetable , thus making it possible to conclude the agreement at the Sixth Party Summit , meaning that progress in the Party Summit this autumn is essential .
We also have in the Development Council conclusions being drafted on the connection between climate policy and development policy .
So that the transfer of technology and resources to the less developed countries can start to work we need rules for the CDM.
But it is also important for the Union that the agreement on all three of the Kyoto flexibility mechanisms - the CDM , International Emissions Trading and Joint Implementation - make equal progress under the agreement .
Finally , I would like to say that the Commission ' s communication on preparations for the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol is a lucid document and a good start , but it mainly contains measures for the initial stage .
Mr President , on behalf of the Greens/European Free Alliance , I would like to welcome Madam President-in-Office of the Council and Mrs Wallström , of the Commission .
Mrs Wallström spoke of a very positive matter with regard to
