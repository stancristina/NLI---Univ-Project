I should like to thank the officials of the European Commission who , this time , have been excellent to collaborate with , together with the Presidency , which conducted a very constructive conciliation .
What , in practical terms , does the Presidency intend to do for small and medium-sized enterprises ?
That is also a very important issue .
Will you add the right for the consumer to know which dangerous chemicals the product contains ?
Let us talk about what needs , in actual fact , to be done .
That is not only the most important measure for strengthening European competitiveness , it is also the most important thing we can do to bring about the reunification of Europe and ensure that all European countries can experience growth , as well as relations unimpeded by borders .
A country that threatens to annihilate another country , that secretly develops nuclear fuel technology and that supports terrorism must be confronted by a common unified European policy in alliance with our international partners .
We therefore support the European Parliament’s resolution on the European Council’s common position from 15 to 16 December 2005 .
Parliament has the right of codecision on the financial perspective and has announced that it will push its own budget policy very hard .
I am certainly very disappointed in the Council’s agreement whereby my priority areas will obtain resources fewer than those proposed by the Commission .
It is especially important for the ten new Member States .
Certainly , Parliament has the right of codecision on the issue and is entitled to reject the Council’s proposal , but it would be unfortunate if the long-term budget were not to materialise because of power games between the institutions .
Parliament must now assume its responsibility and , together with the Council , do its best to arrive at a long-term budget .
Parliament wishes to allocate more money to important areas , but advocates an unduly high total level of expenditure and , like the Council , wishes to allocate too much money to agricultural expenditure and regional aid .
The report also vigorously rejects the proposals for further regulation that existed when Parliament debated the issue last time .
I do so on the basis that this is an issue to which subsidiarity applies , by which I mean that it should be dealt with at local or regional level in this case .
Firstly , it is simpler and , secondly , it contains improved health and environmental requirements .
That is regrettable .
We are confident that the Member States are able independently to deal with issues concerning water quality at bathing sites .
I voted in favour of the draft because the proposal significantly simplifies an earlier , 1976 directive on bathing water quality .
This is one such area , and it should be dealt with in places closer to the people .     We believe that the Århus Convention constitutes a valuable legal tool for guaranteeing public access to environmental information and public participation in decision-making processes .
We voted against the report and recommend that the Commission ’s proposal be rejected .
Political decisions on pilotage , unloading and self-handling must be taken at national level . – Under the proposal for a directive , employees doing the same jobs can belong to different union organisations .
That is absurd .
No one would come up with the idea of forcing Volvo to accept subcontractors they do not want .
That is also the way things work in the companies constituted by European ports .     We support Afghanistan’s development towards peace , stability and democracy following the fall of the Taliban regime .
Rather , that is the task of individual countries or defence organisations acting on a mandate from the United Nations , which should be given a better basis for taking military action in trouble spots around the world .
We also believe that the Member States should be able to adopt their own positions in connection with negotiations on international climate issues .
We are convinced that individual Member States can successfully take the measures required for giving the general public access to appropriate information on climate issues .
However , the report addresses a number of crucial political areas that should lie outside the EU’s competence .
Of that there can be no doubt .
They have , of their own accord , the audacity to interpret the results in terms of dissatisfaction with the governments in office in both countries .
The same applies to the United Kingdom , Austria , Sweden , Denmark and perhaps other countries too .
The first is to quote Mr Brok who , at the beginning of the debate , said that the citizens are the stakeholders .
Having so many times heard wry comments along the lines of ‘what is it in the “no” vote that you do not understand’ , I want to add that , in actual fact , opinion polls and interviews have told us precisely why people have come out in favour of , or voted against , the Constitutional Treaty .
Nor is there anything particularly odd about the fact that 25 Member States engaging in a debate about how we are to rise to the constitutional challenge posed by a Europe whose membership has grown from 15 to 25 countries should , in actual fact , wonder how we are to extricate ourselves from a situation in which two Member States have rejected the Constitutional Treaty while 14 have approved it .
How do we deal with that situation ?
You are making things rather too easy for yourselves .
However much you may laugh , all we can do is engage in debate and dialogue with people and to discuss factual matters before linking them to the constitutional
