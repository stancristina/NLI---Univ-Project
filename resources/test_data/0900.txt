Mr President , in the last few years the EU has , of course , been given more and more significant powers in the social area , but it has not been given an awful lot of money for solving social problems .
For these reasons , I believe that it is particularly important for those of us who work in the EU institutions to concentrate on according much greater importance than we have until now to the non-governmental public organisations in Europe operating in the social sphere .
Their worth lies precisely in the fact that they are non-governmental and civic and are able to see social problems from a different perspective than the authorities .
I propose that the Commission turn to the Council and the Member States to try to get them to contribute to such a fund .
I believe that if we set to work on a task like this with a certain diplomatic tactfulness , the Member States would react positively to the proposal .
( SV ) Mr President , as draftsperson of the opinion prepared by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy on the basis of the Hughes procedure , I am able to say on behalf of the whole Committee that we welcome the Danish initiative which , together with our amendments , was adopted unanimously in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .
I would point out that this Framework Decision is to be made unanimously in the Council , and it has been agreed that it will be binding upon the Member States .
At the same time , it should be remembered that it is the Member States which decide how the results are to be achieved , that is to say which method is to be applied and which course of action adopted .
That is extremely important .
More knowledge , pure and simple , about the environment and details of relevant techniques are also , of course , required , as well as information on how to detect environmental crime , on the consequences of this and on the penalties that can be imposed .
We have looked at this definition of serious environmental crime in the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .
Another important aspect is what is regarded as 'aggravating circumstances ' if the organisation which has caused serious environmental damage has been inadequately insured and has been so , too , in connection with the risks entailed in the particular business .
This Framework Decision is one step , like the Council of Europe ' s Convention on the Protection of the Environment through criminal law .
When we look at the Danish text , as well as at Mr Di Lello Finuoli' s report and Mrs Schörling ' s opinion , which are both excellent , we see , however , that it is an extremely complicated area .
It is important to have regulations in criminal law so that we can prevent environmental crime .
As Mrs Schörling also pointed out , we must have close cooperation , including when it comes to the rules relating to environmental liability which we are to draw up and which are mentioned in Article 2 ( a ) .
Why is the Commission so passive - much more passive than in many other areas - when it comes to being the Guardian of the Treaties on the issue of protecting animals in transit ?
I see this as a clear illustration of the current questions in Baia Mare and of the investigation which is under way there concerning who is really liable .
Who has misled whom ?
We should nonetheless be aware that , if we do this , we must also define what constitutes the type of serious environmental crime we are talking about combating .
In my own country , Sweden , a great many reports of environmental crimes are now being made .
These problems certainly exist in a number of Member States , and there are certainly many different reasons for this .
Major financial interests are often at stake .
Obviously , this is , in the first place , a responsibility of the Member States , and there should be international cooperation in this area .
The second reason is that , if this Danish initiative is implemented , it will facilitate pan-European environmental cooperation in the Council of Europe and perhaps enable this convention to be complied with .
Mr President , like everyone else , I want to join in the praise of the Danish Government which has taken this initiative .
It concerned a company which did not manage to deal with its poisonous waste but chose instead to bury it in the ground and in that way put a whole district at risk .
I agreed with the draftsperson of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , Mrs Schörling , that , in order to prevent environmental crime , we also need effective legislation governing environmental liability .
If these crimes are not detected quickly , they can remain unsolved or perhaps not have anything done about them at all .
Mr President , over a period of 150 years , missionaries and aid workers have fostered knowledge of international affairs and commitment in my own country amongst broad sections of the population .
History shows how , for example , a country such as Norway fought to conduct its own diplomacy in its struggle for independence from Sweden .
Mr Galeote Quecedo has done a very fine job , but I am sceptical about the following points : recital E concerning the establishment of a professional and permanent community diplomatic service ; and recital P in which there is talk of setting
