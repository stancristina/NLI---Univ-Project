improve its system of appointing the country 's judges and supreme judicial bodies in order to satisfy the criterion and fundamental principle of the separation of powers and , above all , that it will have to stop whale hunting prior to membership .
We are now living in a different world , Mr President , a multipolar world in which Europe must have its say or else these issues will not be discussed .
We know that the situation in Europe is not the same .
Furthermore , we will have to examine the issue not only of which platforms are currently in operation , but also of which ones are no longer in use and will eventually have to be decommissioned .
I am thinking in particular about what is happening at this very moment , and has been happening for a long time , in Nigeria .
Then , of course , it will be necessary to revise and review all the regulations relating to liability and the mechanisms for intervening in the event of a disaster .
As you know , Commissioner , we are awaiting the first results of the assessment of the Energy Efficiency Action Plan so that we can start work on a second , highly ambitious , plan as soon as possible .
I think that , beyond its very important technical contents , this report is already a very good instrument for communicating information about the common agricultural policy , about what it has been until now , about the need for such a policy in the future and about the need for this policy to evolve .
In order to ensure better management of the resources and means at our disposal under the common agricultural policy , I think that we need these two pillars , which must , of course , be complementary and which must have more clearly defined objectives .
These imports from Brazil and Argentina monopolise more than 19 million hectares .
Beef imports will increase by 70 % , poultry imports by 25 % .
Back then we had already reached a 'final limit' , and so to exceed it would be to kill our agriculture .
Firstly , the preservation by the European Union of significant tariff protection for fishery and aquaculture products , so that the preferences granted to certain third countries , in particular developing countries , still mean something , and so that the WTO mechanisms are still effective in ensuring that our processing industry receives supplies .
We therefore actively defend much stronger integration of social and environmental criteria into trade agreements regarding fishery products .
Today , the terms of this agreement have been considerably improved , in the interest of European citizens .
More protection will therefore be afforded to the rights of individuals , whilst acknowledging the importance of tracking financial data in the fight against terrorism .
However , whilst there has been ample progress , this accord is not perfect and there are also numerous flaws .
The European External Action Service ( EEAS ) represents considerable progress in this respect .
I shall vote against this text .
Moreover , I have too much respect for the inhabitants of that province to want them to have to apply the Copenhagen criteria in addition to suffering the consequences of the recent conflicts .
Instruments should therefore be introduced to help re-establish security in Kyrgyzstan .
It is therefore essential to take the necessary measures so that the countries that have not yet ratified the Convention do so .
The global organisation of agricultural markets needs to be rethought , taking into account the two main inspirations of a common agricultural policy : guaranteeing food safety and saving the lifeblood of small farmers and their families , both at home and in the world 's poorest countries .
The main priorities of European agriculture , such as food security , market regulation and spatial planning , are clearly reaffirmed , as are the consequences in budgetary terms , which must be in line with the ambitions of the CAP.
In this way , European fishermen would be protected by a reasonable and flexible tariff as well as by an ecolabel .
Parliament is calling for his release and for Zimbabwe to respect political rights and fundamental freedoms , in order to allow civil society to express itself without fear .
Can you tell us what the position of the European Union will be in St Petersburg ?
This time , there is no reason why the vote on this report should be postponed other than to simply allow certain parties , certain political groups , to reach a consensus .
The latter will have guaranteed access to evidence and be given the resources necessary to determine the causes of an accident .
This repository will be analysed so that preventive measures can be taken and accidents therefore prevented .
However , it must be able to access the information necessary for it to undertake certification tasks and offer the benefit of its expertise to the safety investigation .
Why ?
Secondly , 11 agreements have so far been adopted , and we have entered into negotiations on seven others .
How could we reasonably and in all conscience approve this agreement if we have not seen any assessment ?
I find it difficult to hide several regrets : the lack of responsiveness on the part of the Council and of the Commission despite the need for urgent action ; the regret that Soil Directive IV is still being blocked by the Council ; the regret that bio-conditionality of all public financing was rejected by just one vote in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety ; and the regret that the challenges associated with biodiversity have not been more extensively incorporated in the EU 2020 strategy , so as to ensure a sustainable exit from the crisis through the greening of our economic model .
