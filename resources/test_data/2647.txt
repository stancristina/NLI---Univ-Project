Does the Presidency believe it is a good thing that the Commission and the Council should have arrived at different conclusions regarding Portugal 's and Germany 's budget deficits ?
Is it laudable that different assessments have been made ?
How do you view the Stability Pact 's credibility in the light of the euro 's having become weaker as a world currency , especially against the dollar , in relation to which it has fallen from 1.30 to 0.90 ?
In our view , the amendments tabled represent , in general , an out-of-date agricultural policy which does not meet the conditions and needs of modern global society .
This process has been justified on the grounds that the sector is an important source of employment in parts of the Mediterranean region .
Instead , the Commission should conclude its analysis of how competitive production is ( while the present support system is extended by a year in accordance with the Commission 's proposal ) and then decide as to the consequences .
In the light of this , and with a view to the impending general review of the EU 's agricultural policy , we have chosen to vote against the report in its entirety .
The high levels of subsidy militate against conversion to other crops .
We believe that a change of this kind can , in itself , be made while retaining the existing decision-making models and institutional structure .
I cannot vote in favour of Mr Carnero Gonz√°lez ' report for the following reason , among others : I am in favour of intergovernmental cooperation , while the report is clearly supranational in character .
Mr President , this debate is about Taiwan and the WHO , and all the political groups are agreed that we wish to give Taiwan the opportunity to participate as an observer at the Geneva Summit in a few weeks ' time .
Many valuable lessons have been learned in Taiwan , and there is a great willingness to be of help , both economically and in terms of sharing knowledge .
We view what has been happening there with a very great deal of sympathy and support the Taiwanese people 's right to decide their own future .
A few months ago , we invited President Chen Shui-bian here to award him the Liberal International Freedom Prize , but the French authorities would not give him a visa .
Last week , we invited him to Sweden under a private arrangement , and he was not given a visa for my country either .
It should go without saying that a democratically elected leader should be given a visa when , for example , he receives an invitation from his Liberal colleagues .
Freedom of expression is non-existent .
It is worrying that so many African leaders have tried to explain away what has been happening in Zimbabwe and maintained that the elections were fair .
We waited far too long before taking action against Zimbabwe .
For example , tens of thousands of women have suffered degradation within the so-called sex industry in Western Europe .
Those who are standing up for a multiparty system and for democracy in Moldavia deserve our esteem and encouragement .
We do not want it also to become poor in terms of democracy .
Sometimes the infringements appear to pass unnoticed .
Now , there is cause to do so again .
The Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party is very concerned about the proceedings against Hamma Hammami and his colleagues in the banned Communist Party .
Even in my own country , where Tunisia is rarely mentioned , there have been a number of indignant press articles in the last few days about the way in which the members of the Tunisian Communist Party are being treated .
We are agreed that they are prisoners of conscience who must be treated decently and in a manner appropriate to a constitutional state .
The EU must address the issues of Tunisia and of human rights in the Association Agreements and in the context of cooperation .
Human rights issues must be highlighted in our continued contacts with Tunisia .
Mr President , I am a firm believer in the Lisbon strategy because it consists of a great many different policy areas that have to be coordinated .
My second anxiety was as to whether the sustainable development strategy would be given enough space in the document .
When it comes to the proposals on sustainable development , I have to state however that these are insubstantial .
The ecological aspects will clearly disappear in the future .
Seen in relation to what the Commission proposed , the fight against poverty is being undermined .
At present , all the institutions issue their guidelines in the spring , and the hope now exists that the Commission will also base its draft budget on ideas from the Council and Parliament .
If so , that would be a clear improvement .
It is especially in the sphere of foreign policy that a variety of promises are given .
It is therefore a source of deep concern to us to learn now that discussions of the new budget regulation , designed to reduce Parliament 's influence , are being held within the Council .
It is gratifying that all the institutions are now highlighting enlargement , which is of course the most important task for our time .
Finally , I hope that , before the negotiations are completed , the Council and the Commission will also institute an exhaustive discussion with Parliament concerning the long-term economic consequences of enlargement .
- ( SV ) I have abstained from voting in the final vote on the resolution , which was adopted by 211 votes to 58 , with 34 abstentions .
As a Swedish Christian Democrat , I object to that development .
Two days ago , they manifested
