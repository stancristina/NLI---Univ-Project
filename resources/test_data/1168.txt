2008 .
I have a problem .
Through what we have written today , we are therefore doing ourselves a disservice .
Perhaps I shall not need all this time .
We can therefore feel a certain optimism , even though history has all too often shown us that peace is fragile , especially in the Western Balkans .
Last week ' s election in Kosovo was conducted impeccably .
It felt like a privilege to be present at this historic event as an observer from the European Parliament .
The most important thing of all is , perhaps , to bring about a genuine process of reconciliation through which the ethnic cleansing that has taken place in large parts of these countries can be got to grips with and solutions found to the serious outstanding problems involving refugees and displaced persons .
The decision was taken against the background of the war in Kosovo because this crisis gave rise to large costs in Macedonia , to which hundreds of thousands of people fled .
The conflict has , of course , also given rise to further problems and caused delays in making the assistance available .
However , the Commission also proposes an increased financial contribution because there are beginning to be problems with Macedonia , where developments have otherwise been positive .
Nonetheless , we have tabled a number of amendments in order to emphasise that this aid must be administered by the Commission , but in close consultation with both the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
In May 1999 , we decided to provide the assistance in question , comprising a loan of EUR 20 million and contributions of up to EUR 40 million .
In this assessment , we must also take account of the fact that the elections held in Bosnia in November 2000 led to everything ' s having taken an extremely long time , what with negotiations and the High Representative ' s having had to intervene etc .
When it comes to the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , the same conditions must , nonetheless , apply in this case , as apply in the case of Macedonia .
This year , it has emerged that the economic situation has , perhaps , been a little more strained than we had previously believed .
We should , therefore , bear in mind that Yugoslavia now already has major debts amounting to more than 140 per cent of GDP.
In all these three cases , we also believe that , in order to produce new resources during the current budget year , ordinary budget procedure must be followed .
This can only be done by means of a parallel process involving a transfer of funds from other budget items , something which requires a decision on the part of the budgetary authority .
So that we , too , could see where the funds were to be taken from , we wanted , first of all , to see the Commission ' s practical proposals for transferring funds in such a way as to produce the necessary EUR 45 or 18 million .
At the same time , we jointly accept the Commission ' s preliminary draft budget for the Balkans , something which I also hope will be the result of the second budget reading during the next part-session in Strasbourg .
Moreover , this view is also confirmed by the Court of Auditors ' report .
Moreover , we wish to introduce a reference to Article 274 of the Treaty , in order to emphasise clearly that this is aid which the Commission and not , in the first place , the Member States have the responsibility for implementing .
This debate raises many ethical issues and possesses many ethical dimensions .
Are we signalling to the research community that it is hardly worth trying to carry out promising stem cell research in Europe ?
We must not , therefore , rule out embryonic stem cell research .
We should have liked to have seen the sixth framework programme for research support therapeutic cloning .
However , no one should have a monopoly on ethical issues .
In Parliament too , we must consider the matter in much greater depth than we were able to do in the temporary committee , particularly in terms of issues such as insurance , genetics and working conditions .
Today , we have elected to abstain in the vote on the report on the criminal-law protection of the Community ' s financial interests .
It is also vital that the Christian minority perceive the judiciary as impartial .
There is a risk of undermining the rule of law , particularly with the Commission ' s proposed definition of the term 'terrorism ' .
There is a need for terrorism to be defined more clearly than has so far been the case .
- ( SV ) Mr Fiori' s report adopts positions on many difficult issues regarding human genetics , including the ethical principles which ought to apply in this area .
It is impossible to make such a distinction , as therapeutic cloning is nothing other than the initial stages of reproductive cloning , with , from the beginning , a stated intention to destroy the embryo which develops from the substitution of the cell nucleus .
It is , therefore , my view that research using adult stem cells should be prioritised , while ethically highly controversial embryonic stem cell research should not be funded through the Framework Programme .
I have therefore chosen to support the report as it was presented prior to the reading in plenary , in line with my vote in favour of Mr Caudron ' s report on the sixth framework programme .
