Even if accession does not come about in 2003 it must take place as soon as possible , and we must make every effort to make it happen for we are in debt to those countries - the countries of Eastern Europe - which are as European as the countries of Western Europe and whose only crime , as the Commissioner himself pointed out , was to find themselves , through no fault of their own , on the wrong side of an artificial line across the middle of our continent .
Mr President , Commissioner , your rapporteur endorses the contents of the Commission ' s report on Slovenia and notes that the criticisms expressed in 1998 gave the Slovenian authorities a salutary shock , prompting them to speed up adoption of the measures necessary for accession to take place .
Slovenia supported the action of NATO and the Member States during the war in Kosovo and , considering the difficulty of making such a decision , this can be taken as evidence not only of the important role played by this country in the region but also of the convergence of its interests with those of the European Union .
There are only a few days to go before the Slovenian general elections .
Internal battles are being sparked off in the individual countries over these issues .
For our part , we must implement the institutional reforms and they , on their side , must carry out major internal reforms respecting the Copenhagen and other criteria .
As regard the transitional periods , I feel that we must be careful not to fall into the temptation to use them to reduce the impact of enlargement , thus detracting from the fact that the new countries belong to the European Union , in an endeavour to comply with the timetable we have set ourselves .
In actual fact , a major measure such as the Paulsen report ends up having the adverse effect of opening the market to production systems whose quality is not sufficient to comply fully with the limits and threshold values which we require .
This is the wording jointly agreed with those who tabled the three amendments of the Group of the European People 's Party and European Democrats .
I would like to echo the positive opinion expressed by my group regarding Mr Brok 's report , and emphasise the political priority which must be given to the European Union 's decision to enlarge , a priority which cannot be conditioned or diluted by any reasons other than the rigorous assessment of whether the candidate countries fulfil the criteria laid down by the Community acquis .
The policy of cohesion is , at present , necessary and will continue to be so with regard to a large number of regions which are currently classified as Objective 1 areas and which are to be removed from this category after enlargement .
We must henceforth seek out new types of measures and new tools to benefit all the areas which are lacking in infrastructures and service networks such as , for example , the south of Italy .
We are here - and this is right and proper - to assess economic , political and social criteria , but we must be careful not to empty of all significance an act which is in many respects inevitable and preordained .
I would like to take this opportunity to extend a greeting to the pensioners and elderly people of Estonia , in the hope that we will look after their interests once they join the European Union .
I feel that , out of all the States which have applied to join the Union , Poland is the one which most deserves our support and our commitment for , without Poland 's crucial initiatives , Communism would not have ended and we would not be discussing this issue today .
I would like to take this opportunity to express my hope that Slovakia 's accession to the European Union will alleviate the situation of Slovakian pensioners and elderly people , a situation which is extremely damaging to the interests of all the citizens , particularly the elderly , in that their pensions are not sufficient to provide an adequate standard of living .
Well done to the Hungarian Republic !
Mr President , I voted for the report on the current status of Romania 's application for membership of the European Union .
We must prevent any inclusion whatsoever of undesirable substances in animal feedingstuffs .
We have proposed a number of amendments to the Mann report , amendments which make some of the points referred to more democratic and more liberal and ensure that they advocate civil liberties .
We felt that the objectives relating to enhancing in-depth understanding of the issue and its new forms , scale and development and , most importantly , action supporting those who have to implement these good practices , were entirely convincing .
I would just like to highlight a point once and for all .
Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteurs , Mr Cashman , Mrs Lynne and Mr Thomas Mann , and congratulate them on their work on the reports on the anti-discrimination programme and equal treatment in employment and working conditions .
These categories represent 25 % of the Union 's population .
This is a potential which must not be underestimated and the integration of these categories could prove beneficial to the economy as well .
I would like to emphasise certain points which appear to be particularly important : making the code of conduct legally binding , actively working towards drawing up an international code of conduct on the transfer of arms , making implementation of the code of conduct more transparent - in order to better assess its effectiveness - for example , providing
