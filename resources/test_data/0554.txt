We need a criminal court with international jurisdiction , which can independently judge those accused of such atrocities .
Only with complete determination to implement the Rome Treaty will we be able to end the impunity of the perpetrators of these crimes and contribute to the deterrence and prevention of such crimes in the future .
As we have heard , 139 governments have signed the Rome Treaty yet sadly only 27 have ratified it .
Sixty such ratifications are needed for the Treaty to enter into force and for the Court to be set up .
Therefore I believe it is imperative that the Member States set an example .
Already Italy , France , Belgium , Luxembourg , Spain , Germany , Austria and Finland have notably and honourably ratified the Treaty .
It is now time for the remaining Member States of the Union to follow suit .
Cynicism is an easy option and I will not indulge in it .
I believe we should welcome the signing of the Treaty on 31 December by the United States of America and we should also welcome the Yugoslav Federation signing the Treaty on 19 December 2000 .
We must now call upon those parliaments to ratify the Treaty .
Nonetheless , at the same time we must urge all states to continue to support the work of the International Criminal Tribunals for Rwanda and former Yugoslavia .
History teaches us that we must never forget .
Therefore , look back across the last millennium .
Look now across the world as it is and remember that the price of freedom is eternal vigilance .
Future generations will never forgive us if we turn our minds away from those who have suffered such terrifying atrocities and who continue to suffer as I speak .
Words are not enough .
The time for action is now .
Sign the Rome Treaty on the ICC and thereby signal our commitment and our challenge to the rest of the world .
As co-author I urge the House and the Council to support this motion .
Mr President , I am grateful for the opportunity to speak for the Committee on Petitions .
This is not the only issue concerning legally resident third-country nationals where we have a problem concerning the appropriate legal base .
I am thinking , for example , of the extensions of the 1408/71 Regulation concerning the coordination of social security systems .
The Tampere Summit in 1999 spoke of according similar rights to third-country nationals as those enjoyed by EU citizens .
Yet we still have those who wish to view them as short-term travellers , rather than as people who have much contribute to the Union .
Otherwise why would our governments be so keen to encourage inward investment from American and Asian companies ?
We believe we need political coherence in our policy-making in this area .
The lack of such coherence partly explains the argument over the legal base .
The Committee on Petitions supports the view taken by the rapporteur , Mr Deprez , and thanks him for his diligence in this matter .
It was our committee 's view that we could reduce the number of such disagreements with the Council in future by reducing the number of individual national initiatives in this area and looking instead for Commission proposals which go through an initial vetting procedure .
I know that the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs has already raised this with the Swedish presidency and we must hope it bears fruit .
On the substantive issue , while being aware that not all Member States are involved in the Schengen Agreement , of course , it seemed to our committee that we should bring the rights of third-country nationals into line with those of citizens .
This is particularly important where partners , not parents as it says in my explanatory statement for some very strange reason , are affected by a different legal status , and we have had a number of petitions on these issues which we added to our opinion .
We felt it was also important to support the position of Mr Deprez , as the need for this proposal itself is more the result of bureaucratic delay than decision-making .
It is our hope and expectation also that the Committee on Petitions will automatically be asked for an opinion in good time on such issues in future .
Mr President , I absolutely agree with Mr Deprez .
This is a really important issue which goes to the whole heart of why we have the European Union .
The fundamental principles of the Union are freedom , respect for democracy , human rights , and if you remove freedom of movement , if you stigmatise people because they have applied for a visa or they hold a particular type of visa , I believe you undermine the fundamental principles of the Union .
That is why I welcome the broad thrust of Mr Deprez 's report .
It is a well-considered report and , as he said quite rightly , it is relevant to thousands of people .
But even if it was relevant to only one person , we would still be acting , I am afraid , years , decades , after the time when we should have acted .
It is , as he said , a means to achieve a goal and I welcome his legal basis of Article 62( 3 ) .
I share Mr Deprez 's concerns and his amendments afford freedom of movement for those awaiting a definitive visa .
I welcome his refinement of the French proposals .
There is a real need for these proposals .
We must treat people fairly and with dignity and remove the stigma of visa stays .
Some Member States will have reservations , but we
