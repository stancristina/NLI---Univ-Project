even independently of EU relations .
The position of the Kurdish language , the exclusion of the Kurds from political life , or at least the attempt to exclude them , is evidence of the fact that they do not want a political solution to this important conflict of nationalities .
Whether these problems concern weapons of mass destruction , human rights , poverty , religious conflicts or lack of democracy , it is vitally important for America and Europe to join forces .
Regrettably , it is precisely these elements that have been absent from the transatlantic partnership over the past few months .
After all , Syria and Iran are on the agenda ; is that not so , Commissioner Patten ?
Madam President , I think that everyone will agree that there is a need for a serious debate within the European Union , but also between the European Union and the United States , about the role of the security policy in transatlantic relations .
The EU must be committed to a wide range of security , conflict prevention being its key priority .
The report is very extensive and contains a lot of information and many recommendations .
There is far too much information to sum up in three minutes , but it is all in there for you to read up .
The findings of our mission have been widely discussed , both worldwide and within Nigeria .
If we realise that about half of all the states have electoral problems , this brings into focus the significance of the legal cases which are now being brought before the specially instituted election tribunals .
It should speak with one voice .
These components are common targets , common indicators , guidelines , common indicators , a summary report , national reports and recommendations .
Needless to say , this is a step , albeit a small one , in the right direction .
Our problem is not so much the fact that it is being applied , but the fact that Parliament has no , or very little , involvement in it .
I think that we have drawn up a sound report and I would thank all the members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , for they have made a marvellous contribution to this report .
If we pursue the open method of coordination - of which I am in favour , as also , in fact , is my group - a number of points should be addressed .
They want to be able to talk to Members of Parliament about things that are happening or arrangements that are being made and over which , at a given time , they lose any sense of control .
I believe it to be important for two reasons .
Nobody produced honest figures with regard to employment .
Member States will then start pooling this power .
This is of key importance and this is why this authorisation is so important .
Together we have followed a path that we think is the best for everyone who has to face , will have to face or has had to face the problem .
Same problem .
Interdisciplinary , multidisciplinary tackling of the problem leads to the best chances of cure and I think that every woman in the European Union has a right to this .
Member States will themselves certainly become better acquainted with their own weaknesses if they look across the border at others .
A lot of research is therefore needed to see what factors really do have an impact on breast cancer .
For a long time little attention was paid to this and we looked too much at the technical side of the disease .
We must also take into account that there are unacceptably large differences in the chances of survival , depending on whether you live in one country or another .
Various fellow Members , Mrs Boogerd among them , have pointed out that there are still many unresearched areas .
The same is true of diseases affecting men and I refer here in particular to prostate cancer .
Thirdly , the recording of comparable European data concerning the development of breast cancer is needed .
Such data may be an extra stimulus for more European research , especially into the causes of breast cancer .
Unfortunately , the same cannot be said of all German veterinarians .
We have all decided that the producer has primary responsibility for his products .
It is of course strange that we first decide to place general responsibility with the producers and that we are now , today , going to reverse it again .
On the contrary , it will be counterproductive , because it removes responsibility from farms .
Finally , I should like the meat sector to take a critical look at itself .
The Commission is demonstrating progressive insight , that is , you can increase the control of food and certainly of meat by placing greater responsibility with the people who have to carry out the control .
Mr President , it is not an oral amendment !
.
In northern Europe , on the other hand , most of the small farmers have already been 'cleared away ' , and public opinion regards the agricultural funds as a kind of bureaucracy , a waste of money and environmental pollution which must be brought to an end as soon as possible .
This is understandable , as there is unfortunately a major risk of more large groups of farmers going out of business .
He is now regarded as the leader of the Muslim Democrats , which is supposed to be roughly the same as Christian Democrats in other countries .
Before something like this is done by the Commission , I would like us to establish whether any of this is true , because we do not believe that this is a particularly important organisation
