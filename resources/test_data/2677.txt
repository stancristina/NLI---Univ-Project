the EU.
Matters relating to refugees and asylum are for us primarily matters of security and control .
Establishing human rights is one of the greatest challenges in the attempt to increase Russian prosperity and stability .
It is time we realised the European Parliament ' s idea of a monitoring body to be set up within the Commission to promote an efficient human rights policy and report on questions relating to human rights .
Mr President , it has been shown that the amount of nutrients in the open sea area in the Gulf of Finland and in the vicinity of the shore generally increase as one moves eastwards , which is a reflection of the impact Russia has on the nutrients of the Baltic .
No corresponding eastward growth in the amount of nutrients is discernible , but instead the areas with high levels of nutrients clearly point to local causes : agriculture , industry and the presence of summer cottages .
For this reason , many areas of inland water near the coast need revitalising .
For the protection of the Baltic we thus need on-going fine-tuning , with smaller-scale measures , which are also dealt with in Annexes III and IV of the Helsinki Convention now being discussed .
The harmonisation of environmental considerations , viable agriculture , policies on livelihood , recreation and , for example , enlargement in a manner that is sustainable for the Baltic area , will naturally be a great challenge , both administratively and politically .
We need a conscious attempt at coherence .
I would also like to believe that , if it works well , the northern dimension would provide a forum to which the EU will find it appropriate to invite other key players as well , for example from the Baltic region .
It would be natural for the EU to embark on closer talks with these countries .
In addition , and this is important , the states to sign the agreement are committed to action throughout the entire catchment area of the region , which considerably extends the impact of the agreement .
The Helsinki Convention has been a pioneer in the multilateral cooperation process among the Baltic countries .
The tradition of bustling interaction that existed in the Hanseatic era is thus being revived , and before long the Baltic Sea will be an internal sea of the Union .
The commitment in the Convention to protecting natural diversity is a necessary addition to the Convention on Fishing in the Baltic Sea .
The long-term aim on the whole could be to extend the Helsinki Convention to cover the whole of the Baltic region with the objective of applying in practice the principle of sustainable development .
Mr President , this directive on the marketing of forest reproductive material is really based on the merger of two earlier directives .
In addition , there has been considerable progress made in research and development over the decades and , for that reason too , it is naturally a good idea to review matters .
On account of all this , it is excellent that these reviews and adjustments are being undertaken .
The material in question has now been classified into four categories , whereas previously there were two .
Details relating to the area of provenance must also be defined on a map .
The Commission had proposed too tight a schedule and , for that reason , the entry into force of the directive has been postponed until 2003 , so that the Member States can revise legislation as called for by this directive .
The transition period for some countries was also taken into account and thus the period of transition was increased by a couple of years for those countries whose period of transition would otherwise have expired .
The possibility of utilising and exhausting stocks was a very important issue , as has been remarked upon in this report .
Similarly , this proposal also consider the health of plants and changes in their health .
If this is added I will be able to agree to it , as rapporteur .
Mr President , Commissioner , the most important step with regard to the future of the euro is the moment European citizens start handling euros physically .
We will try to facilitate the switch to the new currency in terms of cash by allowing the euro and national currencies to exist side by side for a few months .
It now appears that the European Central Bank is also gradually beginning to endorse this aim .
In many countries , the euro , with few exceptions , could be adopted within a short period of time .
For example , I would support the big bang model for Finland .
Our citizens must have the real feeling that the euro is of benefit to them , and not something that is going to make life difficult .
At present , there is a dearth of direct practical benefits , since , for example , developments in the euro zone as far as cross-border purchases and currency exchange services are concerned have not been to the satisfaction of the public .
Problems for special groups must be minimised .
What is essential for the public is not how long dual circulation lasts , but how long the banks will exchange former currencies for euros without charge .
As Member of Parliament of a country that has a Baltic coastline , I want to promote , in every way I can , the protection of the marine environment in the Baltic Sea area .
There are great differences between the parties to the agreement in the way they comply with the agreement on environmental protection .
This is partly owing to technical resources .
Monitoring by the authorities is not as efficiently organised as in the EU countries either .
