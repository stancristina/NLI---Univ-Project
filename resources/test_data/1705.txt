principle of subsidiarity .
The costs of maternity leave lasting 20 weeks on full pay , which is now being proposed , would go up in Finland from the current level of EUR 30 million to EUR 80 million .
From the perspective of equality , I also regard as worrying the dreaded scenario where women 's employment opportunities could , in fact , weaken if employers were saddled with the massive costs arising .
The European Union needs a coherent social policy .
The harmonisation of maternity leave systems is an important step towards a more social Europe .
This would increase maternity benefits in many EU countries .
Better maternity benefits also raise birth rates .
A period of maternity leave would no longer mean less income for women and , furthermore , full pay during maternity leave would increase women 's pension accrual .
I do appreciate that the volume of the contributions corresponds to the importance of the issues discussed .
I want to make a few comments , responses and remarks on the debate and reports , and I will begin with the international scene .
It is therefore essential that the G20 , first the ministerial meeting this week , and then the summit in two weeks , is able to pursue effective international policy coordination to rebalance global growth .
The European Union is working for a strong and stable international financial system in which exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals .
The reports prepared by Mrs Ber√®s and Mr Feio are important contributions to this effect , and the Commission 's legislative proposals , once adopted , will make a quantum leap towards a true and effectively functioning economic and monetary union .
We are in the midst of a fundamental reform of our own financial system and we need to keep up the momentum at the G20 as well .
The Commission has put forward a proposal , first of all , on a stability fee or a bank levy so that the private sector , the banking and financial sector , would and will participate towards the costs caused by the crisis and towards the resolution of future crises .
Secondly , the Commission wants the financial sector to play a part in covering the costs of the crisis and that is why the EU - and the Commission - are committed to pushing for a financial transaction tax at global level .
We have proposed a bank levy or stability fee ; we have raised the possibility of a financial activities tax as a source for own resources ; and thirdly , we are committed to pushing for a financial transaction tax at the global level .
There needs to be an accent on crisis prevention as well as on crisis resolution , because it is better to be safe than sorry .
Such a permanent mechanism must minimise moral hazard and provide incentives for the Member States to pursue a responsible fiscal policy and incentives for investors to pursue responsible lending practices .
Mr Schmidt proposed an amendment concerning voluntary participation of non-euro area Member States in the sanctions regime .
The Commission can accept and endorse this amendment , which aims at involving the non-euro area Member States in the sanctions regime on a voluntary basis .
So far , we have only seen the beginning .
This is really a matter of credibility for the European Union in terms of reinforcing economic governance , and I fully agree with you that it is indeed the Community method that makes the European Union work and deliver .
Anyway , let us demonstrate together once again that the Community method can deliver , and now it must deliver , the new system of economic governance , and let us thus complement the strong monetary union by a strong and effective economic union to make a real and complete economic and monetary union .
I voted in favour of maternity leave lasting 20 weeks .
In Finland , there is a viable system for maternity and parental leave .
Businesses alone should not be saddled with the financial burden of maternity leave : the public sector must unquestionably share the costs .
The position of women regarding pay is alarming .
The tragedy reigning in the North Caucasus has only deepened in recent years with pervasive human rights violations still affecting the daily lives of the communities in Chechnya , in Ossetia , Dagestan , North Ossetia and Kabardino-Balkaria .
The violence is far from over .
At least 17 people were injured , most of them civilians .
The families of victims in Beslan still do not know what exactly happened to their children and loved ones , how they died or where their bodies are .
People disappear even in the capital city , Moscow , or in St Petersburg , as has happened during the past year .
The EU should seek now to cooperate with the Council of Europe on the excellent report produced by Dick Marty on legal remedies for human rights violations in the North Caucasus .
Mr President , it is certainly appropriate that at least one representative of a Nordic state should take part in this debate on the programme for the promotion of energy efficiency .
There is quite a lot of snow too .
Of course , we cannot do anything about the forces of nature .
And in order to make use of these forms of energy , we need money for research ; there is also plenty of room for improvement as regards all the existing forms of energy .
We need to set more ambitious objectives and ensure that the old , wasteful sources of energy are modernized .
The SAVE programme is of great importance in all this improvement of energy efficiency , but in itself it does not help as much as it could
