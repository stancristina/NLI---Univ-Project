For obvious reasons it was felt necessary to establish more ambitious targets in areas such as illegal immigration , border control , the European arrest warrant , asylum and police and judicial cooperation , amongst others .
Mr President , in the short time I have left , I shall concentrate on the new terrorist threats , which require action at European level and solidarity at international level .
We know that its sources of funding are diverse and that this funding is often obtained under the guise of promoting respectable aims .
We believe that these developments do not necessarily mean that the Union 's procedures must all be produced or implemented in the same way .
The States appear to wish to compensate for their inability to establish policies that will provide a structure for the area of freedom , security and justice by putting forward a torrent of proposals based on their right of initiative .
Furthermore , in the areas covered by Title IV , we are still seeing a persistent imbalance , rightly condemned by the rapporteur , between the relative ease with which agreements are concluded on the repressive elements of controlling immigration and the ongoing inability to establish common policies in the field of asylum and regulating legal immigration , specifically in the field of civil rights and social integration .
On the other , much still remains to be done in order to achieve a practical and effective system for safeguarding citizens ' rights .
With regard to Europol and Eurojust , it is regrettable that there is still only an indirect democratic division of responsibility , which is fragmented and insufficiently limited .
We should all resist the temptation to reduce the debate on asylum and migration to a purely ideological debate .
This is not for ideological reasons .
The Commission made the proposal on a new Schengen information system .
This should include not only the illegal financing of terrorism , but also the 'legal ' financing of terrorism in the European Union , including offshore centres on its territory .
I do not want to anticipate the evolution of international events , but we have learned much from the experience in Kosovo .
I would like to pay my sincere respects to Parliament .
I would therefore ask you to have someone look into this matter .
This is why we must concern ourselves with the long-term effects of this ordnance , out of consideration in particular for the innocent victims and most frequently , those harmed by their effects after operations have ended .
Even without conclusive proof , it is a requisite of conscience to provide effective forms of support for victims and their families , whether or not they are military personnel , who have been affected after the end of a conflict and whose suffering could be related to unexploded ordnance or depleted uranium ammunition .
Consequently , taking account of the degree of efficiency and budgetary execution of the programme , which has always lacked further means , it becomes important to keep up actions to protect forests ( both actions against both pollution and fires ) included in the same Regulation , thereby honouring commitments , which will become redundant with the entry into force of the current regulation .
Every summer brings with it this national scourge and its consequences , which are tragic at various levels : economic , ecological , social and human .
I therefore warmly welcome the Forest Focus Programme , a Community initiative that will help to protect and value forests in Portugal and throughout the Community .
I also agree that this proposal must cover the commitments given in the Convention on Climate Change , which portrays forests as sinks full of greenhouse gases .
It is therefore hard to understand why this Commission proposal excludes the cofinancing of measures to prevent forest fires , measures that were previously funded under Regulation 2158/92 .
Tens of thousands of hectares burn down every year in Portugal and in other Mediterranean countries .
Four of them , from Mrs Montfort and Mr Mauro , deal with the specific and important question of the need to have special provisions in favour of extensive access to services that cater for and support future mothers in distress so as to help them bear their children .
We cannot accept , however , that European Union funds would be applied in abortion-oriented policies .
I would be even happier if I could be reassured tonight .
It is not a secret that an NGO , Marie Stopes International , actively worked with Parliament to prepare this legislation .
That is what we are asking for in Amendments 49 and 53 .
These efforts are all the more noteworthy because of the vague suspicions and frustrated attempts to include groundless justifications in the guidelines in question .
This is also why means are also necessary and these have been clearly insufficient .
However , as the record is read by many people , and as he mentioned quotations I made , I would like to point out that owing to the limited speaking time we have , I could not read out all that I wished to .
Our policy for combating drug addiction has proved to be a failure : the prohibitionist approach has given trafficking oxygen , allowing it to thrive and to make ever-greater profits , boosting both organised and petty crime , corrupting regimes and humiliating us for being powerless to do anything about it .
Our second priority is to develop a risk-reduction policy .
Mr President , I fail to understand how the voting list was put together , but what has happened is that the second part of Amendment No 49 was exactly the same as the second part of Amendment No 15 .
This is an attempt to maximise the potential
