should perhaps also be rather ashamed that our development aid policy has not been more successful in reducing the push factors in some of the countries of origin .
Until we succeed - and I recognise the work of the high-level working groups - in reducing these push factors , we ought perhaps to open our doors a little .
It might even be in our own interest , rejuvenating an ageing population and enriching our own culture .
I am pleased to hear that Canada is among the countries invited to the presidency 's seminar .
We might be advised to take a leaf out of Canada 's book .
The Liberal Government 's proposals there are to close the backdoor to illegal immigration but at the same time open the front door to a legal migration policy .

Mr President , I begin by endorsing the plaudits that have been offered to Mrs Haug.
She has indeed worked quite hard although , in the case of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , I am afraid she was working so hard that she was not able to pay anything more than a goodwill visit to our committee .
Therefore we have prepared the opinion which is before Parliament .
I will briefly touch on some of the points that arise from it .
Firstly , I want to support the points that are made by Mrs Haug concerning the implications of spending in the Balkans .
It is a matter that has been of significant concern to the Industry Committee .
We are particularly concerned about the implications for a wide range of the programmes that fall within our remit .
It certainly is the case that , with the move to activity-based budgeting , we are moving away from the concept that everything that was previously in the budget has to be preserved for the future .
Nonetheless a great deal of the programmes that are within our remit would be significantly affected by the spending proposals for the Balkans , unless Mrs Haug is successful .
So on behalf of the Industry Committee I should like to voice our support for her in that regard .
In two particular areas we are affected by multiannual programmes .
I want to reiterate our commitment in the research area .
I recognise that this is not a matter that is affected by the budget on this occasion , but we should not ignore the changes we are seeing in the energy sphere with Save and Altener .
The figures that we see are seeing for Save , where there is a significant reduction in the budget for energy efficiency schemes , are a result of the budgetary process last year .
That is only just now coming through .
The final point I want to make in the trade sphere relates to the need for us to ensure that the omnibus regulation for the transatlantic dialogue is adapted .
I hope the Commissioner will take that on board .
Mr President , all the points I have to make are addressed to the Council and even though there is no-one on the front bench I am sure the hardworking scribes will relay that information back to the Presidency and to all the Council delegations .
If you look at the Haug report , Parliament wants to find a solution .
We are actually looking for agreement with the Council on the way to get a good budget by the end of this year .
Let us get that point clear .
We are not looking for confrontation , we are actually looking for a way of cooperating together .
But do not be fooled into thinking that we are not prepared to take hard decisions if necessary .
It is pretty hard to get an agreement when the Council just ignores Article 20 of the Interinstitutional Agreement .
Ever since the PDB was published by the Commission they have been duty bound to discuss with us the revision of the Financial Perspective which was proposed by the Commission .
They have failed to do that .
On two occasions we have asked them for trialogues and we have been refused .
That makes it pretty difficult .
And that will be at the forefront of our discussions at the trialogue this week and in the conciliation on 20 July .
Whatever the Council votes on 20 July we will still be making that point in the autumn when it comes to our first reading .
From the very first trialogue of this year with the Portuguese Presidency , the one thing that was obvious to everyone is that we need an agreement between the three institutions on the funding for the western Balkans .
I am pretty sure Parliament has a position now .
The Council 's position is about 200 million less than ours , which means that we will not get an agreement on that and unless we have an agreement there is going to be a problem in how we fund the needs in category 4 .
It seems now that there might be some possibility of redeploying funds from the MEDA programme to help solve our problem .
For an institution that tells us that what was agreed in Berlin was set in concrete , I think the Council has a bit of a cheek in moving large sums of money from the MEDA programme which they agreed 12 months ago and then lecturing us about what can and cannot be moved .
Having said that , we are of course , prepared to listen to the Council , to hear what their suggestions are and I look forward to our trialogue this week and the conciliation meeting on 20 July .
Mr President , I am grateful for this opportunity to make some general comments about the 2001 Budget
