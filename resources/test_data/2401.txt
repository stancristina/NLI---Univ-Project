We in this European Union should follow that lead and ensure that every Directorate-General , every service of the European Union puts small businesses first .
Mr President , I also wish to thank Mrs Oomen-Ruijten for her work on this issue .
I share many of her criticisms and frustrations about the scope , implementation and speed of change to Regulation 1408/71 .
As a member of the Committee on Petitions , it is clear to me that there is a considerable and growing number of residents , including third-country nationals and frontier workers , for whom the current arrangements are not working satisfactorily .
Enlargement will make a complex system of coordination even more complex and it is not surprising that many citizens simply do not believe that the Union takes the free movement of citizens as seriously as it takes its commitment to the free movement of goods .
We have to find a way of simplifying things for citizens themselves and for the administrators of these systems .
It would not be surprising if we were to hear an increasing number of calls for a single European agency that would deal directly with national administrations on the citizens ' behalf .
The call for a directive concerning frontier effect reports is to be welcomed .
At least these would be proactive and could hopefully deal with some of the problems before they arise , which would make a pleasant change .
It is also clear that as more countries integrate their taxation and social security systems , we need to take action to tackle the resulting anomalies , which can result in double payments .
However , the key issue is that Member States need to prove their commitment to free movement by tackling problems openly and in a spirit which favours residents of the European Union .
Mr President , on a point of order .
I welcome the fact that there is now going to be a smoking rather than a non-smoking zone .
I hope now that all Members and all members of staff observe the no-smoking areas across the whole of the European Parliament building .
I am still having problems being able to get into the part-session and being able to get in and out of committee meetings , both here and in Brussels .
So I plead with everybody , now there is a smoking area , to use it and not the no-smoking areas , including the corridors and going up to the lift .
Mr President , on a point of order .
I was just wondering whether anybody is going to inform the particles of smoke where the smoking zone and the no-smoking zones are .
Mr President , there is indeed a crisis of succession in farming as Mr Parish with his expertise as a farmer knows well .
If this crisis is particularly acute in Mr Parish 's own Member State , it is the direct result of policies pursued by UK governments over the past twenty years , and to overcome it the United Kingdom must review the implications of the Fontainbleau Agreement for its contribution to European Union finances .
This has been disastrous for farming .
Moreover , the rapporteur , a member of the Conservative Party , must work within his own party to secure support for his proposals in the House of Commons .
In countries where less than 10 % of the population now lives in rural areas , it is too easy for governments to sideline the needs of these areas , and the message from this debate must be that they do so at the peril of their countries .
Mr President , Parliament 's Committee on the Environment is increasingly concerned that we are adopting European environmental legislation and then neglecting to implement it properly .
Putting it bluntly , we believe that the Council of Ministers , the Commission and the European Parliament are complicit in a deception of the public .
Opinion polls show that the majority of people support the idea that environmental issues are important and should be dealt with at European level .
We are adopting legislation that appears to fill this need .
In fact , in all too many cases , environmental laws are ignored , targets are not met , reports are not sent in to the Commission on time and those countries which break the law go unpunished .
The purpose of this debate is to highlight what is going wrong and to try and do something about it .
The Committee on the Environment has put together three reports , we call them 'insight reports ' , basing ourselves on the model of the US Congress .
We have found that the habitats directive is locked in controversy and law suits .
The PCBs directive is characterised by the failure of Member States to supply the all-important inventories of the stocks they hold .
The nitrates directive was probably flawed from the beginning and all but two countries , Denmark and Sweden of course , are now before the European Court of Justice because of their failure to implement it .
It is highly likely that these shortcomings are repeated throughout the canon of EU environmental law .
What can be done about this ?
We hope firstly that in the environmental action programme , which the world is eagerly awaiting , the Commission will key in adequate resources for following up what has happened to legislation .
It would be interesting to hear from the Commissioner roughly how many people in her Directorate are responsible for this as compared to those overseeing the introduction of new legislation .
There needs to be a much more honest debate secondly - nationally and at the European level - about the real possibility of achieving the environmental objectives set out in draft legislation .
Too often , we suspect ,
