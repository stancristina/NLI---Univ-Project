It will not be possible to satisfy fully all these claims and therefore we have to accept a compromise .
The Commission 's proposal is a compromise between those who demand an immediate move to a tariff only system and those who wish to ignore the WTO rulings and stick with the flawed regime as it is .
That is why the majority of the ELDR Group supports the Commission 's proposal to continue a tariff-rate quota system for a transitional period before moving to a definitive tariff only system .
The Dary report , on the other hand , is premised on the somewhat unrealistic notion that we can ignore rulings from the WTO altogether .
It gives complete priority to the concerns of EU banana producers over the equally legitimate concerns of innocent EU businesses in other sectors suffering from arbitrary US sanctions .
Most strange of all , it risks complicating matters so much further that the Commission , as stated in its proposal of November last year , will be obliged to move directly to a tariff only system .
This would be exactly the opposite of the objectives of those who support this report .
I have also heard that during the vote , which will take place either today or tomorrow , some may advocate referral back to committee .
This would be an undignified act of foot-dragging which would do nothing to address the long-term issues at stake .
We need stability for European and ACP banana producers and EU consumers .
That can be done by rejecting this report and supporting the Commission 's compromise proposal .
Mr President , I believe that these Commission proposals will mean that a number of African , Caribbean and Pacific countries will go out of business .
That will lead to poverty and even more deprivation .
Yes , we have to simplify the system .
It is far too complicated at the moment .
But I believe those countries need time to diversify properly and that is why I would agree with a ten-year transitional period .
Chiquita , Dole and Del Monte , who produce in Latin American countries , have not seen their production levels go down since 1993 .
Their access to the market has not gone down since 1993 .
All they want to do is get more access to the market at the expense of the ACP countries .
Yes , we have to find a solution .
Producers in the UK are being held to ransom by the USA .
We must not let ACP countries go to the wall just to save companies in the EU.
This is not just about bananas ; it is about trade with developing countries overall .
Mr President , I speak from three perspectives .
That of external trade , where I believe the European Union should uphold progress towards a liberalised world-trade order ; that of industry , European industry , where jobs and industries are at threat from sanctions and they are innocent victims of these sanctions ; and I speak from the perspective of a UK Member of this House who is tired of receiving letters of complaint from companies whose business and whose workers ' jobs are at threat from the sanctions through no fault of their own .
I regret various aspects of this Dary report .
I have to say that this timescale of ten years is wholly unrealistic and unreasonable .
I regret the attempt to cling on to quotas and to interfere with trade in that way .
Of course , I also regret proposals for higher rates of tariff , which is another intervention in trade .
The amendment , which has been put down in my name and others , calls for a negotiated settlement of this dispute , which is World Trade Organisation compatible .
That is essential .
We have been down this road several times now and innocent companies and jobs are at risk and being threatened as a result of our failure to come to grips with this situation .
I support the Commissioner 's efforts .
He has a difficult task .
I have to say that I cannot think of anything more reasonable or pragmatic or sensible than the amendment which a number of colleagues have supported me in submitting .
Madam President , although some people are pleased at the decision that has been taken , this creates a very dangerous precedent .
Whenever , in future , there is an explanatory statement which some in the House do not like we have established that every time we will be able to vote against if we wish to do so .
Madam President , this is a compromise amendment which was negotiated among groups and then , of course , examined by the various groups last night .
Our Group supports this compromise amendment with , however , the exception of one word : "plus " - "plus proportionnelle " .
Presumably the English version is "more proportional" .
We cannot accept that word .
However , under the Rules , it is not possible to ask for a split vote on a compromise amendment .
I note that if Amendments Nos 100 and 101 were both to be adopted , it would come to exactly the same text as this compromise amendment , except for the problematic word "more " . As I know that colleagues in other groups had exactly the same problem with this word , I would suggest to friends and colleagues that it might be appropriate not to accept the compromise amendment but to vote instead in favour of both Amendments Nos 100 and 101 , which are compatible , and that would achieve precisely the result desired by many people .
Madam President , I think it is fair that it be put to the vote .
However , my
