over is not all that there remains for us to do , however .
Our Member States must use the old , tried-and-trusted European formula and talk to each other , even on matters relating to foreign affairs and security policy .
I believe , however , that this should also filter through to other files that were mentioned in the summit conclusions .
I would therefore like clarification on this point .
Let us suppose that it simply did not know that ignoring this article violates the agreement on loyal cooperation between the Council and Parliament and therefore blows it out of the water .
And that is how it will be in the Treaties .
Nevertheless it seems as if the Council is in fact doing this by undermining the budget right , which is one of Parliament 's essential prerogatives .
It is in legislative terms the second and final major tranche of the Commission reform programme , so when the Council adopts this proposal all the essential building blocks will be in place for making sure the Commission becomes more efficient and more effective than it has ever been .
It is very sad that , so far , this House has been unable to ensure that all parliamentary assistants are properly paid and have adequate social security cover .
I am talking about the condition under which the unmarried partner of a European official may claim equal treatment .
This is a solution which , incidentally , has been practised for many years by the European Central Bank .
I believe that the Commission 's proposals are good but not ambitious enough , and the Commission is also not ambitious enough in its timetable .
If farmers are having to produce our food in a sort of spacesuit , should we not be asking ourselves whether we should not be organising our food production differently ?
Another difficult problem that is particularly controversial is the use of GMOs .
In Europe we have still not properly added up what the use of pesticides actually costs society .
Large-scale agriculture depends on these substances for the production of crops .
It is over-simplistic to attempt to reduce the use of pesticides by 50 % within a period of 10 years .
That cannot be right ; it does not work that way .
I particularly welcome the Commission 's initiative to set up a platform for clinical trials .
Firstly , we have to see to it that industry is involved in this project .
Thirdly , AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis are a good place to start .
Making this fruit visible will enable this project to act as a stimulus for joining forces in other fields , too .
Europe is not doing the world justice if it does not work together , and it is not doing itself justice if it does not derive any inspiration from the cooperation in the field of clinical trials .
I think that that last point , in particular , is extremely important .
The Commission 's proposal to set up the Erasmus Mundus programme will shortly be given the support of our Parliament .
In addition , existing efforts must not be replaced , but rather stepped up .
The rapporteur has already cited the figures .
I hope that it will constitute a good start to more intensive cooperation in many fields within the EU.
This report is based on political motives , as the previous speaker illustrated .
- ( NL ) The Council has the power to make a different proposal from the one the Commission and Parliament had in mind after Parliament has agreed to it at second reading .
Voting in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market took place so late that only one day remained for the tabling of amendments before the plenary session .
We do not know whether his successor will be any better for the Iraqi people , but he will certainly be better for the supply of oil to the United States .
I wrote a letter to you , Mr President , asking for the delegation to be postponed , not for it to be cancelled .
What we were able to avert in time then is happening today .
Antibiotics do not work and there are , as yet , no antiviral drugs , so we must be extremely cautious .
Thirdly , the Greek Presidency must call a meeting of the European Ministers of Health very soon for additional consultations on how to tackle SARS .
It would be nice if we could reduce this percentage in future .
I am withdrawing these amendments out of my concern that certain Member States will use this to follow a mediation procedure after all .
We also want to try to improve the environment on our roads by means of training , because if drivers know how that works , they will be able to influence it .
I would like to ask the Commissioner how we can get the CEMT to pay attention to the specialist training and follow-up training we are aiming towards for members from Member States and drivers working for companies registered in those Member States , otherwise we will be left with an unresolved problem .
So far only two Member States have this kind of training .
Combining numerous traffic situations in a simulator is therefore a step in the right direction .
It will enable Member States to set up and maintain practice-oriented training .
Better drivers should be driving on our roads .
Mr President , although I wonder whether it is really so important whether the programme proposed by the Commission should be called Erasmus World or Erasmus Mundus , I would like to thank Mrs De Sarnez for her thorough report .
The Commission 's proposal has come at exactly the right time .
