endorse what you said about the continuing completion of the internal market , and also about the further realisation of the research area that you mentioned – as did the President of the Commission as well .
If we want that , we need social stability .
If we were to succeed in bringing together in reconciliation a society of Muslims – which is what Turkish society is – with a society to whose values you have referred , such as freedom , solidarity , fraternity , civilian control of the armed forces , respect for human rights , the abolition of the death penalty , the freedom of the justice system ; if we were to succeed in demonstrating that Islam and the Western value-system were not mutually exclusive , but mutually compatible , it would prove the Bin Ladens of this world wrong .
It has been apparent even from the very first minutes of this debate that the issue of the European Union’s relations with Turkey will have a major part to play .
I am therefore firmly convinced that we have to seize the opportunity presented by the debate on the Constitution to bring Europe and its citizens closer together .
On the contrary , it all goes together and that is why it is important that people who aspire to positions of responsibility also declare their allegiance to the country they come from .
That is what we expect of you and of all members of the Commission .
Are you the man who can shape the Commission ’s relationship with the other European institutions in the way that we as socialists expect ?
Are you , for example , the candidate to deal with the USA as an equal when enforcing these demands ?
That relationship has been upset by this very selection process in the last few months .
That would be a pity .
At the same time , I would like to point out , however , that the issue is also that this confidence must not be abused .
Only if Parliament acts with an absolute majority does it play its part in the triangle of power formed by it , the Commission and the Council .
This Euro-apathy will become rejection of Europe if we go over the public’s heads in this way .
In the hearings , in my speech yesterday , and this morning too , we have put four crucial questions , to which we expect answers .
The European People’s Party members have cast their votes for Mr Borrell , and now the Social Democrats are voting against your candidate for the Commission .
The USA , too , must come to understand that the EU takes something of a different approach to the environment and air transport .     – Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am very grateful to the Commissioner for pointing out that every instrument is needed in order to guarantee climate protection , and for describing the ICAO goals as contrary to all the goals that we in the EU have set .
Even though we are seeing a changeover to a new Commission and will not be able to sort this out this evening , let me ask , Commissioner , that the Commission should respond to this calamity by producing a proper report with good analysis of both the environmental and transport aspects ; then it might put forward some proposals for legislation , perhaps as part of the package .
I call upon the General Secretariat of the Council to ensure in future that the Presidency of the Council is represented in this House , for that is the General Secretariat’s function – to ensure that the most important institutions are present .
Terrorism can never be justified , and we must fight it with all the strength and determination at our disposal .
That involves ensuring that they are understood , which I see as an important aspect of stabilising European democracy .
That , too , is something we must not lose sight of .
In order to keep his hands on his personal power , he chose the day of the parliamentary elections , the day when democracy could have returned to the country , to demand a vote of confidence in him , as a distraction from the real issues , the real questions that the people are asking , as to why things are getting worse and worse while the situation in the neighbouring countries is improving , why it is that they cannot share in the neighbouring states ’ prosperity , why the consequences of Chernobyl are denied , why aid projects are banned , why health care is being cut back and why experts collecting data to enable help to be given are put behind bars .
You drew our attention to security policy , and I see it as , in principle , the right approach , that the Commission is already – as I hope the incoming Commission will do even more intensively and to a wider extent – joining with our neighbours in attempting to shape immigration and security policy and to avoid in future the unwelcome developments that we have seen over recent weeks , months , and indeed years , in particular in the Mediterranean , where many have tried to reach Europe , only to die in the attempt .
We must bring the best brains back to Europe or find a way of keeping them here ; that is the investment I see as being particularly important in our own countries , but also , of course , in the countries adjoining us , so that we might invest more in education and training in those of the countries adjoining us that are drawing closer to Europe .
