is one of the biggest challenges that we face in the 21st century .
I support a clear strategy in the fight against terrorism aimed at striking a balance between collective security and individual freedom .
Lastly , I turn to the extremely important question of solidarity with the victims of terrorism .
Yet whilst we know about the danger and wish to take action , we are also aware that much remains to be done .
It must not be forgotten , however , that the EU has made undertakings and it is now time to turn plans into action , and in the context of our international obligations , especially those taken on by the United States in the field of combating bioterrorism , which are being developed on the other side of the Atlantic in the form of Project BioShield .
We are opposed to that objective .
Nonetheless , when new infrastructure is built , maintained or enhanced , the environmental impact must be taken into account and procedures must be followed for the prior notification and consultation of the people affected , as laid down in Community and national legislation .
We object , however , to the emphasis on liberalising the market in the area of energy efficiency , in particular domestic consumption , from July 2007 , as contained in a number of the rapporteur’s proposals .
In this particular case , the data that can be obtained in this way is both cross-border in nature and can be used for cross-border purposes .
The ongoing debate is not promising , and everything points to cuts taking place , thus leading to a policy that will fail to promote economic and social cohesion , jobs and social inclusion .
I have therefore voted in favour of this report regardless of the outcome of the debate on the Financial Perspective .
In the approach to this issue , underlying political issues keep coming to the surface , resulting in issues that are – or can be – politically different being lumped together .
Hence the unacceptable agreements between the EU and the United States concerning the exchange of personal data , the unacceptable criminalisation of organisations fighting for the fundamental rights of a people , such as the right to sovereignty and independence and the unacceptable attacks on sovereign countries .
It is therefore essential that we strike a constant balance between what we must sacrifice and the elements that are indispensable to preserving our way of life .
The task now is to translate our political will into financial commitment and I am delighted to see Parliament’s determination and resolve in assessing the resources the Union needs to accomplish its project .
As the Presidency representative , whom I greet , has just pointed out , the agreement on the Financial Perspectives is not an agreement between the Member States in the European Council .
I recognise that the resolution Parliament is examining today is full and balanced .
It will be crucial for us , the institutions , to maintain our alliance on the project until negotiations are concluded .
An agreement would , however , demonstrate to our fellow citizens that despite the serious difficulties we are experiencing today , Europe is capable of acting , that it has a project for the future and that it is capable of putting it into effect .
Mr President , while Parliament is agreeing its position the negotiations in Council continue .
In this respect , I would like to stress the very good cooperation between the Commission and the presidency in the handling of this matter since January .
The proposal made includes the freezing and phased reduction of the UK rebate , and some compensation for Germany , the Netherlands and Sweden , to take account of their excessive budgetary burdens .
We must accept that the presidency has found a balanced solution .
This effort will be diluted if not backed up by investment .
Hard choices would have to be made if this proposal were accepted .
I take comfort in the position of Parliament as laid down in the draft resolution today .
We want a consensus for the next European Council .
It should also be pointed out that the request to enhance the financial framework of the ‘Progress ’ programme so as to pave the way for the effective implementation of the Lisbon Strategy and the Social Agenda represents a success for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
It should also be noted that equality between men and women must be included in all Community policies across the board and special attention should be given to …     . – Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , I should first like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work , but I also wish to say , if I may , that I am very concerned that we have had access to a negotiating fund – offered to us , indeed , by the Luxembourg Presidency – which reduced Parliament’s proposal by around EUR 100 000 million .
This is something that worries us greatly and I should like to implore the Council to take our genuine needs on board .
These proposals include complete compensation for regions , such as the Algarve , affected by the so-called statistical effect , a specific programme targeted at Portugal and Greece to adjust their economies in light of the impact of the enlargement , an end to the pegging of the cohesion fund to the Stability and Growth Pact , the rejection of renationalising the costs of cofinancing the common agricultural policy , the promotion of a fairer model for distributing agricultural aid , the guarantee of a seven-year financial framework and the creation of a Community programme for the textiles and clothing sector , especially for the least-favoured regions that depend on that sector
