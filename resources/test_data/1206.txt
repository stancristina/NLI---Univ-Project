Lastly , we should note the progress that has been made and the commitments that have been given with regard to impact studies and to simplifying the , and transposing Community law-making and monitoring its implementation .
It should cover not only the civilian domain but also aspects of security and defence .
Because the Treaty provides for space competence to be shared at European level , the Commission will have to ensure that full use is made of this competence .
Lastly , one crucial aspect of an ambitious European space policy concerns funding .
I believe that we are indeed at a pivotal moment in Europe for determining whether we are going to have our own independent and proactive space policy , taking us further both in terms of technology and of scientific development .
The Commission also received encouragement for its approach through several resolutions adopted by your Parliament , specifically following the fire in the Gothard tunnel in October 2001 .
With regard to Mr Rack’s report , I should like , Mr President and Mr Rack , not to go through the 78 amendments one by one , but to divide them into groups .
As I said , the engineers face a long haul in order to bring the tunnels into line with the provisions of the directive and this work must be begun as soon as possible .     Mr President , Commissioner , the Cunha report rightly emphasises the enormous economic importance , for both the Member States of the Union and the partner States , of the twenty-one international fisheries agreements concluded by the Community .
Is there any political alternative we can propose to this gradual approach ?
This is indeed an abomination in economic and human terms , but it is also a real provocation in political terms .
New wars will be waged in defence of the principle of retaliation .
The little success it has had in submitting its case to the Security Council has shown its isolation at international level , which adds to its relative regional isolation since the war in Iraq and its military weakness since Damascus has stopped receiving supplies of sophisticated weapons sold on credit .
Mr Monti quite rightly said that Hamas and Islamic Jihad do not recognise Israel’s right to exist , as the suicide attacks have shown .
The CPNT MEPs of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities are unable to approve these documents .     I voted in favour of the Frassoni report on ‘Better Law-Making’ .
Space will always be an engine of industrial innovation .
Indeed , the real problems posed by the acceleration of the global movement towards concentrations between undertakings are treated exclusively as threats to competition .
The reasons are exaggerated because the resolution overestimates the risks ( this data is not all that personal since the interested parties have already passed it on to the airlines ) and tends to restrict the categories of criminal sought ( why accept this data in connection with tracking down terrorists , but not murderers or rapists ? )
Bee populations have been falling for years in proportions that put pollination at risk .
For our part , we propose that there be a debate on Chechnya , on the basis of a resolution , at the mini part-session , that is to say in a fortnight 's time .
We need to compare different people 's experiences and indeed take advantage of the good example set by the Scandinavian countries on forest management , but we also need to see our forests as part of our rural development strategy .
Finally , where the projects are concerned , we would ask that one of the factors in the selection process be biodiversity , because although it is true that it is difficult to explain what biodiversity is , we are very well aware of how important it is in the forestry environment .
Is the intention , in the long term , to ban surfing , windsurfing , kayaking and rowing because the water is deemed to be unsuitable for bathing ?
The text in question makes it possible to put in place an efficient and reliable emissions calculation and projection system , an essential precondition for producing an evaluation of the situation in Europe that can be passed up to international level .

The Education Council proposed allocating this programme EUR 180 million .
Erasmus Mundus has the potential to become both a benchmark of European academic excellence and a vector for dialogue between peoples .
We will exert all the pressure we can in support of this policy and we are pleased to have found an opportunity to do so here .
In fact , we are aware that this training is one of the keys to the programme 's success and that all of the Member States are already working on it .
It is therefore a step in the right direction .
Commissioner , we all know that enacting rules on the subject is not enough and we must not simply see this as an empty gesture , because we constantly need to follow up specific cases that are submitted to us .
