There are few people in the rabble we have seen invading farms who could afford the employees , the machinery , seeds and fertilisers to farm these units to give a potential export output .
I have seen some of the farms that were reclaimed some years ago by Mr Mugabe and most of the fertile productive land has reverted to bush and the buildings and farmhouses are now crumbling ruins .
What a waste in a country dependent on agricultural exports !
Over the last few years , there has been a move to persuade political leaders in African regions to carry more responsibility for conflict prevention .
It was , therefore , gratifying to hear Nelson Mandela criticising the policies of the Zimbabwe president who is destroying his country .
I am sorry that President Mbeki , his successor , who is probably the most powerful leader in Africa , has not in public condemned the violence in Zimbabwe .
We in Parliament are right to call on the Commission to review its development cooperation with Zimbabwe if transparent elections are not held or if the opposition wins and the violence continues .
The use of Article 366 should be considered .
The World Bank has now cut funding because of debt arrears and Zimbabwe , as a country , is in liquidation .
We can but live and hope that a peaceful conclusion can be reached in Zimbabwe as it is the people themselves who are suffering most in this unstable situation the country finds itself in .
I have to say at the outset that I am extremely encouraged by the fact that the Commission has worked out such a very clear strategy for dealing with these very critical weeks before the election takes place .
I particularly welcome the fact that we are training domestic observers - I think that is very important and will offset the likelihood of Mugabe criticising us for coming in in a neo-colonialist way to interfere in his election .
I also welcome the fact that we will be supporting civil society ' s objectives in these next few weeks .
I very much hope , Commissioner , that we will disseminate this kind of information in Zimbabwe because those people trying to mount an opposition campaign will be heartened by the kind of information that we have had from you today and I think that would be important .
One of the things I want to talk about briefly is the role of the state-controlled media in the run-up before the election .
The Commissioner did not mention this , but it would be sensible to do so because TV , radio and state-owned newspapers in Zimbabwe are acting now as if they were the agents of Zanu-PF.
All reporting of opposition parties is negative , with the MDC a particular target .
I would really like to know what we can do from the European Union to try to ensure that the opposition groups - and there are 26 parties standing in the election - have some access to the media .
State-controlled media , Commissioner , is refusing to take paid advertising even from the main NGOs who are just working to support the electoral process and democracy in Zimbabwe , or from any opposition parties .
Only three independent newspapers are carrying any kind of adverts from parties other than Zanu-PF so that only the claims of the government are being read or seen by the people and that has to be a contradiction if we are talking about providing democracy .
The fact is that the independent press does not have the print capacity to deal with demand .
People in Zimbabwe are afraid .
The deaths and injuries in the rural areas and increasingly in the towns are deeply worrying .
Zanu-PF has the government resources , and the MDC supporters are too afraid to donate money .
I even read in the British press that Kabila and Qadhafi are giving money now to Mugabe ' s campaign , which is a bit frightening .
It is deeply worrying that the opposition are fighting their campaign on Zanu-PF grounds .
They have no control over the electoral roll , they have no control over the polling stations that will be run by government civil servants .
This is wrong because the role of these government civil servants in the last referendum was very dubious indeed .
The people understand that and are aware of it .
There is evidence also of this Fifth Brigade being involved in pre-election crackdowns .
The Fifth Brigade were responsible for the brutality that Mugabe perpetuated in Matabeleland in the 80s .
That also is something that worries me and I would like the EU to look into it .
Finally , President , let us be sure that we work as a European Union to create the conditions which will allow the people of Zimbabwe to express their choices in this election in June and express their choices in secret and without fear .
Mr President , I too would like to start by welcoming the Commission ' s strategy for the run-up to the election that has just been set out by the Commissioner and , in particular , the training of the Zimbabwean election monitors .
The black people of Zimbabwe are still suffering under the legacy of colonialism .
Cecil Rhodes , one of Britain 's most successful colonists , said the purpose of colonialism was : " To find new lands in which we can easily obtain raw materials and at the same time exploit the cheap labour that is available from the natives of the colonies " .
The legacy of this barbarically successful strategy can be seen in the chaos that is happening in Zimbabwe today .
Today , just 4 000 white farmers still own over
