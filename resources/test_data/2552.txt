expressed to take into account the consequences of modern means of technology and , obviously , of the Internet in this review , this update .
First , each Member State must respect European law , and the European Commission , the guardian of the treaties , must make sure of this in the most impartial way possible .
That is , the Community method ; and on this , Mr Van Rompuy , we are counting on you .
I will mention a few examples .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like very briefly to say a few words in response .
This dialogue is extremely important for stability and peace in this area , which is also a European area , and which must have a European perspective .
Finally , we have agreed on a commercial agreement with South Korea .
With respect to the problem of the Roma , I would repeat the five points , which are not the Council 's conclusions as such , but on which there is a very broad consensus .
That will prove a major contribution , not only to support of the European idea , but also a major contribution to economic growth .
I asked , demanded in fact - as we have done since then - that there should be a common position of the 27 .
Of course , we will not say in the European Council conclusions what strategy we will develop and what balances we will present to our strategic partners , such as our Chinese partners .
Apart from saving the banks and others , we ran a very risky expansionist policy in 2008 and , in large part , in 2009 .
We have integrated an education policy and we are maintaining a cohesion policy .
They will help establish a true European supervisory area , which is indispensable for strengthening the internal market .
This is partly the case with the Omnibus I Directive , on which Parliament is being asked to give its opinion today .
Allow me , in turn , to thank your rapporteurs , Mr García-Margallo , Mr Skinner , Mr Sánchez Presedo , Mrs Goulard , Mr Giegold , Mr Tremosa i Balcells and Mr Balz , as well as the shadow rapporteurs .
We will have a supervision model that is adapted to prevent crises more effectively .
On behalf of all the services of the Commission , I would like to thank you for that .
The second element that I would like to underline is that it is a question of the beginning of a process .
I have taken all of the sensitive issues surrounding intellectual property into consideration .
Today , we are being asked to vote for setting up a financial structure which endorses and therefore guarantees the implementation of this disastrous mechanism .
I am pleased that the European Parliament has adopted the legislation on pharmacovigilance , which strengthens provisions on this subject in European legislation concerning medicines for human use .
For the first time , materials treated with biocides will also be regulated .
One cannot expect to do more , more quickly and at less cost without compromising the quality of the work .
The lack of coordination between national supervisory bodies increased the future risk of financial institutions failing .
They should be attached to the Council of Member States .
With real coercive power , the latter will have the last word in the event of disagreement with national bank regulators .
Without fiscal harmonisation , without a common industrial policy , without strong initiatives for growth and jobs , we will not be in a position to resist market pressure or to ensure that the wealth produced in Europe is fairly distributed between all citizens .
For me , the challenge in this matter is the following : on the one hand , we need to protect intellectual property rights , for they guarantee dynamic and flourishing creativity and innovation , yet , on the other , we need to develop legal services allowing as many people as possible to access online creative content easily .
That is why the issue of intellectual property rights is legitimate .
While it is true that the alternative resolutions tabled by members of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament were not entirely satisfactory either , they had the virtue of ruling out wrong and ill-suited solutions .
However we must show responsibility .
Indeed , the Democratic Republic of Congo has been on the precipice and is still , moreover , in the grip of conflicts , which , although contained , are very tragic for the people .
We fully support this appeal in line with the joint declaration of 27 August by the High Representative , Catherine Ashton , and the European Commissioner for Development , Andris Piebalgs .
Mr President , it is impossible to speak here on behalf of the women rape victims who have lost their dignity , of the mutilated babies , of the pregnant women whose stomachs have been cut open , of the elderly women who have been violated with bayonets thrust into their vaginas , and of all those women whose bodies have become , to their shame , but , above all , to ours , a devastated battlefield .
I am sorry to say that , in view of the little progress that has been made in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) , we must condemn the serious setbacks and failures .
Mr President , I can only concur with what has been said , especially with the remarks made by Mrs De Keyser , who gave a very harsh and very raw description of the violence being perpetrated against women
