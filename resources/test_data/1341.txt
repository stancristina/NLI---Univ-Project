legal basis .
Rather , it was a matter of needing to put the legal basis in order .
In the case of two of the reports , this happens with the help of Article 308 , and this , in a way , shows the importance of Article 308 .
We are obliged to have such an article in case matters were suddenly to arise that , for example , needed to be put right .
On the other hand , the same article must not of course be abused , as there has perhaps been a tendency for it to have been .
In reality , it is a question of something that is extremely political : firstly , a power struggle between the EU institutions and , secondly , our relations with people in the European democracy within and outside Europe .
I wish , in any case , to make a general remark , however , namely that it is striking that the women’s programme is the shortest one .
I therefore take the view that , as the work continues , some thought might be given to why on earth women , as usual , have to be in the most vulnerable position .
Regarding the second matter , I should like to say that I come from a country that has been a member of the EU since 1972 .
It will be something beyond people 's ken , and we may be in danger of their ending up feeling poorly disposed towards the project .
I am slightly annoyed that women , specifically , have been given the shortest programme .
I would say again that experience from my own country shows that it is women who are most sceptical towards the project .
There may be a variety of explanations for this , but that is not something I can go into now , because I do not have the time .
I shall just comment on the individual reports .
In that context , I simply ask myself whether this programme would enable the candidate countries in actual fact to join on the basis of those criteria .
There is not therefore perhaps so much basic material to work on in the candidate countries when it comes to relations with third countries .
I just want to emphasise , however , that this must be developed all the time so that we ensure that not only the NGOs but also people in general are given the opportunity to participate in this work .
In that context , it is incredibly important that there not only be traditional organisations involved , but also organisations that take very broad cultural initiatives .
Finally , the issue of the programme for women .
I engaged in some constructive cooperation with the rapporteur prior to the publication of this report , but there is considerable disagreement in the committee .
There are therefore also a number of us who are in actual fact voting in favour of extending the programme and in favour of various other amendments that I had heard the Commission had rejected but for which we nonetheless hope a majority can be created .     Mr President , with these proposals , we wish to see two international agreements implemented on Persistent Organic Pollutants , otherwise known as POPs .
They have even been found in Commissioner Wallström’s blood .
The international agreements we are now entering into are there to ensure that some of the world’s most poisonous substances are phased out through measures to eliminate them and through controls on their use , import and export , as well as on emissions from them .
Since the Stockholm Convention itself refers to the environment and public health , the point of departure must be the environment , and we have therefore chosen to bet on its being Article 175 , namely the environment article , that will be used .
This means that we must proceed on the basis of the precautionary principle .
We must ensure that we stick to the existing stocks on the basis of the ‘polluter pays ’ principle .
It means that we in Europe must reduce the quantity of waste , partly through sorting and partly through recycling .
Finally , we must also ensure that the developing countries are in a position to comply with these agreements , which also cover , for example , DDT.
It means that we must be willing to guarantee research into , and the development of , new substances that can be used and that do not have harmful effects .
She also pleaded with them not to let a single drop of the people’s blood stain the earth .
Violent military operations are under way , and people are being displaced , killed and raped .
Concern about the population of Aceh should be growing for several reasons .
After a six-months ’ offensive , 40 % of the people are living under the poverty line .
The situation in Aceh is naturally complicated , involving as it does diametrically opposed political visions , competition for gas and oil resources and a population that , for a long time , has been denied the autonomy promised during the war of independence .
On the contrary , the military ’s violent infringements of human rights will lead to still greater support for the insurgents .
I fear that both parties ’ armed forces believe that they can escape unpunished from their misdeeds when independent observers are unable to gain access to Aceh .
Especially worrying are the latest rumours that a military group suspected of having committed systematic human rights abuses in East Timor in 1999 , together with a group of soldiers from the Indonesian army charged with , or convicted or suspected of , serious human rights abuses are now also active in Aceh
