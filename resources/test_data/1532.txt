Mr President , I really do think that my answer was fairly clear .
If Libya can give clear and satisfactory answers in connection with the outstanding issues , it will be able , upon request , to participate in the Barcelona Process , even if it has ambitions for a rapprochement with the African continent .
There would appear , however , to be two conflicting trends in Libya .
At the EU-Ukraine summit in Copenhagen this summer , Ukraine was informed about the Council 's decision in April to highlight the opportunity of strengthening relations between the future enlarged EU and its new neighbours .
The EU and Ukraine were agreed that the enlargement process creates new opportunities and challenges in various areas .
It was also agreed to step up the relevant partnership and cooperation bodies ' discussions of the effects of enlargement on , for example , trade-related issues , visas , the movement of persons and the promotion of regional and cross-border cooperation .
It is important for Ukraine to become better at fulfilling its obligations if these aspirations are to have real content .
The EU will continue to support Ukraine in the reform process , including the strengthening of the judicial system , media freedom , human rights and civil society .
The Danish Presidency feels duty-bound to step up EU-Ukraine cooperation .
The Presidency believes that it should be the EU 's overall objective to make the dialogue and cooperation with Ukraine more focused and results-oriented .
The development of an overall EU policy towards the EU 's new neighbours , with full respect for the differences between the countries involved , will help in achieving the overall objectives .
The Council reiterated its conviction that EU enlargement will offer a good opportunity to strengthen relations between the EU and its new neighbours with a view to creating stability and narrowing the gap in prosperity at the EU 's new borders .
I should like to thank Mr Sacr√©deus for the great interest he has shown in Ukraine .
I should like to compliment Parliament on the report on Ukraine which - if I remember correctly - was adopted approximately a year ago .
Mr President , with the historical background of which we are all of course aware , there is no doubt at all that the subject of nuclear safety will be part of any discussion between the European Union and Ukraine .
At its meeting on 21 October , the Council expressed satisfaction with the agreement concerning the new government in Skopje .
The EU will maintain its strong commitment to Macedonia and will actively support a government amenable to reforms .
The Stabilisation and Association Agreement has not come into force because it has still not been ratified .
As part of a multi-annual programme for the years 2002-2004 , the European Community has appropriated EUR 130.5 million to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in order to support the country as it prepares to fulfil the obligations associated with the interim agreement and the Stabilisation and Association Agreement .
The Member States and the Commission are following carefully the progress in fulfilling these criteria that is being made by the authorities in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia .
Precisely because of the deep psychological significance of this issue , so rightly pointed out by Mr Posselt , I do not intend to express any opinion at all on it .
I cannot say offhand that there are funds for the middle class .
As far as I know , the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has no other kind of enterprises , so I do not think the honourable Member needs to worry .
The Council emphasises that it attaches exceptional importance to full compliance with human rights and also to the efforts to find a political solution and to improve the humanitarian situation .
I should also like to thank Mr Dupuis for the commitment he has shown for many years - especially when it comes to the humanitarian situation in Chechnya - for as long , in fact , as he has been , as I was , a member of this Parliament .
The agenda for the EU-Russia Summit that is to take place in Copenhagen on 12 November has still not been prepared .
As I said earlier , however , the Council is well aware that many abductions have taken place and it has , in common with Parliament , regretted the fact time and time again .
Unfortunately , the situation is such that what Mr Dupuis says is probably right , but the Council has not yet received any information about the incident .
Naturally , I cannot , here on behalf of the Council , say what the answer will be , but I want to say thank you for the proposal and am also able to add that the Council is , of course , deeply engaged with the issues mentioned here .
As a matter of principle , the Council never comments on press reports .
With regard to the visit in question , I should like to make it clear that , during her visit , the Belgian Deputy Prime Minister , Mrs Onkelinx , expressed her condemnation of stoning .
Human rights issues - and , specifically , the use of cruel forms of execution such as stoning - have always been high on the agenda of the comprehensive political dialogue that takes place at the half-yearly meetings between Iran and the EU.
Furthermore , the EU makes regular overtures in connection with such matters .
All three sentences have been appealed against , so the judgments are still not final .
There must be no doubt at all that the Council will follow these cases very carefully .
More generally , I can inform you that the EU has discussed an initiative aimed at establishing
