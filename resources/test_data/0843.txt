voting situation arose .
You can read these conclusions , which are attached to my report , and as rapporteur I am quite prepared to accept the conclusions numbered 1d , 2a , 2b and 6b .
There we all do ourselves a disservice and perhaps that has also been of great help in clarifying certain aspects .
The search for security and peace in Europe is taking on a new and special form in the Baltic Sea region .
Given the difficult structural adjustment processes in the Baltic countries , we must increase the volume of Union aid for this region .
But this also indicates the need for reform within the Commission when it comes to structural policy in an interregional framework .
This is a very serious matter , and we must take note of it .
So what this amounts to saying is that the Commission 's idea is that they themselves should foot the bill for the damage .
However , I regard it as virtually impossible , in democratic terms , to monitor three classes , and it creates confusion among farmers too .
I call on Parliament as a matter of urgency to agree with my proposal .
Commissioner Fischler , you said that the measures adopted by the British government would be that government 's responsibility .
Mr McCartin , as the draftsman of that opinion , has already referred to it .
If Parliament 's amendments are not , in essence , being accepted , we shall call for referral back to committee , so that we can negotiate with the Commission ; because this is the more important point as far as we are concerned .
The Commissioner told us earlier what he can accept and what he cannot accept .
This is important to ensure that , rather than the whole of mass production being involved in this premium , it should reflect a preference for production on smaller farms where animals are kept under the right conditions for their species .
I must do that , though , otherwise the House will not know what it is about .
But in the very next paragraph of your answer you refer to a world-wide spreading of the BIV virus .
The incorporation of the international human rights clauses into the Maastricht II Treaty would be another step towards making the economic activities of the EU obligatorily conditional on respect for human rights .
Mr Hughes 's question , too , only involves a vote , if we adopt the same procedure there as we have with many other reports today .
Also , Mr Cot 's behaviour is not undemocratic but legitimate .
Nor should we fall into the trap of seeking a European answer to the abstraction that is Disney culture .
We regard this as a dubious practice , and one that demonstrates the real need for a change in cultural policy .
What we should therefore be doing today is celebrating the fact that we have reached this second reading stage on the Ariane cultural support programme , the objectives of which are indeed worthy ones : the promotion and wider dissemination of contemporary works of literature and drama , and encouraging cooperation by networks and partnerships .
These concerned , in particular , the position of nationals of Member States who hold diplomas awarded by third countries .
In terms of value for money , the cheapest option is undoubtedly rapid healing , through effective diagnosis and treatment .
Thank you , Mr President .
There are cuts of ECU 1 billion on agricultural spending , but in view of the substantial excesses of last year , that is hardly a convincing figure , indeed I regard it as a dishonest figure .
It is time that we stopped harping on about the trans-European networks .
It may be that all we need is a little more courage !
The plan now is to take the money away from some poor regions to give it to other poor regions .
But we refuse to renounce the Interinstitutional Agreement , because we have committed ourselves to an austerity budget , and in that respect our position differs from that of the Group of the Party of European Socialists .
The Group of the Party of European Socialists wishes to reinstate ECU 1 billion in the Structural Funds , in order to avoid creating the impression that the European Parliament is turning its back on structural policy .
Ultimately , it will make no difference at all if we include a billion more or less : the real scandal is that ECU 23 billion has so far gone unspent - at a time when there are 18 million people out of work in the Union .
I understand that this approach has found favour with you , Mrs Bjerregaard .
Water is life .
The way in which the summit was handled , too , followed a well-beaten path : if a summit seems likely to fail , or if nothing - absolutely nothing at all - emerges from it , there are two ways of glossing over this failure .
We should certainly not tamper with the chapter on monetary union and make amendments to it .
It is not true that the elimination of the internal borders made cross-border organized crime in Europe possible in the first place .
The reintegration of marginalized people into society by finding them meaningful employment through a social programme is certainly desirable .
Madam President , only chance dictates that we have now moved on from the debate on the reform conference to the subject of poverty , but it is highly appropriate !
That was also the reason why the Committee on External Economic Relations , in its report , had to examine the political and historical background to this association agreement
