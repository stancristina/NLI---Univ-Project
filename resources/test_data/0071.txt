initiative of the Kurds , which is based on openness to dialogue .
If you know what is right , you also know what is wrong , but if you do not know what is wrong , you will never achieve what is right .
I address my final appeal to the Kurds , to those who have fought for democracy in all the geographical regions they live in ; they must first of all live in peace amongst each other .
Together , with Parliament , we have already come a long way in terms of effectiveness and I believe that the Athens games were a fine example of this , since , during those games , more cases of doping were detected than during all the previous games put together .
To conclude , if these areas are safeguarded , it is encouraging that the Commission has decided to modernise the GSP.     Mr President , in accordance with Article 122 of the old Rules of Procedure , and Article 145 of the new Rules of Procedure , I have the honour of making a personal statement .
A period such as 2003 can be analysed from two perspectives : what exactly happened in 2003 and what was decided in 2003 .
Thirdly , in our proposals for the future , we are naturally thinking about the new countries ’ accession .
Results are mediocre , growth is weak , domestic demand is running out of steam and unemployment is severe , whilst inequality and poverty are on the rise .
I should like to draw your attention to two key facts , before making two proposals .
The situation we are facing today is comparable in the economic and social distress it is causing .
This is why we look to the Commission to adopt a position which is both easily understood and which is designed to prevent the breakdown of structures in areas which are heavily dependent on fishing .
Those reforms and that spirit of constructive change must form part of a sustainable development strategy that takes up the challenge posed by climate change and that appropriately addresses the issues of energy , transport and protection of the environment .
Partnership with third countries is only possible if based on a joint undertaking and in compliance with international law .
Ladies and gentlemen , next January , I shall appear before you in this House to present the EU’s strategic priorities .
You are aware , as I am , of populist threats coming from people who wish to weaken Europe and who always seek to call into question the credibility of our institutions .
If a Commissioner for taxation is not too familiar with his dossiers , that is no problem , Mr Barroso is here ’ .
Try to tread carefully .
It cannot be a surprise to anyone that the college of Commissioners presented to us only serves to exacerbate all of these reservations .
In fact , I firmly believe that , following the failure of the Santer Commission , then the stormy journey taken by the one that succeeded it , following the succession of increasingly bitter disputes between governments and the Commission , between governments themselves , between the Commission and Parliament , following numerous worrying signs of ‘eurofatigue ’ among the general public – to use an expression often heard in the new Member States – not least after the elections , which were notable for a record low turnout , and given the fact that the draft Constitution might not be ratified in a few days ’ time , I firmly believe that the Barroso syndrome , which will tomorrow lead to an historic defeat or to a Pyrrhic victory , constitutes a new and powerful indicator of the deep crisis of a Europe without vision and without a unifying plan .
The competition Commissioner , for example , is from a background of unbridled capitalism .
We are the representatives of the people and this is not an institutional crisis at all .
Mr Barroso , you have unfortunately fallen into the media trap of short sentences .
Finally , you are making a fundamental mistake , because one of the essential powers of your Commission is the one it will exercise in the field of competition .
Secondly , the team : everything possible has been said about the team , or almost .
I cannot accept a culture of intolerance , a culture of suspicion , simply because there are rumours or simply because there are attacks in our respective countries .
I have not given way entirely to those who wanted a shake-up , it is true , but I have gone a long way towards dealing with your concerns and I have given significant guarantees with regard to the substance , fundamental rights , civil liberties and non-discrimination .
That is what we must do .
In conclusion , nothing about the situation in the eurozone can justify this blank cheque for the ECB.
Inflation has picked up  – and whatever some people may have said , the introduction of the euro has unfortunately led to a rise in prices - exchange rates remain high and growth is weak .     .
Nevertheless , by providing this draft budget with such reduced funding and distributing money in a random manner , the Council is expecting us to abandon what we hold most dear in terms of European integration : solidarity .
Like Mrs Jensen , I must acknowledge everything she has contributed to the budgetary procedure , to its renewal and modernisation .
It concerns the Commission 's desire to launch a preparatory action in the field of managing the return of immigrants who are not authorised to remain in Union territory .
The irresponsibility of our Parliament will lead to an increase in France 's contribution to the Community budget of more than a billion euros
