, and the transfer of individual quotas to young farmers , while keeping them linked with the least favoured zones , should be facilitated .
The common organization of the tobacco market should , therefore , provide an incentive not to abandon existing activities and support the transfer of individual quotas to young farmers , while keeping them linked with the least favoured areas .
For this reason I consider that the Council should bring every necessary pressure to bear on the Cambodian authorities to revive the 1991 Paris Accords , and I am also convinced that the Commission must take on the task of ensuring that the election date of May 1998 is respected , which , we all hope , should bring this tragic situation to an end .
The case of Joseph O'Dell , a presumably innocent man condemned to the gallows in the sovereign State of Virginia , offers us the chance to prove they are wrong , the hope that our voice will be heard to save his life , the dream that our common resolution may begin to reverse the savage trend towards the judicial assassination of thousands .
To express this belief , on the recommendation of Amnesty International , people condemned to death are granted honorary citizenship of my city , Palermo , which for too long has been a city of death , affirming a culture of life .
It is not , to be sure , the first time ; we hope that , if not the last , then at least it will be one of the last times in which , in extremis , the actual legal situation of a person condemned to death is prevented from being verified .
Madam President , the case of Joseph O'Dell can be seen in two ways : first , as my colleagues have said , Joseph O'Dell may die an innocent man because American justice is making a point of not allowing a reassessment of the DNA evidence which would probably exculpate him ; second , we see the O'Dell case as a symbol of what the death penalty in the United States and elsewhere in the world stands for today : the death penalty as revenge of the State , a State crime , an outrage , as exercise of authority and arrogance with regard to a human life .
Madam President , we are voting for this resolution not only to confirm - as we always have - our opposition to the death penalty , a choice in favour of civilization which Parliament has made so many times , and out of the deep moral conviction we hold - the Pope recently , referring to this case , said that God alone is the master of Man 's life and death - but because , in this case , we feel it our duty as Members of the European Parliament to add our own initiative to avert the risk of a miscarriage of justice .
Without these reforms the elections will be a farce , and yet another enforced legitimization of the personal power of Arap Moi .
The popular drive for democracy and freedom of the individual is now being manifested forcefully throughout the African continent .
A peculiar form of persecution has grown up in this country : any person not identifying him or herself with the dominant party is actually prevented by the authorities and even by individuals from exercising such fundamental rights as freedom of movement and freedom of expression , although in theory these rights are recognized .
Madam President , not least thanks to the constant , courageous initiative of the European Parliament , the campaign for a total ban on anti-personnel landmines is gaining ground and could lead to significant results .
We ask the Commission and the Council to intensify their action to ensure that the blocking of the trade in landmines is scrupulously adhered to and that mine-clearing operations and action in support of populations affected by the consequences of landmines are strengthened .
Now , in the context of the Protocol on Social Policy , we find other recently established structures and procedures which have become an integral part of the process of laying down European legislation .
Of all alcoholic beverages , beer is the most dangerous , because people who drink it do not fully realize that they are consuming an alcoholic product .
Since , however , in this proposal there is , most appropriately , a reference to measures intended to protect the environment and reduce the use of plant protection products , improving quality and safeguarding European production , I fully agree with the report , even though some will undoubtedly be against it .
The language of art and architecture , particularly in their most varied and outstanding forms and expressions , can be seen as a universal language understood by all , enshrining values and principles of respect , peace , tolerance and solidarity .
But I also have to say that , from a 'cultural ' point of view , there is clearly a lack of strategic knowledge on how to integrate the resources .
In short , these regions ' best chance of affirming their cultural identity is through a process of cultural renewal .
Mr President , culture has long been the Cinderella of the structural funds .
The second point relates to the definition of the future structural policies of the Union .
But I think one comment is called for , and I am sure the rapporteur and the other speakers will agree with it .
It would be better to stimulate sensitivity to cultural factors in the most structured way possible , with the development , for example , of faculties for the restoration of cultural heritage , with registers of professionals , recognized throughout Europe , and diplomas or certificates which permit mobility of architects , restorers and so on
