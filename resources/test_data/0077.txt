Secondly , as I mentioned in my opinion on this matter , because this confirms the tendency for excessive concentration of budgetary appropriations of structural actions in the final years of this Community support framework .
This ability for mutual adaptation is what makes the difference between a Europe with a face , a personality , and a Europe which is completely faceless .
Secondly , the inclusion in the Treaty on European Union of an article which provides for modulation of policies and the adoption of measures that actually meet the specific and acknowledged needs of the ultra-peripheral regions .
Fifthly , we must really also make sure that we have funding for projects under the Cohesion Fund , which have yet to reach the ultra-peripheral regions despite the fact that they are the regions which are at the greatest disadvantage because of reductions in public spending stemming from the application of convergence criteria in order to bring in the single currency .
These difficulties were only recognised in the Maastricht Treaty by dint of their inclusion in an appended declaration .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , for the populations of islands such as the Azores and Madeira recognition of the status of ultra-peripheral regions is very important .
Since 1994 , recognition of these special features has been diminished because of changes made to the POSEI programmes ; the existing mechanisms and instruments were applied only to some of the areas where they could have been .
In respect of this aspect , our aim is to establish that the very bodies of the autonomous regions should be informed when legislative initiatives are being taken , so that the self-governing institutions can actually find out about proposals dealing with specific affairs relating to the regions before they are included on the Council 's order of business for discussion .
We are speaking in particular about their remoteness , insularity , small surface area , difficult relief and climate , which make them terribly dependent on the outside world and are reflected in the very low per capita income still registered in these regions , despite the very positive effects of POSEI programmes , in particular the POSEIMA programme applied in the Azores and Madeira .
Mr President , like previous speakers I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on his magnificent work .
However , I should like in particular , Mr President , to address my words to the Commissioner , Mrs Wulf-Mathies , who perfectly understands the problems of the regions , and I should like to point out to her that at this very time , in the Intergovernmental Conference , we must tackle the subject of the legal status of the ultra-peripheral regions .
Please remember the very special nature of this European population living thousands of kilometres away from the European heartland .
The latest information has confirmed the gradual increase in the importance of SMEs , which have shown themselves to be especially able to attract investment and create jobs in competitive industries .
But we must make an effort to adapt and this is something which must be done well ahead , with the vital support of the European Commission .
The Commission , on this score , in its most recent report , adopted a fundamental rule according to which it would act less in order to act better .
All measures consequently should be made dependent on objectives of common interest to be pursued by Community institutions .
This should not be regarded as a regulatory decision .
We must also be aware that , for merely technical reasons , it is not always possible to practise organic farming in many circumstances , especially in areas with small and very small farms .
Therefore we must make sure that the common agricultural policy , the CAP , evolves towards greater balance between these different components especially since , in the past and still today , it is profoundly unbalanced , as is demonstrated by 90 % of the budget earmarked for the prices and markets components and only 10 % for structures , not to mention the insignificant budgetary amount earmarked for quality policy and organic production .
We have to get used to Cork - as Mr Fantuzzi said - which is a kind of Vatican II .
It would be useful for the European Parliament to know exactly how the Member States apply in practice , on the ground , these measures which can only benefit the rationalisation and modernisation of our agriculture .
We regard as positive the changes made by the rapporteur , who we compliment on her excellent work , including support for the construction of infrastructures designed to save water in farming , changes to make exceptions for non-intensive farms , as is the case of pig farms , as well as the possible payment of aids to repair structural damage or destruction resulting from natural disasters .
It only provides for them in the case of farms larger than three hectares as a whole , and larger than two hectares in certain regions of Italy , France , Spain , Greece and Portugal .
Following loose directives , and the more or less binding directives of action programmes with good but inconsequential proposals , and from a cohesion fund targeting only four countries with the environment as its objective , we have gone to the creation of a genuine Community law .
If the States prove ineffective in the application of what , in this area , they themselves produce , they will be even less so in terms of what they are induced to introduce .
This shows the priceless advantage of combining environmental problems with the needs and features of local communities .
The Collins report heads in this direction and therefore I congratulate the rapporteur .
In fact , telecommunication
