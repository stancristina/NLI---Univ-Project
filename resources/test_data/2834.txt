A solution is not , however , a prerequisite for Cyprus 's accession .
That is a position which it is wise to adhere to , and so we all hope , and cross our fingers , that advantage will be taken of this 'window of opportunity ' , this unique opportunity which there will be this autumn to resolve this extremely old and tragic problem on this wonderful island .
I think that it is important that , in my answer , I should adhere entirely to the well-established and sensible formulation which was adopted in Helsinki and which has been repeated time and again , namely that a solution to the Cyprus problem will facilitate the accession of Cyprus , but that a solution is not a prerequisite for accession .
That is what can be said , and I think that everyone understands what is meant , and I have nothing to add .
I would like to emphasise that the negotiations have certainly not broken down .
Nor will I accept the description of Ankara 's shadow .
It will not be affected by any shadow .
The Council is aware that the Greek minority in Albania claims property rights in the same way as other citizens .
Pursuant to Article 181 of the Albanian constitution , the Albanian Parliament must adopt laws before the end of November with a view to finding a fair solution to questions concerning expropriations and confiscations that took place before the constitution was adopted .
The Albanian Parliament has set up a special committee on the restoration of property .
This committee is now starting to scrutinise the legislation with a view to restoration of , or compensation for , property which was seized under Communist rule .
The Council is fully aware that a solution to the property question is also an essential prerequisite for encouraging domestic and foreign investments in Albania , just as it is a prerequisite for the development of agriculture .
On 13 May of this year , the Council approved the recommendations in this report and requested that rapid progress should be made in each of these areas over the next few years .
Albania is the EU 's partner in the stabilisation and association process .
Here , the EU has the opportunity to stress the importance which is attached to solving this issue , now that the country is starting to approach integration into Europe , at the same time as acquiring closer ties with the EU.
The constitution envisages that a solution will be found .
The Council has expressed its opinion , and there is an ongoing dialogue between the EU and Albania , in the context of which I promised here a little while ago that the EU would ensure that Albania pursued the measures promised .
There is therefore no question of either the Greek minority or others being left in the lurch or forgotten .
It was a little shorter than the first one , but no less binding .
I should like to answer Question 6 by Mr Carlos Lage .
This also applies to public-order measures which the Member States take when meetings of the European Council are held within their territory .
As regards the second question , I would like to refer to the Executive Committee Decision of 20 December 1995 on the procedure for applying Article 2( 2 ) of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement , which has a long reference number which I do not want to read out .
It constitutes a part of the so-called Schengen rules , and it is thus binding for all Schengen States .
Incidentally , it is published in OJ L 239 of 22 September 2000 , page 133 .
I can state that the Danish Presidency reserves the right to make use of this possibility .
Let us hope that this sets a trend for the future .
The Schengen cooperation means that the countries undertake to maintain open borders in respect of each other , except when there are exceptional reasons for temporary closure .
The Council and I regard the possibility of temporary closure as reasonable .
We must protect democratic gatherings .
If I may venture to answer as a Danish minister : I do not think that , in connection with the weekend meeting in Elsinore , we made any use whatsoever of the possibility under the Schengen rules of closing the borders .
Demonstrators were completely free to enter ; but fortunately only peaceful demonstrators came , and that is something I think we should be pleased about .
Both the Member States and the EU institutions are obliged to incorporate equal opportunities for men and women in all EU policies and programmes , and the European Council has on several occasions set out guidelines for a special strategy in this field .
That also applies to pre-accession programmes .
The Member of the European Parliament may apply directly to the Commission if she wishes to have a fuller overview of the specific programmes .
It covers the aid which will be given through the EU 's various financial instruments .
During the negotiations on the chapter on employment and industrial relations policy , the Union has stressed the importance which this section has for the equal treatment of men and women , and it has also been emphasised how necessary it is for the candidate countries to comply with the rules in this field .
Recently , the Council concerning agriculture , that is to say the Agricultural Ministers Council , at its meeting on 27 May of this year , adopted specific conclusions on the integration of the equality aspect into the Common Agricultural Policy .
The Council expressly recognised in these conclusions that women play a bigger and bigger role in the rural districts , and it calls on the Commission to use the Structural Funds to continue
