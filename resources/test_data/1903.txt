March 2004 – that a European observatory should be set up to monitor organised crime and to propose ways of harmonising the laws on punishing it across the European Union .     – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am speaking on behalf of the new Italian Socialist Party .
Furthermore , we must at last hold that complex and comprehensive debate on choosing technologies for the future and on the production and use of alternative and renewable energies .
Although it will be very difficult to reopen a debate that is now closed , when the Council comes to formally approve the reform , it must consider the possibility of including some of the vital amendments proposed by Parliament to improve the text .
These include , for instance , maintaining the intervention system until 2010 ; varying compensatory aid according to production ; making it mandatory to allocate at least 50 % of the restructuring aid to sugar beet and chicory growers , to offset their loss of income ; and reformulating the conditions for access to the restructuring system through the signing of a trade agreement with the sugar beet and chicory growers .     – Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I too should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report .
As you know , we have recently put forward a draft framework decision on data protection under the third pillar .
Once again , however , I must point out the extent to which the role of the European Parliament has been undervalued , in that all too often it has been bypassed by the Council and by the Commission itself .
With that we could implement a policy that combines the goals of reform with those of social justice in the best way possible and without unexpected and excessive trauma .
The compromise that has been reached is much more balanced than the Commission ’s proposal in June and it provides for a series of positive measures : the chance to retain a proportion of coupled aid for those who continue producing ; the support measures for sugar beet growers ; the attention given to the regions penalised by the dismantling of the industry ; and the creation of a diversification fund .
It is important to be able to predict the future realistically and not merely to manage the present .
A common environmental policy is needed within the Union , just as it is also needed by the Union in relation to the rest of the world , because it is one of the duties and objectives that we set ourselves during the Convention’s work on the Treaty .
They are still here !
They are riding on a credibility crisis that has alienated too many citizens from institutions that they consider distant and governed by an all-powerful but inept bureaucracy .
We have to defend ourselves by enhancing internal cooperation , not only through judicial and policing initiatives , but above all by means of political action to make the Union a key player in bringing peace to the Middle East .
That is a fallacy , a deception that we have seen before from those who actually have a hidden agenda and from those in the Member States that do not want to accept their own responsibilities .
We might otherwise run the risk of showing total acquiescence .
The ALDE Group believes that port services must be covered by a Community legislative framework which takes account of their particular conditions .
I am well aware , of course , that all the political groups are equal , but evidently some are more ‘equal ’ than others .
The European Union cannot act on matters of values , culture and the family as if it were dealing with the single market , asking the Member States to legalise homosexual unions for the sake of uniformity and a misplaced duty to protect people’s rights ; instead , it would be running the risk of undermining the system of values that lies at the heart of our age-old society .     – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted against the resolution , and on this subject I have to agree with Minister Tremaglia , who once said that ‘poofs’ , or at least those who support them , are in the majority in Europe .
No Plan D will be a success if , in addition to the ‘D’ for ‘debate’ , ‘dialogue ’ and ‘democracy’ , it does not also include ‘D’ for ‘delivery’ .
Delivery is the best context in which to recast the text of the Constitution , and the best way to make people understand just how useful Europe can be .
We are also reflecting in order to better understand what we must do tomorrow , but we must be careful not to let that be an excuse for any inaction on our part today , or we would risk invalidating all our reflection , no matter how clever it might be .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance supports the Duff-Voggenhuber report .
I therefore believe that the two amendments tabled by the rapporteurs should be supported by a large majority in this Parliament , because they simply state that it is possible to debate various options .
I should like to thank the Austrian Presidency for having at last partly resurrected the debate .
The constructive relations that we shall be able to develop with our neighbours in fact represent the only prospect for creating peace and security around our borders .
Security , energy , immigration , the environment and human rights require vision and political dialogue , as well as specific institutions in order to be able to make progress together .
