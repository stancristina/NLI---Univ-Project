the Committee on the Environment took over the relevant proposal from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy .
In this connection , in all its opinions and reports Parliament has strongly advocated tax incentives .
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy considered the issue in the light of industrial competitiveness as well , and noted that if the European automobile industry does not develop new technologies rapidly , the Japanese will .
The Swedish and Finnish Governments have commissioned a study which shows that the petroleum industry has overestimated the cost of producing cleaner fuels .
The result achieved now by Parliament during the first reading will provide an extremely solid basis for the subsequent readings .
In Finland , very substantial , and successful , efforts have been made to encourage the use of lead-free petrol and I can tell you that the quality of Finnish fuels already exceeds the proposed standards .
In the proposal for a directive , summer begins on 1 April and ends on 30 September .
I am pleased to see that the amendments I tabled in the Committee on Research , Technological Development and Energy concerning derogations with regard to the winter and summer periods have been taken into account in the form of amendments tabled by the Green Group .
In southern Finland , spring may already be fairly well advanced , but in northern Finland , i .e . more than 1000 km further north , this is certainly not the case .
That is certainly not its objective .
The inclusion in the directive of a fuel suitable for use in an Arctic climate would eliminate this problem .
This is why it is precisely this source of pollution which must be tackled if we are deal effectively with a problem which affects many Europeans , i .e . polluted urban air which poses a danger to health .
European consumers are extremely well informed about the technological scope for improving the quality of the air .
As this debate has shown , both are needed , and this also goes to explain why the Auto-Oil programme covers the whole issue of the technical development of vehicles and the improvement of fuels .
Parliament is proposing , for example , that the Community should adopt a new way of thinking , involving the use of tax instruments to achieve better air quality at a reasonable price .
In order to encourage everyone else , I can say that this has been achieved in a short space of time and at a genuinely reasonable cost .
.
I should like the word 'and ' at the beginning of the sentence to be changed to 'but ' . This does not change the substance of the amendment , but clarifies its thrust .
Nobody described this situation better than the former President of Finland .
in writing .
By improving the quality of fuels , the quality of the air can quickly be enhanced , in particular by reducing emissions from older vehicles .
The Commission 's calculations also disregard external environmental costs .
Just before Finland 's accession to the EU , the former President of Finland , Mauno Koivisto , pointed out in this room , that when the cherry trees are blossoming in Strasbourg people are still cross-country skiing in Finland .
It is also proposing the incorporation of a special cold-weather test in the automobiles directive .
The further consideration of the directive must encompass a study to determine whether a quality classification should be introduced for machinery or whether the Commission should indeed draw up a separate proposal .
Lange report ( A4-116/97 ) Madame President , the Russians find themselves in a strange situation .
Finnish aid shipments have run into major problems at the border - either the Russian customs officials are conspicious by their absence , or duties are simply collected illegally by locals , something which the Russian authorities should put a stop to immediately .
In most cases , exactly the opposite occurred : people bought the Western foodstuffs with what were probably their last remaining savings , but the money went into the pockets of the Russian mafia .
Madame President , famine is now a fact of life in areas close to Europe .
From the beginning of the year onwards , emergency aid has been sent to the region from Finland via the Red Cross and the Finland-Russia Association .
A programme to develop social and health administration in Karelia is currently been financed via the EU 's TACIS programme .
The number of organizations is large , and relations between them are poorly coordinated .
Expectations regarding the ability of these organizations to foster economic integration and development are often too high , particularly as regards the amount of time this may take .
In theory , the European Union has a good chance of fostering sound economic integration , provided it remembers that integration as practised by the European industrialized countries cannot serve as a model for the integration of the developing countries .
I should also like to emphasize the need to take political factors into account .
In the context of support for the economic integration of the developing countries , the European Union 's main task cannot be to open up broader markets for its own Member States , thereby hampering the development of the economy and production in the developing countries .
Mr President , I was already beginning to suspect somewhat that this whole field might fall outside your ambit , but fortunately this proves not to be the case .
In order for the principle of mainstreaming to be acted upon , information is needed about the present state of equality between the sexes , and impact analyses also need to be developed .
