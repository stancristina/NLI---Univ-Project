a common position in December .
I should like to express my very sincere thanks to the three rapporteurs and to say a few words on two or three specific points .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it has been one bit of bad news after the other .
The flags are at half-mast already , and I do not expect a rapid result at any price but rather the best possible result within the shortest possible time .
If the author of the amendment agrees , we could proceed in that way .
Let me pre-empt any misinterpretation of my vote as an expression of opposition to women 's participation in the peaceful resolution of conflicts .
We should then , at a later stage , carry out a very detailed assessment , particularly since we do not even have the texts yet .
I believe that we need to be present in the discussion process of the coming week and that we should put forward our critical or perhaps also positive arguments , without drawing any conclusions .
( Applause )
Neither is it about legalistic hair-splitting ; it is about an eminently political question , which it does not require any legal training to answer .
This legal basis , too , is completely worthless in my opinion , and that is why the unions , companies and colleagues here are right to refer to job losses .
Consequently , I can say on behalf of my group that we do not wish to accept any amendments .
This was the European Parliament 's objective in the legislative procedure on clinical trials , and I believe that today we can say that this objective has been achieved .
Then a distinction has to be drawn between children and adults who are incapable of giving informed consent .
But I was keen to hear whether the Council could accept it , if that were perhaps possible .
That is why we should perhaps consider once again whether it is right for us to vote in favour of this initiative .
There now appear to be no further obstacles to Parliament 's passing a resolution on the European Union budget for 2001 on Thursday .
The Commission has submitted its analysis of outstanding commitments and its strategy for eliminating abnormal outstanding commitments .
We refused to allow our other foreign policy priorities to be whittled away still further .
Having been allocated so little time , which is a pity because the budget - and the rapporteurs - deserve more than a derisory two and a half minutes , I must confine myself to just a few comments .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , unlike the negotiations in Nice , a substantial result was achieved on the 2001 budget in a single joint night sitting .
I am positive that no such success would have been possible with the old concept of bilateral friendships , with Member States being played off against each other .
The agricultural ministers meeting in emergency session have proposed new measures in the wake of the BSE crisis , but we are all agreed that it makes no sense to postpone the resolution on the budget in order to include these new measures and that a supplementary budget will be submitted post haste in order to fund the necessary measures .
It is also a commitment vis-Ã -vis the Council .
The main sources of this pressure are unemployment , the BSE crisis and the Balkan stability pact .
( Applause from the right ) We witnessed an Intergovernmental Conference which dragged on for months , followed by a summit in Nice at which we felt , even as we watched on television , that the Heads of State and Government - and this is a perfectly human trait - had reached the end of their physical and mental resources .
We take you at your word , President Chirac , and I was delighted to hear that you want to involve the European Parliament closely in the post-Nice process .
While waiting for the outcome from Nice , I was put in mind of my old mathematics professor .
However , what is worrying in this situation , and this is something which both I and Mr Poettering have warned against , is that the instrument of reinforced cooperation may be used as a circumvention strategy in areas in which no decision can be reached by a qualified majority .
Before the vote on Amendment No 22 :
The decision-making mechanism in the Council of Ministers has become far more complicated and the hurdles have been raised .
For the rest , when it comes to law-making , the future Council of Ministers must be an open , parliamentary organisation in which transparency and scrutiny have their place , because we cannot carry on as we are .
President Chirac referred to Heads of Government who point out that public opinion still does not understand or accept more or a different sort of progress .
( The President cut the speaker off )
What involvement ?
That might have made it easier to find reasonable compromises here .
We all know that .
My second comment relates to the common foreign and security policy .
On Mr Mulder 's comment : you noted that , because the budget at second reading was below the margin in agricultural policy , the risk of a change in exchange rates needed to be included in the calculation , because it would be not unwelcome if the euro were to rise against the dollar .
I think it is a good thing that we have succeeded in activating the flexibility instruments and giving Serbia the help it needs on this occasion , although I fully agree with you that our strategy must be such that we prevent the phenomenon from arising whereby a European flexibility instrument wanders from one region or country of Europe to another , depending on where it is needed
