our budgetary law , the financial regulation and the commitments entered into .
The idea of creating a contingency reserve , given the imponderable nature of these markets , was originally Parliament 's .
But that is only the second cheapest solution .
We too can take the tram now .
Firstly , a mistake was made at the checkpoint here on the way into the Chamber .
Surely it cannot be possible for an individual , who has been identified , not to be banned from entering this House !

Italy , with 21 parties in the European Parliament , is represented by the greatest number of parties .
One of these is for statutes to be submitted , providing evidence that a European party is committed to the principles of democracy , respect for fundamental rights and control of income and expenditure , which are enshrined in the Treaty on European Union .
I should very much like to hand it over to the President of Parliament .
I should like to express my heartfelt thanks to Ursula Schleicher , who by working unbelievably hard in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs under the Chairmanship of our esteemed colleague , Mr Napolitano , managed to forge agreement on majority positions .
Parliament 's Bureau will , as you know , after consulting a committee of eminent persons , advise on the basis on which it will be decided which organisations are genuinely European parties which comply with the criteria .
I do not think that this is the case .
If , in accordance with Rule 143 of the Rules of Procedure , the inadmissibility - due to legal shortcomings - of a specific item on the agenda is once moved and agreed , then in my view there is no possibility of magically reinstating it on the agenda by means of Rule 111 Paragraph 2 of the Rules of Procedure .
The Regulation helps to increase transparency in respect of the funding of political work , create greater clarity , and separate group and party work , something which the European People 's Party - my friend Alejandro Agag has spoken about this - has been working hard to achieve for some time already , harder than the other parties .
As you know , we opted for a twin-track approach .
Nevertheless , we do need to guarantee of course that this does not once again lead to covert party financing .
Funds are granted by the Commission in accordance with the usual rules .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , when we Members think of the Council of the European Union we are by no means always filled with a deep sense of happiness .
Money launderers must feel just as vulnerable as polluters .
After Europol , the creation of Eurojust is a further important step towards combating organised cross-border crime in Europe more effectively .
Only in this way can a superfluous juxtaposition of two systems with the same area of responsibility be avoided in the long term .
She has proposed that Luxembourg should be the seat .

These are the watchwords of the 'pensions reform ' .
Mr President , Algeria has a turbulent history .
Traditionally , Berbers have cultivated their own culture and identity and have maintained a substantial measure of independence in Kabylie .
Dayton was the result , and led - as we believed - to the founding of a new state .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , today we are discussing an incident concerning a mosque .
Hundreds of thousands of people were expelled , and there are still half a million displaced persons in Bosnia who have not returned home .
The moderates are stronger , and we must give them our support .
The second point which we must be clear about - as Doris Pack has already mentioned - is refugee return .
On the contrary , the incidents make it even more difficult to attract the funds which Bosnia so urgently needs , and on which it continues to depend .
Abandoning these projects would merely give fresh impetus to the extremists in Bosnia , who are also hostile to projects of this kind .
Could you tell us why we will be voting at 6.30 p.m. when the debate is likely to finish at around 5.10 or 5.15 p.m. ?
Mr President , press freedom is undoubtedly one of the bases of any functioning democracy .
The diplomatic representation called on the government to clarify recent events by carrying out a comprehensive , neutral investigation
