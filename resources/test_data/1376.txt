will be France , to continue developing this work and to reach a decision by the end of the year .
As regards the decision-making procedure in the European Parliament , there is broad consensus that no revision of the Treaty should be effected which involves changing the existing institutional balance .
It should be recalled that the conclusions of the Helsinki European Council specify that the Council presidency will submit a report to the European Council and may propose in this report the insertion of new items on the IGC' s agenda .
However , there is clear disagreement between , on one hand , the small and medium-sized Member States which want a Commission composed of one national from each Member State , all with equal status , and , on the other , the large Member States which favour a fixed number of Commissioners regardless of the number of Member States .
The idea submitted by this House of the Commission being able to request a vote of confidence in it was positively welcomed .
This is a common concern of all the Member States , whether large or small , not only due to the need , in ratifying the new Treaty , to enable enlargement and respect for its timetables , but also due to the feeling that a European crisis should not be allowed to occur on this type of reform .
Although this issue comes up time and again , it is very abstract .
As you can see , the Portuguese Presidency is continuing to make every effort to take the work forward in order to achieve a comprehensive and balanced agreement which is acceptable to everyone by the specified deadline .
It is good that the Council common position already incorporates some of the amendments approved by the European Parliament .
The European Parliament report also proposes , to ensure consumer protection , that operators or organisations producing and marketing minced beef , beef trimmings or cut beef should also be subject to the compulsory labelling system .
If only these promises could be fulfilled .
These are the reduction in tax and the obligation to pay employment contributions and the effective deregulation and removal of red tape , thereby stimulating entrepreneurial initiative and promoting growth .
However , as this was not possible , I will speak now .
I have the highest respect for her but she must also respect us .
So what is different ?
This is the secret of the unequalled peace and progress which we have enjoyed , based firstly on a common culture of human rights , democracy , the rule of law and free markets and , secondly , on strict mutual respect with no trampling over other countries .
It would be wrong to strip away the rules of the game which have brought us so much success to date .
Finally , I must mention the idea of transnational European parties .
We need to be careful , for federalism is so dazzling that it destroys with its hands those concepts which it asserts with its own mouth .
Although the majority of the proposals aim to enable and reinforce the joint progress and the integration process in this new and complex framework , and these are to be applauded , there are others which are not so great .
These are essential to guarantee a balance between small and large Member States and even between the dual legitimacy of a union of peoples and a union of States .
I would therefore like to encourage the presidency to continue working to ensure that the Member States understand how vital it is that more questions are decided by qualified majority and that there is greater flexibility in EU decision-making .
Mr President , the situation in the Horn of Africa , and particularly in Ethiopia , is reaching a level of drama rarely exceeded .
They must also guarantee that this aid reaches those for whom it is really intended .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , today ' s debate was very important as a way of demonstrating the commitment and attention which this House gives to humanitarian issues , particularly the one discussed today .
Specifically we want to try and establish a more integrated and coordinated vision of all the issues now affecting the African continent about which we are concerned .
The problems cannot be solved through ad hoc actions and one-off interventions .
The Council presidency has no knowledge of this issue .
The European Union is not a country .
The Portuguese have always had to learn the languages of the people with whom they were dealing and , in turn , they brought a European language , Portuguese , to the four corners of the world and it is spoken today by two hundred million people .
It considers the knowledge of other languages to be intrinsic to the construction of a European citizenship , since it opens the door to a greater knowledge of other people ' s cultures and encourages tolerance and peaceful coexistence .
By these means , what we might call a compromise text was agreed , which gives every reason to suppose that a second reading and a conciliation procedure will not be necessary .
These points also require urgent consideration by the Community institutions .
Mr President , it is important for this House to approve Mr Dary ' s report , as the Commission proposal to introduce a tariff only system for banana imports by 2006 is unacceptable .
Should the European agricultural model not be used to safeguard banana production in the European Union which will certainly be threatened by the liberalisation being proposed ?
If banana production were to cease on the island of Madeira , it would represent an enormous environmental catastrophe as well as a serious loss of income for thousands of families
