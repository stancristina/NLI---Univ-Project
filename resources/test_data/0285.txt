Unemployment is still far too high , and no satisfactory solution has been found to the issue of aid to shipbuilding either .
In Finland we organized a hearing on the IGC for nongovernmental organizations , at which employment was seen as being by far the most important issue .
The Federation of Municipalities says that the IGC should ensure that greater account is taken of employment aspects in the EU 's activities , in accordance with the principle of transparency .
The employment objective is also supported by social organizations and even pensioners ' organizations .
At the hearing , it was also observed that the area of forest in the EU and the capacity of its forestry industry had doubled when the new Member States joined the Union .
However , a common strategy , for example with regard to timber certification , could benefit the sector .
Mr President , all these demands have been put forward by members of the public .
Mr President , it was very exciting to sit on the committee during this work , because the issue in question is a very significant one , both from the point of view of economic policy and in many other respects .
We consider it quite appropriate for taxation of mineral oils , for example , to be used as an instrument of environmental policy , while taxation of alcohol and tobacco of course can promote health .
Our chairman , Mr von Wogau , has just spoken very warmly about the differences among cultures and the various traditions in respect of alcohol .
Despite that , I consider that there are no objective grounds for completely exempting one type of alcohol from excise .
In the case of tobacco there is the strange exception to which Mrs Peijs referred , namely that hand-rolling tobacco is taxed much more lightly .
Why should it be exempt from excise ?
In my opinion excise is a very appropriate source , also from the point of view of maintaining balance in the public finances .
The consideration of the report has been constructive , and indeed inventive , at every stage , for which I should like to thank Mrs Thyssen .
However , the fact is of course that not much direct Union funding has been available , for example , to deal with the main difficult problems , when one bears in mind that at present the worst funding problems of all lie precisely in the fields of obtaining equity capital and venture capital and - in my country at least - excessive cautiousness on the part of the banks when it comes to extending credit .
Economic policy has been relatively successful since accession , so that there has been scope for funding of commercial ventures too .
Crossborder payments must of course be put in order immediately .
It does not make sense to delay matters .
EMU should not be blocked by formal obstacles .
It is quite clear that international cooperation is important in all fields .
Entrepreneurship is clearly a positive phenomenon , psychologically too .
It would be gratifying if active efforts were also made at European level to establish contacts between SME entrepreneurs and trade unions .
It could also be a new source of added value .
Madam President , the case of Alexander Nikitin is also particularly important to us because he has participated in the EU 's TACIS work with the Bellona organization .
Amnesty has investigated the figures quoted by Nikitin in Bellona 's report , and confirmed that they are based on publicly documented sources .
He is likely to be sentenced in October or November to up to 25 years ' imprisonment , and now is really the time to act .
This trip was scheduled for the end of October , but unfortunately nothing has come of it this time , as it was impossible to establish good cooperation with the local authorities .
The issue is topical , and I hope that Members of this House will be able to familiarize themselves with the matters on account of which Alexander Nikitin has been groundlessly imprisoned .
In my view , your statement that it is understandable that he should be absent when the Baltic is to be debated during the elections is unjustified .
I should therefore like to say something about the northern part of the Gulf of Bothnia , which is one of Europe 's growing 'economic arcs ' .
The area 's GDP is growing considerably more rapidly than the averages for Finland and Sweden ; its annual export earnings exceed 18 billion Finnish marks .
European regional policy has contributed a good deal to this dynamic development .
Madam President , I should like finally to stress that in order for export industries to function all the year round it is necessary to develop the infrastructure .
Only now do we find ourselves in a situation where genuinely concerted efforts are possible .
The EU has joined in the work of the Council of Baltic Sea States , which has created new opportunities .
At the same time as support is provided for the construction measures of the Baltic States and Poland , which seek accession , it must be ensured that Russia too can join in cooperation .
In addition to their desire to accede to the EU , the Baltic States have expressed the wish to join NATO .
This would directly increase instability in the Baltic .
A good example of the new type of action is IFOR in Bosnia , which is composed not only of NATO peace-keepers but also of contingents from Russia , the Baltic States and the non-aligned countries .
Madam President , thank you for your courtesy .
Further to what Mr Pelttari has said , I should like to add
