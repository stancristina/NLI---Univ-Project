Consequently , you need have no concerns on that account and the thematic strategy on waste truly is a step forward .
Many of the proposals are reflected in the Commission communication .
The Commission communication is the third and final stage in a detailed review procedure which has lasted over 18 months and in which many interested agencies have participated from the whole of Europe .
These aspects are indeed very important , given that non-sustainable environmental trends constitute some of the main threats in relation to our present and future prosperity .
Sustainable development addresses issues which truly relate to citizens .
They want prosperity but they also want a clean environment , good health , social protection and justice .
Both the Lisbon Strategy and the sustainable development strategy are predicated on implementing this objective in a fast-changing world .
We wish to go beyond words and to identify priorities for the next five years .
The other recipe is not to be conciliatory .
Make sure they do not drag you into new ventures in the Middle East and do not , of course , try to resurrect the Constitution .
No to the strong euro which prevents industrial growth and no , of course , to the high interest rates which are ruining households .
We MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece reject the decisions on the financial perspectives for 2007-2013 , because they are to the detriment of the peoples and their rights .
However , it is a fact that the EU itself and the governments of the Member States have concluded secret agreements with the USA , have fallen in fully with the so-called anti-terrorist strategy and are now trying to play at being surprised and innocent doves .
The ‘self-handling ’ proposal is absolutely unacceptable .
I wish to express the opinion that the dialogue which we need to hold must revolve not around the Constitution but around the existential problems of the European Union , which are : firstly , the degree to which the European Union is still necessary ; secondly , if the European Union is necessary , what type of European Union do we want and , thirdly , how enlarged a European Union do we want .
If the citizens of the European states do not realise the importance to mankind of the existence and further unification and strengthening of the European Union , then I predict that no constitutional proposal will be accepted in future .
It is time we got to work .
On the contrary , in my opinion there should only be one final objective to this period of reflection .
That is why we consider that the pronouncement about protecting human rights is hypocritical .
What we want to point out is simply that all these incidents are the result of the application of the ‘anti-terrorist ’ measures , the ultimate objective of which is not to combat so-called terrorism , but to terrorise the peoples as a whole .     – Mr President-in-Office of the Council , the highly reliable BBC referred to the incidents which you too wish to learn about .
Do you , as President-in-Office of the Council , intend to communicate with the authorities in these two Member States , so that they can tell the Council what happened ?     – Mr President-in-Office of the Council , you spoke for six minutes , but you spoke in very general , very 'round ' terms .
It is known in every country in Europe , thousands of people from all political areas have condemned it , it is a new fascist text which equates Nazism with communism , it is disrespectful to millions of communist victims who sacrificed their lives to conquer fascism , it criminalises the political action and ideology of communists and , precisely – as you referred to Article 6 – it infringes fundamental democratic rights .
We must do everything we can to prevent the Member States from taking a customer-orientated approach on the basis of their individual national interests .
The European Neighbourhood Policy should not produce overlaps or create confusion as to the European prospects and the future integration into the European Union of the Balkan countries .
The European Neighbourhood Policy needs to develop in a process with the participation of the citizens and of third country communities .
Particular account should be taken of the human rights situation and the situation of the Greek ethnic group in the Tsalka area of Georgia , where there are serious problems with both the human rights and property rights of the Greek community .     – Mr President , I too wish to thank the Commissioner and the rapporteur , Mr Tannock , for their integrated positions .
In this way , the European Union would create around it a large zone of peace , freedom and prosperity .
It could also be the way in which the countries on the periphery of Europe will converge more quickly with Europe .
However , I should also like to welcome the initiative by the Austrian Presidency in immediately defining the European Charter for Small Enterprises , so that specialised initiatives and measures can be promoted to strengthen the competitiveness and employment in the European Union .
Commissioner , small - and medium-sized enterprises live and work in the shadow of multinationals , of large chains , and in the shadow of bureaucracy .
Finally , strengthening incentives for the integration of innovation and research , on the basis of the proposals of the Commission itself on competitiveness and national aid and within the framework of the 7th research programme .
The possibility of military intervention against Iran would be disastrous and must be prevented , because another war in the area would create a chain reaction for security and peace , and not
