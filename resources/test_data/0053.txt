do the other members of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism and its new chairman , Mr Caveri , and as did the previous chairman , Mr Hatzidakis , for their collective efforts to make the management of regional policy and Structural Funds more straightforward and more efficient .
The truth , and I want to be honest about this , as I always am before this House , is that a five-month deadline to draft a document that is intended to cover a seven-year period was not realistic , when you understand the tough challenges involved and the amounts involved in the Structural Funds .
It is in the light of this reminder that I must examine certain proposals that you have put forward , Mr Pohjamo .
Along with enlargement , Europe is therefore in need of greater solidarity .
Depending on how the Heads of State and Government respond to the question of cohesion , depending on whether we maintain , or even extend , the cohesion policy , whether we scale it down or take it apart , we will somehow answer this broad question - one of the subjects to be tackled by the Convention , which we will also be attending - on the future of Europe .
On this issue too , I await your ideas , but I have explained my outlook .
I will say once again that I am committed to proposing , at the appropriate time , a fair , Community-wide solution so that we can continue to assist the regions which are situated just below the new eligibility threshold .
This should , therefore , be done earlier than usual , so that we can , as I said before , begin to turn the new programming period into a reality on the ground , as soon as the new Agenda begins in 2007 , rather than two years after that .
We cannot merely focus on accounting and notarial-oriented matters when discussing a subject of this importance , when the Americans are pouring millions of dollars into their aerospace and space industry .
If this amendment received a favourable vote , we could not vote for the report thus amended .
The right to knowledge and , consequently , the right to know how to read , write and count are part of this Charter .
It is in its dual role of ensuring openness and acting as a social instrument that the Social Agenda is a key component of economic and social modernisation , as its implementation will , in the long term , be decisive for achieving the strategic objectives laid down by the Lisbon European Council .
However , any headway is progress , and I also welcome the comments in the report of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs concerning the social policy agenda .
In the discussions between the various groups , the European Commission was given the task of reforming the CEMT permit system , but this role has been omitted from the text of the resolution .

In spite of these arguments , the final decision on the development of the Galileo project has been deferred from Council to Council , and the latest , held at Laeken , was no exception .
On a practical level , we will be able to use this system in areas as varied as transport , fisheries , agriculture , telecommunications , oil exploration , defence and civil protection activities .
This project is a perfect illustration of one of the domains in which European cooperation is vital .
Member States which may have had the diplomatic ability to act are becoming paralysed by the collective mechanisms of the Union , which can only produce joint statements .
All these actions have a common goal : to destroy democratic systems by means of terror .
In September 2001 , in the ' Millennium Declaration ' , the international community committed itself to halving poverty by 2015 .
I feel , for example , that Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo would have been much happier if the House had elected him by secret ballot , as the President of Parliament and you yourself , Mr Vice-President , were elected .
There is a point , however , to which the Napolitano report claims , according to the explanatory statement , to have brought 'an extremely important innovation ' : that is , the proposal of some sort of 'joint constituent power ' .
Cohesion should , in this regard , be even greater if we want to avoid these disparities between regions dramatically increasing upon enlargement .
For , as the European Commission points out , enlargement will increase the development differential between the centrally located territories , on the one hand , and the peripheral and outermost regions on the other .

( FR ) Whilst recognising the fact that knowing how to read and write is a right for all , the report will be of little help in promoting a policy that can really make a difference in the fight against illiteracy .
Furthermore , I would also say to Mr Souladakis that , in this case , balance is no real guarantee of democracy .
We must bear in mind that this is a humanitarian and ecological disaster , which has occurred at a time when 80 % of the farm workers had finished sowing their wheat and corn .
Lastly , since cooperation between the European Union and the Democratic Republic of Congo is now being resumed , I think that we must push our partners to bring an end to conflict and to establish a fair and lasting peace .
This is what the Americans are trying to do at Guantanamo Bay .
I do not think that this is a matter for the Council alone
