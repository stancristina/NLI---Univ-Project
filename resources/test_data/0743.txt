promote the Centre for Disease Prevention and Control , so that the European Union can respond in a coordinated manner to health threats and to terrorist threats .
It also makes provision in foreign policy for a Minister for Foreign Affairs .
We are talking about history , we are not talking about the future .
No one knows what will happen in the future .
We believe that all the Member States should have a Commissioner .
The third point , which is also unthinkable , is the saga about the presidency of the Council .
I prefer the current system , under which each country has the ambition to make its own contribution to European developments .
So much for those who want to keep talking about the cultural burden of Europe .
In this sense , therefore , it has two very important elements which it must promote , in order to open prospects for the future .
That brings us to the Thessaloniki Summit .
In this sense , it is a telling issue and we cannot deal with it as a secondary issue , because , whether we like it or not , we consider the future of Europe and the Convention to be a primary issue .
In this sense , the Community method and its variations must be reinforced .
On 17 February , it was declared that the problem with Iraq was its disarmament , and this provoked Mr Bush 's congratulations .
So what if no weapons of mass destruction were found .
I say nine-and-a-half because Cyprus is joining as a divided country , but that is an insignificant detail , which we should not allow to overshadow the glory of Great Europe .
This is their response to the attack on all the rights the working classes have acquired over the last 100 years .
It would be an oversight on my part not to refer to the farce of the Convention , with the careful election of its members so as to drown any voice of opposition to the European Union , which the President of the Convention is openly leading by the hand .
However much of a fiesta they become , however many repressive measures are taken to protect the leaders from the love of the crowd , however far from the city the summit is held , the thunderous voice of protest will not be muzzled , the resistance of the gathering anti-imperialist , anti-monopolistic forces will not be repressed .
The draft Constitutional Treaty is of primary importance and we hope the Convention will arrive at an integrated proposal which will get the European Union out of its identity crisis , rather than merely at a list of alternative solutions .
On the question of asylum and immigration , the thinking behind the United Kingdom draft on asylum reform , which literally leaves the 1951 Geneva Convention in tatters , should be rejected .
Finally , I think the agenda of the EU-USA summit should include : first , the abolition of the death penalty in the United States , secondly , the treatment of the prisoners in Guantanamo and , thirdly , what we called here in this House the lie of the century , by which I mean the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq .
This is the last day the Greek Presidency and I personally shall attend the European Parliament .
First of all , the issue of the western Balkans .
Consequently , we want the outcome of the meeting to give impetus to the integration procedure , to signal policies and , of course , for there to be appropriate funding to support the efforts of these countries in moving forward .
As far as the issues of immigration are concerned , this is a huge problem for Europe which , if not overshadowed by political developments concerning Iraq over the last six months , will continue to be a heavyweight issue , as it was at the end of the last Presidency .
We must strike a balance between immigrants living in the European area legally and our societies .
Indeed , Thessaloniki will be important for this issue and we , the Greek Presidency , want it to be a success .
We are an area with 25 Member States .
We are a Europe which is now discussing new policies , such as the so-called Wider Europe New Neighbourhood policy , the issues of the Balkans , of the Mediterranean , of the Middle East , the issues of economic intergovernmentalism and immigration .
.
On the contrary , it takes them as given and is merely interested in moderating the consequences , in slowing down the rate at which they emerge and in 'countering ' the losses .
This is the direction being taken by the funding measures to scrap small and medium-sized fishing vessels in order to wipe out small and medium-sized fishermen and further reinforce the fishing capabilities of large vessels .
.
.
These final arrangements , however , appear to be the result of political reaction in the heat of the moment to the shipwreck of the Prestige .
More specifically , Greek shipping is being hard hit , harming the workers in the shipping industry .
A real safety policy needs to combat the unaccountability of shipowners , apply substantive measures against infringements of the law , adjust operating positions to today 's enhanced requirements and help improve crews ' living and working conditions by safeguarding their rights and giving their trades union the power to intervene decisively .
One example is that the ship repair industry in Greece , a country with one of the biggest fleets in the world , has almost been wiped out .
As you know , Turkey is an important partner of the Union , with which we have maintained contractual relations for a very long time .
