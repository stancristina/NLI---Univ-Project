This is why this debate is important .
Just as we are now preparing to ratify the European Constitution , we must not forget Europe’s remarkable achievements : half a century of peace and of social and economic development , as well as the recent enlargement representing the reunification of our continent .
In these circumstances , for Europe to remain an area that lives up to the winning model , we must wholeheartedly accept the inevitability of carrying out reforms that will first and foremost enhance our competitiveness .
The European Union has to be the Europe of freedom , and freedom only exists in a healthy economic environment , where there is real and effective security .
Not the security of talk that exploits people’s fears or that ignores the threats , but the kind resulting from firm policies that guarantee effective borders and internal security .
I thank you for your contributions , which reflect a wide variety of views in this Parliament .
Thirdly , I also see that there is broad consensus on the need for a proactive cohesion policy , a true solidarity policy in Europe .
The increasing age of our population , the effects of globalisation – all this requires Europe to adapt and change within this more competitive context .
Accordingly , we have to identify the highest common denominator for a dynamic consensus .
That is why I say that now , when I see the issue of European identity being debated so often in Europe , I have to stress that it is rooted in respect for our various national , regional and local identities .
We are looking after our interests with a more ambitious neighbourhood policy : a policy for our Eastern or Mediterranean neighbours that promotes stability and peace , as we have been doing in Ukraine , for example .
As I have already said , Europe cannot be selfish .
Since it has been concluded that the main target of policy reform in the new financial period should be rural development , it must also be underlined that more than half of the EU-25 population lives in rural areas , which cover 90 % of our territory .
I think this consultation is essential in view of the importance of the ERDF in correcting regional imbalances .
The Committee of the Regions ought to be consulted in view of the importance of the powers exercised by bodies with local and regional power in their capacity as public authorities .
The accession of these new Member States in fact requires a series of legal adaptations so as to place them on an equal footing in the customs , economic and competition fields .
That means the continuation of a policy whereby support for rural development is used as part of a strategy to contain common agricultural policy costs , to liberalise agricultural markets and to negotiate with the World Trade Organisation .
At the same time , it stipulated that the dairy premium should be paid out by the Austrian authorities within the limit of their national reference quantity and their budgetary ceiling .
Even during the currency of the present financial perspective , the instruments in question ( PHARE , ISPA , SAPARD ) will be able to contribute to structural improvements in administrative , legal and environmental terms and in the agricultural and transport sectors , preparing Croatia to adopt the unified Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance ( IPA ) , which will be made available to it from 2007 .     .
I , personally , fully endorse the proposal before us , which , as far as we are concerned , should have been implemented long ago .
Codification is laudable work and absolutely necessary .
I voted in favour of the proposal before us aimed at codifying Decision 73/391/EEC and subsequent amendments and additions thereto , on consultation and information procedures in matters of credit insurance , credit guarantees and financial credits .
There have been many directives regulating the minimum level of crude oil and/or petroleum products .
The proposal seeks to reshape the nature of the relationship between the EU and third countries that are party to agreements concluded on the above-mentioned sea areas , following the recent accession to the EU of Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania and Poland .
I support the rapporteur in that I welcome this proposal and , at the same time , I understand the concerns that the objectives of protecting ...     .
On the proposal for a Council decision granting a Community guarantee to the European Investment Bank against losses under loans for certain types of projects in Russia and the Western New Independent States ( WNIS ) .
The issue before us is the third readmission agreement between the European Community and a third country , which forms part of the so-called ‘fight against illegal immigration’ .
They are also concerned with safeguarding respect for human rights , given that we must remain vigilant to ensure that the law is being strictly complied with .
The Commission did not manage to obtain a unanimous decision in the Council on its proposal for a directive on simplifying and streamlining reduced VAT rates .
We hope that the new Member States will make their contribution towards achieving this aim .     .
On the proposal for a Council regulation concerning Community financial contributions to the International Fund for Ireland ( 2005-2006 ) .
Against this backdrop , the promotion of peace through economic and social development in the regions of both parts of Ireland takes on extra significance .
The case before us concerns the judicial process relating to behaviour that bears no relation to political activity .
Hence our vote in favour , albeit with criticisms of the attempts to contaminate apparently positive aims .     .
I should also like to underline the need to
