that we are seeing in European defence budgets , most notably by Germany , demonstrate resolve to make a greater contribution to Western defence efforts .
The amendments we have put forward to the Lalumi√®re resolution are intended to stress the importance of the continued commitment of our North American allies to the security of Europe as a foremost priority , to make it clear that the European Union should only opt to act militarily in agreement with the alliance and when NATO as a whole has chosen not to be engaged , to insist that any rapid reaction force should also be assigned to NATO and in any case should not impact adversely on the capacity of NATO allies to meet their alliance obligations .
We want EU decisions relating to the use of military assets , including decisions taken on the basis of a common strategy or when implementing a joint action , to be taken unanimously .
There should not be attempts to create a European armed police force behind the cloak of the common European security and defence policy .
The Royal Ulster Constabulary is a fine force with a proud record in fighting terrorism but this is not at all relevant to this particular debate .
Our overall concern is that the common European security and defence policy is indeed a further step towards European political integration and that is our fundamental objection .
Madam President , outside the door of this Chamber there is somebody dressed as a cigarette packet .
I have no objections to people dressing as cigarette packets but I have objections to what I take to be political manifestations outside the very door to the Hemicycle .
Is this allowed under our Rules ?
.
The current practice of moving Parliament between Brussels and Strasbourg implies high costs for the European taxpayer , and reduces the effectiveness of parliamentary work .
It undermines Parliament 's credibility and political impact .
The solution to this problem would be to concentrate Parliament 's work at only one place .
We call upon the Member States to consider a change of the Treaty , allowing the European Parliament to decide upon its own seat .
In order to make this point we have voted for all amendments that aim to reduce the amount of time spent in Strasbourg and increase that in Brussels .
.
I have not missed one day in any of the Parliamentary sessions since the election and , I believe , only two in the previous Parliament .
It is therefore with some hesitation that I voted for the deletion of Fridays from the Strasbourg sessions .
I have come to the opinion that agendas for the Friday sessions have been engineered to fill up the session and are becoming increasingly meaningless .
It does this institution no favours when , on a Friday , there are fewer than a hundred Members debating a resolution which is of no importance .
This Parliament must restructure its mode of operation to reflect the changed working conditions .
Mr President , I voted against Amendment No 54 which would have allowed a derogation from our yield limits on cigarettes exported to third countries .
All cigarettes are harmful .
None do any good .
Smoking is an addiction , indeed a slow suicide , as we have voted , and manufacturers have admitted and known for some time that it causes cancer and other diseases .
I agree that third countries should set their own health rules but we should not approve of double standards .
If we choose tight protection for our citizens we should not allow the exporting of more dangerous products which profit from the addiction of others .
No man is an island .
All human beings are involved with each other .
I cannot condone profiting from the ill-health of third world citizens .
.
EPLP Members fully support the main direction of the Maaten Report in highlighting health risks associated with tobacco .
However , we believe that there are a number of technical areas which will need to be clarified following first reading in negotiation with the Commission and Council .
The question of tobacco growing subsidy has not been addressed in this report .
Although many Members feel it is part of the whole debate on tobacco and health and should have been included here , we believe that it would be more correctly brought up in reform of the CAP.
.
I wholeheartedly support amendments to the Commission 's revised proposal on tobacco that will strengthen health warnings on cigarette packets in the EU.
The new cigarette health warnings will cover half the surface of cigarette packs , with warnings 40 % of the packet size on the front and 50 % on the back .
Smoking kills and there is no nice way to put that .
Half of all long-term smokers will eventually be killed by tobacco and of these , half will die during middle age losing 20 to 25 years of life .
As many as half a million people in Europe are killed by tobacco , and 85 % of lung cancers are caused by smoking .
Madam President , I would have welcomed the radical proposal to use pictures to illustrate the damage which smoking does to health , like they do in Canada .
If shocking pictures of smoke-filled lungs or rotting teeth show the harmful effects of smoking , go ahead and print them on packs .
I am disappointed it was not accepted .
It is preposterous that tobacco companies are trying to destroy this legislation .
I am fed up with them trying to put a stop to these proposals .
They have misled people for far too long .
At present , warnings are cleverly hidden by displays or coloured packaging .
Smokers or those considering smoking must know the full risks of their choice .
