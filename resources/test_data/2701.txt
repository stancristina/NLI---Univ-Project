The issue is the implementation of fundamental rights in Europe and action against terrorism .
With reference to the interim report under discussion , I would nevertheless like to emphasise that the Treaties do not bestow competence on the European Union in such matters as these , and national intelligence is not within the scope of application of the Treaty , because the Member States have unanimously decided to reserve the task of monitoring the work of national intelligence services for themselves .
On 21 November the European Union Foreign Affairs Ministers discussed this information at a session of the General Affairs and External Affairs Council .
The European Union Foreign Affairs Ministers and Secretary of State Rice discussed the matter again later on during the latter’s visit to Brussels .
Since early this year there has been intensive dialogue with the United States at various levels and in different assemblies regarding these matters .
There have also been discussions on the need for compliance with international law in the fight against terrorism .
EU Foreign Affairs Ministers have stated that the European Union is still seriously concerned about Guantanamo Bay , and the topic has been discussed with the United States on more than one occasion .
As the country to hold the Presidency of the Council , Finland will naturally continue to keep alive the debate on human rights in dialogue with the United States .
The EU must work on the basis that terrorism is to be opposed through legitimate means and in a way that respects both international and national law .
Finally , I would like to quote my favourite American writer , Thomas L. Friedman , from his book ‘The World is Flat’ : The world is flat .
One of the most dangerous things that has happened to America since 9/11 under the Bush administration is that the United States has gone from exporting hope to exporting fear .
As all of us in this House know , the Council does not have the means to investigate actions which are contrary to applicable law in this case .
The Council assumes that current cooperation between private companies like SWIFT and the US authorities will be in accordance with applicable law and in compliance with fundamental rights .
When this regulation has been passed , it will apply to transfers of funds in any currency sent or received by anyone offering payment services based within the Community .
Article 14 of the proposed regulation states that anyone providing payment services must respond immediately and thoroughly to requests made by the authorities responsible for the prevention of money laundering or the financing of terrorism in the Member State in which they are located and which concern data to be disclosed on the payer accompanying transfers of funds and storing this information .
At the same time , the regulation will prevent all types of illegal action targeted at the Community financing system .
The regulation is to be adopted by means of the codecision procedure .
We will be closely monitoring the legislative work to prevent , , illegal and unjustified activity against the financing system .
The framework decision aims to ensure that personal data on European citizens has a high level of protection .
That requires common regulations , so that we can determine the legality and quality of data being processed by the competent authorities in the Member States .
The proposal is being discussed by the competent bodies within the Council .
The Presidency takes a very serious view of this , and , as has been said , it is the responsibility of the National Bank of Belgium to oversee SWIFT and we also now await with interest what the Belgian authorities uncover .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as Prime Minister Vanhanen said here today , the Finnish Presidency believes that it is a very important objective to make the European Union an area of freedom , security and justice .
In addition to this , the Commission has issued a communication which contains proposals regarding both the content of the policies on justice and home affairs and an improved decision-making procedure .
As the President of the Commission has said , the Commission is ready to make proposals with the purpose of making use of the options in the Treaties to adjust the decision-making procedure .
This was to work closely with the Commission to examine the possibilities of improving decision-making and action in the domain of freedom , security and justice on the basis of the current Treaties .
Mr President , we will now aim to put our energies into this , because the time for close cooperation in policing and legal matters is clearly close at hand .
As the person who asked the question says , the eleventh conference of the parties to the United Nations Framework Agreement on Climate Change and the first meeting of the Parties serving as the Conference of Parties to the Kyoto Protocol resulted in two new processes for the future .
The first workshop held for the Convention dialogue gave all parties the opportunity to present their ideas on advancing development goals in a sustainable way by addressing action on adjustment and realising the full potential of technology and market-based opportunities .
This was the first of four workshops and , at the same time , the start of a longer process , which it is intended to bring to a conclusion at the end of next year .
The workshop leaders , Howard Bamsey of Australia and Sandia de Wet of South Africa , reported to COP12 on the workshop and have promised that the report will be available by August 2006 .
The second session of the working group will be during the second session of the Parties serving as the Conference of Parties to the Kyoto Protocol , with further development of the working group
