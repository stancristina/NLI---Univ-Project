of course , that the data is both of a biological and economic nature and the information to be provided from the various Member States must be standardised across the Community and , as stated by the rapporteur in her report , must be in compliance with international provisions .
I welcome the availability of funding for national programmes , even taking into consideration provisions concerning the minimum programmes to be met .
I agree with the proposals that information provided to international organisations should also be made available to the Commission .
Otherwise the purpose of collecting and collating data would be defeated and if the information is not available then the precautionary approach would continue .
Sound , factual information is in the best interests of the industry .
I believe that the streamlined information to be made available will be of major benefit and importance to the decision makers and to their advisers and will go some way to ensure a more sustainable fishery that will continue to provide jobs in parts of the Union where there is no alternative source of employment .
I am pleased to confirm that in my country they are working to ensure that the detailed practicalities , the logistics and utilisation of information are developed in the best interests of the resource of the industry and decision makers and our Group has no difficulty in supporting these reports .
The Northern Ireland fishing industry has received many hard blows from this Union .
They have seen their own waters plundered by others while they have had to put up their own boats and desist from fishing .
The recent decisions on the cod quota for the Irish Sea is yet another hard blow which could well prove to be a mortal blow to the Northern Ireland fishing industry .
I see the Commissioner smiling but I speak with the authority of all the political parties in Northern Ireland , a diverse crowd but all agreed on this one issue .
The European Union needs to recognise that when such drastic decisions are taken against conflicting scientific evidence submitted by the fishermen themselves , which have been totally rejected out of hand , for the conservation of their own fish stocks , then serious trouble can only result when these men are not heard .
At a recent visit in Brussels these fishermen' s representatives , duly accredited , travelled from Northern Ireland and they were threatened with expulsion from the meeting when they sought to argue a case that they had very well prepared .
That is scandalous , their case ought to be heard .
It should be put on record , and I want to put it on record today .
I sat in the meeting where the scientists told us that haddock would soon be extinct in the Irish Sea and at that very time haddock had a special , spectacular increase of breeding in the Irish Sea so the scientists can be wrong .
As I have said all the Northern Ireland parties are united on this issue and those responsible for this cod quota regulation should reconsider this decision which can only spell not conservation for the fish but ruination to Northern Ireland fisheries which will affect all the fisheries of this Union .
Infectious salmon anaemia is a contagious viral disease which was first recorded in Norway in 1984 , then in Canada in 1986 and first found in European Union territory in May 1998 in Scotland .
Although the virus has been found in other species , the disease itself is so far confined to salmon .
The virus is known not to survive above 25o Celsius and scientists have therefore agreed that no threat to human health exists ; it simply cannot survive in warm-blooded creatures .
The Scottish salmon-farming industry is the biggest in the EU , spread throughout some of Europe ' s most peripheral communities .
It sustains some 6 500 jobs and generates around EUR 800 million annually .
It is obvious therefore that this issue is especially important to Scotland but it is vitally important to all parts of Europe that the disease be brought under control and , if possible , eradicated .
The current directive prohibits the use of vaccination and requires that all fish in an affected farm be slaughtered whether affected by the disease or not .
The intention in adopting the current regime was to eradicate ISA and to do so as quickly as possible .
The reality is that the compulsory slaughter policy has failed even to contain , let alone eradicate ISA , and while failing to deliver its objectives , the present rule has had a devastating economic effect on the industry with no compensation being paid and no possibility of commercial insurance .
The proposed changes are twofold : the first would permit the use of vaccination as a weapon in this battle .
This is a necessary change and should be accompanied by a commitment at European level to instigate and fund research into developing an effective vaccine .
The second proposed change would permit a phased withdrawal of fish from affected farms , working to a plan based on the severity of the problem in any particular farm .
This approach has been used very effectively in Norway where new reports of ISA are down to a handful of cases a year having peaked at some 80-90 cases per year in the early 1990s .
I therefore support the Commission ' s proposed changes and I am calling for their urgent adoption and implementation .
I also highlight the issue of compensation and call for the amendment of Council Decision 90/424/EEC by specifically including ISA in its appended list of diseases , thereby enabling compensation to be paid at 50 % Commission , 50 % Member State .
