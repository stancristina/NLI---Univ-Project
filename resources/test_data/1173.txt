Frequent interaction between immigrants and Member State citizens is a fundamental mechanism for integration .
The common basic principles are based on the conclusions of the Council set forth in December 2005 , which took account of the Commission Communication entitled ‘A Common Agenda for Integration : Framework for the Integration of Third-Country Nationals in the European Union’ .
In these contexts the emphasis is on the need for members of the host society to become involved in creating opportunities for the participation of immigrants in European societies in various ways .
Mr President , it is in the Council’s interests in general also to support the more proactive involvement of civil society in the integration of immigrants , because there is a desire to promote the transparency of EU administration in relation to the public .
In addition , the debate on other legislative plans will be made open .
It will hopefully be one channel via which the people can be encouraged to find out about the criteria for decision-making and have an influence between elections as well .     .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Member States have the right to adopt their own taxation systems within the limits of Community law .
The working group set up to consider the practical aspects of the code makes an assessment on the basis of the criteria set out in the code of conduct whether taxation measures adopted by one Member State constitutes harmful competition or not .
In addition to this , there are intensive technical preparations under way right now in the Commission relating to the proposal for a common , consolidated , corporation tax base .
Mr President , the purpose of this common , consolidated , corporate tax base initiative is to create a corporate tax base that would be simple .
The initiative does not go into the issue of tax rates , but a tax base .
It is not the Finnish Presidency’s intention to discuss this in the Council : the purpose is to hear how the technical wok is progressing .     .
Taxation is , as I stated in my original answer , an important matter both for the functioning of the internal market and competition .
In a statement which the President of the ECOFIN Council gave at the spring meeting of the IMF’s International Monetary and Financial Committee , he reiterated the Council’s position on global imbalances , saying that in the medium term the enormous current account imbalances cannot be sustained and it is the combined responsibility of all the major players involved to address the problem .
There are also possible macroeconomic risks that stem from protectionist measures and unilateral action .
An open , multilateral system of trade is an essential prerequisite for greater continued growth .
The communiqué in April 2006 of the International Monetary and Financial Committee echoed this view , which partners at global level generally accepted .     .
Mr President , perhaps it is not my strongest area , and nor does it fall within the competence of the Council , to speculate on future oil prices , but of course the present situation with regard to supply and demand and the direction in which it seems to be headed do not support the hypothesis that prices will quickly drop to a very low level here .     .
With regard to reviewing the procedures , I would like to state that Finland , during its Presidency , wants to return to the practice where questions are answered in the order in which they have come to the attention of the Council , and the Presidency does not , therefore , intend to answer them by subject matter .
It will also be the task of the Presidency to submit to the European Parliament written replies to questions which are not dealt with during Question Time owing to a lack of time .
There are a lot of these this week .
At the end of the Presidency you will have been here several times and obtained more experience – you have done very well during your first Question Time – would you be willing to give your practical recommendations to the Council concerning Question Time ?
Some people will even watch this on the Internet or on Euronews .
Would you be willing to do that for us in Question Time ?     .
We must remember , however , that this issue is crucial to the control of the Union’s external borders .
I quite understand that the European Union’s policy on visas is seen as awkward in the Western Balkans , and even as a factor that is hampering rapprochement with the Union .
It is obvious that , for example , the mobility of youth and students needs to be facilitated .
The EU has nominated the countries of the Western Balkans as possible candidate countries .
That will require the Western Balkan countries to introduce significant administrative reforms in , for example , greater security of documentation and the fight against organised crime and corruption .
In January 2006 the Commission issued a communication on the Western Balkans in which it set out a large number of proposals also to make the visa regime easier in accordance with the Hague Programme .
The Council is committed to the implementation of the proposals on the Thessaloniki agenda , and has also stated that it supports the Commission ’s proposals .
This will make it easier for border residents to cross the external borders of the EU.
Special action would be taken , for example , to promote researcher and student exchanges and facilitate the movement of other separately identifiable groups .
This way the Union will also benefit from the arrangement because the countries in the Western
