the situation where the relevant market definition was maybe too narrow .
Mr President , the dispute in connection with Mr Nisticò ' s excellent report regarding the remuneration of blood donors is important in terms of its multidimensional , ethical and practical aspects , and a lot more serious than might be inferred from the debate .
Various patient groups and authorities have appealed to us here in Parliament not to allow blood donation to become commercialised .
The importance of tests has been emphasised here , and that is good .
But with HIV tests , for example , there is a certain window period , as it is known , when the virus still does not show up .
I want to stress that we also have a responsibility for how the rest of the world might imitate our practices .
We already know of a case in China where an absolute catastrophe related to blood quality occurred when blood donors were paid what were for them vast sums of money .
Thirdly , there is the risk of being guilty of inconsistency .
It is nevertheless intellectually dishonest to open up this whole area to market forces just because there is a shortage of plasma .
Amendment No 17 , however , makes adequate guarantees regarding the possibility of reimbursing costs incurred in donating plasma including travel expenses , and of offering compensation for lost working time .
It would allow exceptions to be made in cases where the plasma shortage really is an insurmountable problem .
However , I would like to say that the Committee on Petitions may even be the very committee in this Chamber that is able to find solutions to the gaping chasm that exists between the people and the decision-makers .
This deserves our enthusiastic support as this may just be one way - as Mr Bösch and the Committee state - to reinforce and broaden the scope of the right of petition instrument .
It is quite clear that the Commission should now be promoting this swiftly and determinedly .
Mr Duff has already referred to Teresa Almeida Garrett ' s report on the Statute of the European Ombudsman , and I have to say his arguments convince me that it should be possible that members of the institutions can also if necessary be heard by the Ombudsman when it is a matter of administrative error .
I hope Mr Duff ' s amendment will be widely supported .
Madam President , President of the Commission and the Council , the world today seems much bleaker than it did before Tuesday ' s shocking events .
On behalf of the Greens/European Free Alliance Group , I want to express the deep sorrow we feel for the victims who died in this tragedy and wish to send my heartfelt condolences to the families and all those who have lost their loved ones .
As soon as the terrorists are identified , they should be brought to an international court for crimes against humanity and judged accordingly .
This is the time to speed up the establishment of a permanent international criminal court .
If , on the other hand , the United States responds with attacks on possible suspect countries , they will not only be killing more innocent people , just like those who died so tragically on Tuesday , but they will also be encouraging further counter-attacks : two wrongs never make a right .
I would like to express our deep concern about the situation in the Middle East and call for international efforts to bring the peace negotiations back on track to be intensified .
We need a political response on a global scale to this unprecedented challenge in order to weed out the real roots of terrorism which stem from political , social and environmental conflicts : this concept underlies the report of Mr Watson , which this Parliament adopted last week .
That is why we believe a European Union/ United States Summit should be held to deal with all aspects of the new terrorist threats , including the social and political causes .
On Tuesday , our sense of security was shown to be illusory .
What has happened in New York and Washington cannot be allowed to ever happen again .
Mr President , the debate on the future of the cohesion policy is a very timely one .
My concern is not just how regional policy can be made to work effectively both in the present Member States and in the countries that have applied for membership but also the continuation of structural policy in the present Member States in the next Structural Funds period .
How can we become more effective , achieve better results and reduce bureaucracy ?
In this connection I would also like to enquire what the Commission ' s position is regarding what enlargement means for the overall funding of structural policy .
At the same time I would also like to communicate to the Commission that a funding model for enlargement is not acceptable where those having to pay would be the poor regions of the existing EU countries , where there are still lasting problems owing to difficult natural conditions , long distances or sparse populations .
Mr President , Valenciano Martínez-Orozco ' s excellent report clearly states that female genital mutilation is a crime , about which Europe must not remain silent .
The rights of women , young girls or baby girls are being trampled on in the name of various cultural traditions or even the assumed dictates of religion .
Regrettably , female genital mutilation has been found to have taken place and to be taking place in immigrant communities in the EU also , although this practice is prohibited in the criminal legislation of Member States and it is clearly in breach of the principles of the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights
