.
We must then adopt a modern law on public administration and openness .
All employees should know that future promotion is a question of effort , not of friendships and contacts .
Anyone who occupies a managerial position must be more capable than those beneath him .
The Commission should be decentralised , so that the staff are given responsibility and authority to live up to .
Let us put an end to complicated procedures where a decision has to be endorsed twenty times and it is impossible afterwards to say who is really responsible .
Privileges can be phased out .
It will not be popular , but who is going to defend the fact that the first consequence of moving a task to Brussels is that those who are going to carry it out will receive a trebled salary , diplomatic status with freedom from prosecution , access to business lunches and duty-free spirits ?
The salaries of Commissioners should also be reduced before appointments are made .
A Commissioner should be paid the same as a minister in the country he represents , and should pay tax so that at least in that respect he loses his status as an expatriate eurocrat .
It should be possible for Parliament to inspect the travel and entertainment budget .
We must at last have a reform that produces openness , whereby documents in the Commission will at least also be available to Parliament as soon as the Commission has delivered them to a committee , an undertaking , a country , a journalist or another external party .
Like every modern business , the Union must focus on what it can do better than others , or in other words leave alone tasks which others can do better or more cheaply , concentrate on cross-border cooperation and allow other matters to return to the Member States .
We would rather unite Europe in a Europe of the democracies .
Mr Prodi , you are the second President of the Commission I will be involved in selecting .
I must admit that after the first two meetings we had together , I was not entirely happy , but now I can say that I was very pleased with the speech you gave here in Parliament today .
I am glad that the environment , consumers and employment were included in your speech .
I am glad that you stress the fact that it can be beneficial to cooperate .
I agree , Mr Prodi , that we should strengthen the role of the Commission within the WTO , but I would warn against jeopardising the social dimension and against holding consumers and the environment to ransom .
The other thing I would like to mention today is your task of reforming the Commission 's work and working methods - the new business culture .
I hope that the institutions , in other words the Council , Parliament and the Commission , can cooperate on this in future .
I did not receive an answer to my question .
Mr President , 1 May was the day on which the Amsterdam Treaty and the common foreign and security policy became a reality .
It is my belief that if we had had this foreign policy in place several years ago , we would not have experienced the crises in Bosnia and Croatia - far less the war in Serbia .
The prevention of crises is , as our colleagues have mentioned , extremely important .
So I say : crisis prevention first , military hardware second .
The new institution , ' Mr or Mrs Foreign Policy , ' should be primarily preventative and cooperate with the OSCE , the UN and so on .
The secretaries-general will now meet tomorrow morning to organise the voting .
A common statute turns us into the EU 's representatives in the Member States instead of the countries ' representatives in the EU.
If we nonetheless feel able to vote for the Council 's proposal , it is because in practice a majority of those here in Parliament want to continue claiming EUR 1 000 for a journey costing EUR 400 , for example , and we give higher priority to cleaning up travel payments than to our objection in principle to common salaries and conditions of employment , and here we would particularly emphasise the fact there will be the possibility of taxing EU salaries nationally .
In the circumstances , the proposal which the Council has arrived at is a good one , and we recommend the Council to reach corresponding rules for the appointment of the new Commission and new civil servants in the institutions .
The counter-argument that there should be equal pay for equal work is not feasible when it comes to international cooperation .
Equal pay is a nice principle , but the countries are not yet the same , and at the moment it is more important to get rid of Parliament 's wastefulness .
Mr President , I would like to say to both the rapporteur and the Council of Ministers : settle your differences now , and stop being so self-important !
Either we adopt a modified version of the Council 's proposal or we will still be squabbling about this in five years ' time .
It would destroy Parliament 's reputation and spoil the pleasure of our work .
Now try to be a bit constructive !
The proposal which the Council of Ministers put forward was far too concerned with wanting to 'make it better '.
We Liberals are able to accept the Council 's proposal , but we are proposing some modifications so that we can achieve majority support for it here in Parliament .
If it still goes wrong , the voters will have to give their verdict in June .
