signs , but also signs that indicate that there are difficult roads ahead .
In addition , I would like Serbia to realise at last that the Serbs in Kosovo do not want to be encouraged not to take part in the government .
One person got a suspended sentence of one and a half years .
In a compromise with the Council - this went through all the bodies - the Directive pushed through the open declaration , which meant that labels had to state the ingredients with a ± 15 % tolerance , and the exact composition had to be provided on request .
I hope - as Mr Nicholson said - that both the feed industry and farmers will understand that there is something to be defended here , that a community is being formed against these attempts to dispose of toxic substances via feed .
We must be careful to avoid contradiction here .
The German ambassador , who spoke at his funeral , was described by the President as someone who should leave the country .
The Tokyo group , consisting of Japan , the United States , Norway and the European Union , has called on the LTTE leadership to negotiate the details of a cease-fire with the Sri Lankan Government at long last .
We are thus against deferral .
What about the Western-oriented majority ?
It is progress in itself that there are people in the Arab League , in the Arab camp , who are prepared to have that debate .
We have adopted a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the intra-Community transfer of defence equipment and on tendering in the field of security and defence .
This is a first , very clear demand from this Parliament .
On that basis , the progress made is really quite great , from a historical point of view .
You have just told us that European cooperation must be strengthened at the strategic level .
Otherwise , what will happen is that , in a few months time , the US administration will be more forward looking than us in the European Union and will decide , in bilateral talks with Russia , on crucial security strategy positions without European power - political power , conflict-prevention power - being able to have any influence on this re-stabilisation of transatlantic security policy .
The report labels NATO as 'the core of European security ' .
Therefore , I do support these two concepts , but not for the security policy .
One objective is the creation of a free trade area by 2010 , but this , too , has ground to a halt .
This instrument gives the European Union the opportunity to play an active role in its neighbouring region , in order to take forward democratic reform and sustainable development .
We are talking here not only about research carried out at universities - academic research - or in industry but also , in particular , about research carried out in small and medium-sized enterprises .
Follow-up of the energy efficiency national action plans : a first assessment ( short presentation ) on behalf of the GUE/NGL-NGL Group . - ( DE ) Madam President , Commissioner Kovács , ladies and gentlemen , and especially Mrs van den Burg , it is regrettable that here in Parliament we are only able to agree on the Commission 's proposal and not on the actual report produced by Mrs van den Burg .
This will avoid the less than ideal situation of us having to extend the reduced tax rates every couple of years .
We have a similar situation in this House .
For reasons that never made sense to me , the idea of the European private company was then erased , so to speak , from the action plan over the years , in the course of this Commission 's term of office , and was not pursued further by the Commission at that time .
The story is similar to that of the European company .
Madam President , Commissioner , I should like to make four comments .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the principle of effective internal control is one of the most important budgetary principles that the Commission must observe when implementing the budget and utilising the funds .
Oil will clearly remain a very important source of primary energy in the EU even in the medium and long term .
I think that we , as Parliament , as a European body , have together taken an important step forwards that has not , so far , really managed to demonstrate its importance to the general public or in the political debate .
This regulation will make European cars safer .
This single regulation will rescind 50 existing directives and , wherever possible , replace them by international rules .
Tyres ' rolling resistance , depending on the driving conditions and speed , accounts for 20 to 30 % of fuel consumption .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , at this point , I can but offer my sincere thanks for the broad support for this proposal from all sides of the House .
That is something that we could certainly discuss at the beginning of a parliamentary term and then stick to for that entire term , but there should be no criticism that processes are democratically unsound at the end of a term - the time when particular issues are being resolved - after three years of participation in such a process here in Parliament .
In order to obtain a permit , they must be better than the specification from the safety network .
That distorts competition and damages the environment and I am therefore arguing for a new approach for the improved implementation of best available techniques
