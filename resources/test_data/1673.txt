be aware , in addition to the damage in the Balkans , of the devastation wreaked by the war both on international order , with international legislation ripped to shreds and on the UN , which has been razed to the ground , and to bear in mind the substantial loss of autonomy for Europe with regard to the Atlantic Alliance and the United States of America .
Now , of course we must reconstruct the Balkans , but in order to do so , Europe needs to regain its autonomy and authority , which requires democratic construction as well .
It is not for me to remind you that there are twenty million unemployed in Europe at the moment - and unemployment is a problem which undermines Europe 's social cohesion - and that the achievements of this Europe in areas such as the welfare state are being undermined by neo-free trade policies , which are those same neo-free trade policies in which you exalted the need for flexibility in previous speeches and which , however , brought a reduction in the quality of work and life , in contrast to your proposals for the future .
There is a need for flexibility , not in the labour market , but regarding the Stability Pact .
Mr President , you went so far as to announce an era of change , a revolution - in which I wish you every success - and mentioned an internal restructuring which maybe Mr Kinnock will elaborate upon ; the fifth , I may add , in seven years !
Faith will be regained , therefore , when there is greater transparency , but especially when greater consideration is given to national and cultural differences when Directives are issued and there is greater and more frequent recourse to the principle of subsidiarity .
Applause
I am sure that you and your team - and I would like to draw attention to the balance achieved in your team - are starting off in the most favourable conditions for the successful completion of this operation .
We must do all that we can , and become all that we can as Europeans , taking Kosovo as a starting point , with the obligations which fall to us to set reconstruction in motion , to bring to life a policy of peace and stability for the whole of the Balkans and to bring about a Federal Republic of Yugoslavia which is democratic and multi-ethnic .
We are at a delicate stage : practically all Member States are going to have to face national reform of the welfare state .
I was then proved right as he lost the vote of confidence of the Italian Parliament .
The first is that we agree with your objective of accelerating economic union by means of a political Europe .
Without a European strategy from this point of view , we will run the risk that an economy such as ours will tend to concentrate its resources on the strongest areas and leave the weakest by the wayside , even though some of these have recently shown signs of great progress .
I say open confidence because all those who spoke , even those who criticised the composition of the Commission , acknowledged the need to work closely together in a major , intense undertaking and recognised the fact that the future of the European Union lies in collaboration between the Parliament and the Commission .
Applause It is important for us to take the donkey as the symbol of our politics because , in this five-year term , we must try to do likewise .
Please consider the fact that we have arrived here with a Commission which will work hard - well or not so well , we will see - whatever the case , which is able to agree on common programmes and the Members of which are ready to face their responsibilities , individually and collectively .
I reiterate this point because there has been a great deal of discussion regarding the manner in which we will conduct the audiences , hearings and inquiries .
Please assess it in this way .
The Wise Men 's report is a wonderful instrument , and we must read it and reflect upon it , but the decision is ours alone to make and its consequences ours to bear , and it is in this sense that the dialogue between Parliament and the Commission takes on a completely different dimension .
In fact , Manzoni says : 'Adelante , Pedro , si puedes ' , that is ' Go on , Pedro , if you ca n' , and this power to move forward is in your hands .
The guns may well have fallen silent , Mr President , but the anti-personnel mines continue their butchery ; the horror of war is over but not the horror of the discovery of mass graves day after day , a tragic , heart-rending testimony to a contempt for the right to live of individuals and populations , a right which is no less than respect for the diversity and identity of a people for whose affirmation we will fight both here and in our national parliaments .
It is true that the war has left deep wounds : they are clearly visible .
Kosovo must be reconstructed with its present and past inhabitants - both Albanian and Serbian - as protagonists .
This is the crux of the Öçalan issue : the fact that laws still exist in too many national legal codes which punish as a crime the exercising of peoples ' rights to self-determination in its extreme form of secession , even when non-violent , democratic means are employed .
For the same reason , my group finds it incomprehensible that Commissioner Bangemann should choose precisely this moment to take an extremely dubious step in his career
