A serious question of credibility arises now , when political priorities are being set at European level and adequate funding is not then being safeguarded for them .
The drastically blinkered Council is addressing the budget as a lowest denominator for compromise rather than as a means of development , redistribution and solidarity and as a tool for implementing European policies .
We here in the European Parliament shall vote for the amendments which strengthen the Community budget and the policies which Europe and its peoples need today .
We need to project a new plan for Europe and to express the real political will to implement it .     – Mr President , I wish to make three brief political comments .
At the same time , however , there have been cuts to the authority of the leaders of Europe themselves , who got everyone 's expectations up and then capitulated unconditionally to the philosophy of austerity or , to be precise , to the philosophy of miserliness , not austerity , because austerity is when you cut the excess , when you cut the waste ; but when you cut back on investments in the future and in hope , that is not called austerity , it is called miserliness .
Instead of leading , we are bringing up the rear .
Nonetheless , the legal order of each Member State has an adequate and sufficiently strict legal arsenal for combating organised crime , which is a constituent element of the capitalist system and is bred by it .
The communists are and always have been opponents of the crime under common criminal law which is often connected to mechanisms of the urban state .
The objective is the definitive eradication of the disease in reared poultry and wild birds , species that carry and feed the pathogen .
The solution is to 'combat ' the ΕU of big business and war until it is exterminated .     – Mr President , I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council , Mr Alexander , two brief questions .
Firstly , knowing that a referendum will be held in Montenegro in 2006 on its possible secession from the joint state of Serbia-Montenegro , to what extent will progress in negotiations on the stabilisation agreement affect this referendum in Montenegro ?
Would he nonetheless permit me to remark that he has given me technical answers to a purely political question .
Thus one of the biggest bases of the United States of America has been constructed , threatening neighbouring countries .
We saw during the presidential elections in 2003 that there were serious irregularities .
The European Commission must be firm and clear in its message to the Azeris .
The Barcelona process deserves our special attention because it is the most integrated expression of the European Union 's foreign policy , in that it is a multilateral , global partnership expressed through an integrated strategy .
There has been a lack of perspicacity , political will , adequate financing and an inability on the part of the partners to promote reforms and cooperation between each other so that they become attractive markets and economies .
They have not become aware of the challenges which require us to live together or of our points in common or even of the substance of our differences .
The role of the Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference is very important and has already started to prove its worth and we hope that it will contribute to this mutual understanding and forging of a common conscience .
What we are calling for is more than just education and jobs .
The impasse in the peace process in the Middle East and the Palestinian question continue to have a determining and negative influence on Euro-Mediterranean cooperation .
The question is how the Barcelona process will proceed in coming years .
How will they operate without adequate financing ?
My sincere thanks also to the Committee on Petitions , Mr Libicki , all my colleagues here today , Sir Robert Atkins and everyone else who helped with this report .
Commissioner , Mr Diamandouros , ladies and gentlemen , the Ombudsman is an independent institution and a mechanism for controlling the administration of the European Union .
Although it was assumed that enlargement would be the main cause for the increase in complaints to the European Ombudsman , only 51 % of the increase was accounted for by the 10 new states .
However , despite Mr Diamandouros 's activity to inform the public , confusion continues to reign as regards the sectors of competence of the European Ombudsman .
In 2004 , 251 enquiries were closed , of which 4 were opened on his own initiative .
The conclusions of this meeting emphasise the genuine community of interests between the Commission and the European Ombudsman in ensuring that both the corrective and the interventionist aspect of the Ombudsman 's job are carried out successfully .
Bearing these statistics in mind , therefore , the Ombudsman should define the concept of maladministration with reference both to the institutions and bodies to which it applies and to matters which may be the subject of complaints .
The finding that 69 % of complaints were against the Commission is particularly interesting .
In addition , in this way we can see the material progress made within a year .
Tobacco farmers are in the firing line with cuts of EUR 1 billion .
Its purpose is to investigate complaints of maladministration by the institutions of the ΕU and by the governments of the Member States .
However , the institution has very little to do with the broad grass-roots classes , was not created to resolve their problems and is used to buffer dissatisfaction with the anti-grass roots policy itself and with the administrative means used to impose it .
