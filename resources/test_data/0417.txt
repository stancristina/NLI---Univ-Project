any decisions at all .
Mr Danielsson confirmed that the Eurogroup has started to take on additional functions and address more issues .
I am willing to admit to Mr Gahrton that , on taking over the presidency on 1 January this year , Sweden was quite concerned about how things would work with the Eurogroup and the Ecofin Council .
A great deal of respect has been shown for the principles set out in the decision I quoted from Luxembourg , i .e . the European Council Resolution of December 1997 .
As someone once said , it is difficult to predict , particularly about the future .
The Code of Conduct to which the honourable Member refers was drawn up on 8 June 1998 and is based on common criteria for conventional weapons transfers .
This annual review is presented in an annual report in accordance with Operative Provision No 8.
In line with this political aim , the Council is willing to contribute to the process and help to create a climate of trust between the parties concerned .
We will continue to work with our supporters in the Council to take further steps to increase transparency in the issues surrounding arms export .
As far as the Western Sahara conflict is concerned , it has gone on far too long .
This is the stance the Council will continue to take .
I can see from the report presented by Mr Baker in April this year that progress has actually been made in developing various proposals for self-governance for Western Sahara .
I cannot therefore comment on this .
I repeat that I believe it would be most unfortunate if the EU did not wholeheartedly support the collective , international efforts to solve this difficult conflict .
As I said , we have until June to try to achieve this .
Nor do we foresee any such harmonisation in the future .
The EU has now adopted new rules , a Regulation on the basis of Article 355 , which means that there is a more secure legal basis .
This is not new .
If we talk about the situation in Sweden , the fact that , in order to be able to make a correct assessment of damage , Swedish authorities may need to consult the institutions when applying the rules concerning foreign secrecy is not in itself anything new .
I want also , of course , to express my gratitude for the committed work that has been done to give the EU a new approach to the principle of public access to official records , in this case EU documents .
I nonetheless wish to ask a question .
I think the risk of self-censorship is very slight .
We have a requirement for rapid assessments to be made of whether or not documents can be released .
I do not know whether the Member is asking the President-in-Office of the Council to assess a practical matter .
The Council ' s position regarding the issue of Cyprus and the human rights situation in Turkey , including the issue of the Kurds , is well known .
In the light of the accession partnership and of Turkey ' s national programme for adopting the rules , the European Union will now concentrate on ensuring that Turkey really implements these priorities .
I note , as I have done on quite a few occasions before , that the partnership agreement with Turkey gives the European Union the opportunity to follow political developments in Turkey carefully .
That applies not only to the situation of the Kurdish minority but also , of course , to that of the Armenian population .
The Council noted the decisions on principle that have been taken to incorporate the appropriate tasks of the Western European Union into the Petersberg tasks .
The Swedish Presidency aims to have it adopted by the Council before the end of June .
A satellite centre is of the greatest importance for increasing early warning and crisis monitoring capability within the framework of the common foreign and security policy , especially the European security and defence policy .
The precise arrangements for this have not yet been determined .
That is to say , it lies outside the traditional budget .
The Council scarcely needs to remind you that the European Community and its Member States have played , and continue to play , a very active role in the international negotiations on climate change .
The European Council called upon all the negotiating partners to contribute constructively to reaching an agreement on the more specific conditions for implementing the Kyoto Protocol and facilitating a successful result .
The European Union has also made known its commitment to proceeding further with the preparations for ratification by no later than 2002 , even if the United States decides not to participate .
The EU emphasises that the climate issue is an important part of the transatlantic relationship and calls upon the United States to make a constructive contribution to this process .
This has happened in , for example , Germany , Sweden , Great Britain and Italy .
It may also be noted that , on 28 May , the Council and representatives of Member State governments will adopt a declaration concerning the fight against racism and xenophobia on the Internet .
Allow me also to conclude by saying that the Council really appreciates the European Parliament ' s commitment in this area .
The European Parliament ' s decision following the written declaration in remembrance of the Holocaust - a direct follow-up to Prime Minister Persson ' s initiative in arranging a conference in Stockholm on this subject in January 2000 - indicates that we should like to see the Member States establish national days of remembrance or , better still , a European Day of Remembrance
