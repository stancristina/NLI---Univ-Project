I now come to the second question , on the difference .
Even so , its rate is close to 2 % .
The coordination of fiscal and budgetary policies is working , and I think that so far , since the 2005 review , the Stability and Growth Pact and the budgetary coordination that is implicit in the implementation of the pact have worked very well .
Even within the euro area , however , there are divergences in current account deficits and the evolution of unit labour costs .
We need coordination on the basis of a clear , precise strategy , with explicit priorities and a single voice outside the euro area , and we need governance that consists of continuing to make the Euro Group work more effectively , along the lines of what we have been doing under Mr Juncker 's presidency since 1 January 2005 .
Vice-President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , the acronyms Frontex and Eurosur remind us of a harsh reality that we have to combat , which is that of thousands of people who continue to arrive in Europe illegally every day , fleeing from poverty and in search of a better future .
Now that the agency has taken its first positive steps , we must define its future role and its pace of development .
In addition , we call on the Commission to propose a review of its mandate in order to resolve the legal vacuum that hinders its action in maritime rescue and repatriation operations .
We must take steps to ensure that immigration stops being an obligation and becomes a right and a personal choice .
There are countries where the system of the European authentic act issued by a public official does not exist .
That is to say , if an act is merely probative in its country of origin , it cannot be considered an enforceable act .
The difficulty that the Commission can and will raise is the problem of the diversity of our legal systems , but I think this is a matter that we will have time to discuss at a later stage , once the Commission has submitted its proposal .
While I am on the French theme , I would also like to give a special mention to the judge and adviser to the Minister for Justice , Amélie Durand , and to my French colleagues who have played an active role , including Mr Gauzès and Mr Toubon .
We need to start finding solutions to these problems as soon as possible .
It should be remembered that under the Treaty establishing the European Community , the power to legislate lies in the European Commission .
In the field of electronic justice , for instance , we must not let ourselves get carried away with overenthusiasm for new technologies if they might jeopardise guarantees for citizens .
Although this Parliament is not very generous with time , because of its very nature , nevertheless in the period of almost an hour that we have devoted to the subject of justice we have had an opportunity to discuss some of the outstanding issues to some extent .
This raises the act to a level very similar to that of a judgment .
There is , therefore , no discrimination in this .
Nobody will therefore have failed to notice that I included my own country in the aspiration that it may shortly ratify and sign the Hague Convention .
I shall read it out very slowly in Spanish .
People who uphold human rights in Zimbabwe have been systematically targeted with arbitrary detention , arrest and torture .
We have a motion for a resolution on Nicaragua in which we have to take a number of factors into account .
In short , we want to condemn the alleged infringements of fundamental political rights , but without going to the extreme of placing the Government of Nicaragua in a difficult situation , so that it can go on performing its role of supporting the most deprived strata of its society .
It is also important to remember , however , that the fight against poverty cannot be compatible with the persecution and harassment of people who , for one reason or another , disagree with the official line .
Nevertheless , I also call on the Commission to consult with Parliament before coming to any decision on this matter .
He soon realised that there was not enough Venezuelan oil for him to do without that development aid .
I would also recall here that last week , on 12 December , the Spanish government decided to extradite Murat Gasayev to Russia .
Last July he recalled that the prisoners in the Yukos case , Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev , are detained in the Siberian prison of Chita .
Russia , attacks on Human Rights defenders and murder trial of Ana Politkovskaya (vote ) - Before the vote on paragraph 6 Mr President , I shall try to be brief and , of course , I must begin by also extending my warmest wishes to Commissioner Kroes in the hope that she recovers from her fall .
At the same time , however - and this is the core of our concern , I believe , and I understand it is also that of some of my fellow Members - public television broadcasters are absolutely vital in protecting our cultural and linguistic diversity and ultimately in binding our societies together because , in theory , they are looking for something more than direct profit .
For that to have been so , all the Member States should have transposed the directive within the given time period , done so properly and submitted all the information to the Commission .
