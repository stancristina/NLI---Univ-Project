briefly mention five courses of action outlined in our White Paper .
The direct responsibility for the ineffectiveness and unpopularity of European legislation lies primarily with the Member States .
To remedy this , the White Paper recommends using regulations in many cases where they would be more appropriate than directives .
If correctly applied , the existing Treaty would separate clearly the roles of Parliament , the Council , the Commission , the Court of Justice and the other institutions .
The Commission , which is supposed to be the executive , has to negotiate details with the legislator , but the Council assumes none of the consequent political responsibility because , in reality , it is officials from the national authorities - that is the Member States directly - that take part in the meetings of experts .
Respectfully but firmly , the White Paper suggests that the European Parliament should "depart from the present emphasis on detailed accounting " and move towards "more policy-oriented control based on political objectives " .
The people of Europe want this Union to be theirs .
Mr President of the Commission , in our common language , the word "governance " does not exist , and it may well be that it does not exist in other European languages either .
It is precisely because I want a strong , authoritative Commission that I am saying this .
We have indeed set out a road map in this document , but this is the just the initial proposal : debates will continue to be held and it is only during the next stage that the final document will be produced .
An example is the discussion on the term "governance " .
The fact that our relations are certainly more effective , more functional , smoother and more open than they were previously is precisely because I consider that the basis of the new Europe must be a fundamental role for Parliament .
In my opinion , as we have seen from my speech and your debates , it is possible to improve the way we work without amending any legislation .
An objection was raised regarding the direct responsibility of local authorities in the decision-making process .
A further point is the delegation of competences and agencies .
I would like to end by thanking you and by saying simply that we must view all this precisely in the context of the three stages of the major European reform which we have outlined and which will be implemented over the next three years : firstly , reorganisation of the way we work internally ; secondly , working together to plan how we should organise the major process of reforming the institutions , therefore Laeken ; and thirdly , how to carry out the process of reforming the institutions .
The current system has proved essentially effective , since the basic objective has been or is in the process of being achieved , while on the other hand it is proving ineffective , or rather in some cases I would say it acts against the incentive to make vehicles crossing Austria more eco-friendly , as well as being difficult if not unfair to implement , and therefore the clause has indeed proved to be effectively of little use , even though worthwhile in its intention .
I shall confine myself quickly to two puzzling facts .
The first is a matter of logic : the clause operates on the number of transit journeys , regardless of the ecological performance of the vehicle , and therefore more ecologically friendly vehicles mean more ecopoints saved , more journeys accumulated and a greater risk of going over the 108 % quota .
This is an error into which we must not fall , and I must say this with all due respect to the Members from Austria : your representation of the situation is not useful to your fellow citizens .
I ask you to take in the aspect of concern for the environment that is expressed in the Commission proposal ; I agree with you all that we certainly need to find stable , definitive solutions for the future , which will really protect us from these risks .
Therefore , the expression 'unity in diversity ' has been chosen as the motto of the report .
Such cooperation is affirmed , or rather invoked in the Treaties and official speeches , but funding does not follow as it could and should do .
If all this is true , you will of course allow me , Mr President , sincerely , in my capacity as committee Chairman , to congratulate the rapporteur in advance this evening - something that we generally do as a matter of course when we vote - because I really believe this is a step forward , a major revolution that Parliament is on the point of making .
From now on , the Union ' s institutions , particularly the representatives of the Council and the Commission , will no longer be able to say that information reported in the media is inaccurate .
However , we have , yet again , chosen to waste an opportunity , at least for us , to uphold a democratic principle .
We can see from the report that Echelon is a prime example of a system which does not recognise citizens ' right to privacy and subordinates privacy to national security , which is primarily endangered by the inability of politicians to foresee , prevent and deal with threats .
To increase the effectiveness of the report and with a view to the protection of citizens ' privacy , in particular , as well as companies , may I suggest to Mr Schmid , once again , and to the Members that they include some amendments tabled by Mr Di Lello and others , specifically Amendments Nos 12 , 20 , 21 , 22 and 30 .
