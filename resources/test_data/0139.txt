In many research areas , the JRC researchers find themselves in a situation much like a spider in a web.
There are reports on the twelve topics which we need to discuss in New York for each country , which show exactly how much progress has been made with the assessment .
For the next five years , I believe that the action programme , the five-year programme which the Commission is presenting for discussion at the moment , is of huge importance .
The Commission has made efforts , as has Europe , but mainly in the political sphere .
I would mention two areas , in particular .
I regret that the Group of the European People ' s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats have quoted Rule 115 , because the last version of the text , which was the French one , was actually issued at 1.02 a.m.
Mr President , Mrs Diamantopoulou , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I would like to thank everyone who has worked on this report , that is to say , all collaborators , but also the people from the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities and the interpreters , who have worked very hard .
In Belgium , 40 percent of the victims end up on the labour market , in the textile , hotel and catering and fruit-picking industries , bakeries and the construction industry , or as house staff or au-pair girls , obliged to work as slaves in degrading conditions .
Victims are also recruited for the marriage market , as well as to sports clubs and football clubs .
In order to tackle trafficking in people adequately , we first of all need a clear definition of trafficking in people .
Last year , the Council adopted the DAPHNE programme .
The initiatives which have been taken are the first step towards a solution but the number of victims continues to grow .
It is a growing problem in the EU , too .
Whenever new needs arise , emergency help is often provided by people or groups of people who feel compelled to do something about these on ideological grounds or out of religious conviction .
The fact that she managed to put this important topic on the European agenda is a huge achievement .
In our opinion , this is a bridge too far , because this would require the entire Geneva Convention to be overturned .
Finally , the discussion on trafficking in women and people is important and a matter of urgency .
With your help , I would like to try to tidy up the report a little and remove a number of redundant items .
On our desks , we have found an anonymous document which states that we will be voting on the Buitenweg report and also dealing with any remaining votes at 6.00 p.m.
The money that is available should be spent on the needs of our 375 million people and on the protection of our environment , not on the European Parliament as an institution .
Multilingualism is a prerequisite for the smooth running of the European Parliament for three reasons .
Recently , more than 400 Members once again stated that we want to decide for ourselves where we meet .
I have done so with great conviction because I am of the view that we as the European Parliament do not send out a political signal or pre-empt a political decision by adopting the Secretary-General ' s proposal ( and filling 35 vacancies in the language sector ) but accomplish this by doing the exact opposite .
We have all been able to see how the pleas addressed to Greece to make further efforts to reduce its debt and to obtain lasting stability do not only pertain to the situation of Greece itself , but also to the discontent about the way in which other Member States with a very high debt ratio have behaved , not making sufficient use of the options available to them , as a result of economic growth and low interest rates , to reduce the debt .
Over the past six months , it has become evident that values are increasingly at the centre of the debate .
It embodies a sound minimum level of protection against racism by means of sanctions and independent bodies , by which we set great store .
Indeed , although a distinction based on nationality may be completely understandable , it would , of course , be quite improper to let the colour of someone ' s skin be a deciding factor in their request for asylum or to treat the asylum request of a black person in distress differently from that of a white person .
At the same time , I recognise the fact that even more protection is not essential .
Mr President , first and foremost , I would like to warmly congratulate Mrs Buitenweg on the fact that she managed to finish the entire report , ready for discussion and vote , at the eleventh hour today .
This would then render my Amendment No 63 redundant , where religion is seen in a positive light , as we would thus redress the balance and have a clean report .
It is to be welcomed if legislation develops in this respect .
The distribution of the burden of proof is an important point which should be looked into by a committee such as the one mentioned above .
Regarding the other points of the report , I do have to say that the nature of a directive is such that you do not need to be too specific .
But this does not affect the core of the report , Mr President , which is what this is all about .
This is what the pioneers of the European Union once did and we
