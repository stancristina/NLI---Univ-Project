services and networks are fundamental if every citizen , enterprise or public authority is to have access to the type and amount of information that they need , including those situated in the least developed or peripheral regions .
Finally , I would like to congratulate the noteworthy conciliatory effort made by our Vice-President , Nicole Fontaine , and our rapporteur Mr Hoppenstedt .
Along these lines , it is in turn desirable that enlargement of the market should be extended to third countries , as agreed between 22 of the countries taking part in the Marrakesh meeting , which means that we must now make necessary amendments to Community directives .
Mr President , mobility is an essential condition for European construction .
If integration and cohesion are the basic objectives of the European Union , then mobility is one of its main instruments .
Why ?
And if this happens , future generations will definitely hold us responsible for that failure .
Despite the fact that the European Community 's Court of Justice recognized , recently even , the legal validity of the Community banana scheme , the Arbitration Committee of the World Trade Organisation , taking an extremely discretionary and , in our view , intolerable position declared , at the end of April , that this regime was contrary to the rules of international trade .
We fail to understand the position of certain Member States which apparently have already declared their opposition to such an attitude by the Commission which would fundamentally try to restore justice and keep alive the due solidarity between the European Member States and various regions of those States .
But the Leviathan does not want that to come about .
Who are they ?
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the findings of the preliminary report of the Banana Panel of the World Trade Organisation are contrary to the interests of the European Community and in particular to those of Portugal and the autonomous region of Madeira , which is a part of my country , and even more to the traditional banana exporters of the ACP countries .
Fifthly , setting up as a principle the maintenance and extension of various types of existing fisheries agreements , without any attempt to privilege any one of them , therefore attending to the various financial and economic characteristics and capacities of European Union fleets .
Access by the European Union 's fishery fleets to the waters of third countries only has a raison d 'être if it is in the interest of both parties .
In the face of these facts and circumstances , I think that we have every justification and can say that the current 270 million ECU spent annually on international fisheries agreements is money well spent .
But I must say , with every respect , that his report often confuses economic and commercial questions bound up with the common fisheries policy with questions which are more related to cooperation policy and tends in general to overestimate the problems of others compared with our own problems which are very many , especially in this area .
On the other hand , the Member States are systematically confronted with fleets and fishermen depending on international fisheries agreements .
That was the appeal I wanted to make because the political cost of such an option would be incalculable as well as the economic impact on fishery areas .
Mr President , in 1985 Portugal said 'no ' to nuclear power , when faced with an advanced project to build four nuclear power stations .
Why ?
In principle , I agree with André Soulier that countries should be able to choose their own system , a principle which is , after all , the basis of the whole European Union project , given that the Union can decide only to support programmes based on renewable energy sources and energy efficiency .
Something else which remained unsaid was that the Commission had failed to complain to the same WTO against the United States for its clear violation of trade rules and international law as a result of the Helms-Burton Act to strengthen the embargo against Cuba , which has already led to the arrest of a Spanish businessman who committed the 'crime ' of indulging in trade relations with that island republic .
Resolution on Zaire Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , with sad regularity the European Parliament is obliged to condemn the serious violations of human rights practised by the Indonesian authorities on its own territory and in the illegally occupied territory of East Timor .
How can we understand that , in the case of small countries , such as Togo or Equatorial Guinea we have ( rightly ) suspended aid and cooperation because of alleged violations of human rights and yet we pass over the same sacred principle when dealing with major countries where larger trade and economic interests are at stake ?
But I have to mention , in passing , the importance that I attach to the Rothe report , too , given its global view and the pragmatism of the measures contained in it .
This is a matter of a different reality fundamentally resulting from being cut off and the scarcity of certain resources and that naturally presents a specific joint framework warranting an integrated and differentiated approach on the part of the European Union .
We want to obtain the best possible treatment for these islands in order to offset the disadvantages caused by their island status and to promote equality of opportunity for their inhabitants .
In the present crucial phase of political reorganization in the Democratic Republic Congo , this lack of control over the armed forces can cause serious difficulties .
In Rwanda infiltrations across the border or under the cover of refugee repatriation have led to widespread insecurity
