If we take the context of this report we will see that it has to stand on its own merits .
If we add to that the Court of Auditors ' report on the operation of the political groups , we have come to the conclusion in our political group that we need to postpone discharge on its own merits .
It is not a question of the popping of champagne corks between Brussels and Strasbourg , that is an irrelevance if I might put it politely .
It is not a question of parallelism , it is a question of substance .
As for the admissibility of the amendment , I draw to the attention of the services of Parliament and to your attention , Mr President , the fact that Annex V of our Rules of Procedure does not apply to the Parliament discharge but applies to the Commission discharge and therefore our amendments should be considered to be admissible .
Secondly , I turn to Mrs Stauner ' s excellent report and the explanatory statement .
It is a pity Mrs Morgan is not still here in the Chamber , because I understood her to say that you cannot just leave a discharge to systems alone ; it is the question of access to information , so that we as a Parliament can grant discharge .
You can ask for access to information , but if you do not get it then you have to start applying a certain rigidity and postpone discharge .
The explanatory statement very clearly sets out the reasons for so doing .
I come to two points here .
The first is access to information .
We do not have at this time a framework agreement between Commission and Parliament - that is still outstanding in the context of Annex III .
Why ?
Because Parliament and the Commission cannot agree about what access we have to information .
The impression is left that we are foot-dragging , but in fact we are not getting complete answers to the questions put by Mr Bösch and Mr Blak .
Parliament is not getting the answers it requires .
Secondly , the question of the disciplinary procedure .
It is an arbitrary procedure .
It seems that high officials get off and ex-parliamentarians , who are in the Commission services get downgraded for no apparent reason and against the information available .
I am thinking of the case of Mr Zavvos in particular .
Therefore we , as a Parliament , should look at each of these cases as it stands .
My group will be in favour of postponing discharges both for the Commission and for Parliament until all the information is available to us .
Mr President , I shall focus on only one point : access to information .
Many of my colleagues have raised this issue this morning .
We need better access in order to move forward .
In my committee , the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , we are determined to take our responsibilities as MEPs very seriously indeed .
We have asked Members of Parliament to volunteer to follow budget lines .
These Members of Parliament are now approaching Commission services to talk to the officials responsible for those budget lines .
We are having problems and we are having problems in finding out who is the right person ; the people we talk to are not clear what their responsibility is , what information they should be giving us .
Some services cooperate very well ; some are setting up briefing meetings for Members of Parliament - but others are not .
What we need from the Commission is a new system .
We need a better reporting mechanism to parliamentary committees , to the spending committees , so that we know what information it is going to give us .
A start would be a list of who is responsible for what in which budget lines of each committee .
Only in this way can we do what we are supposed to do , and restore the public confidence that Mrs Schreyer spoke about this morning .
We need to know that money is being spent properly .
If we have that confidence we can pass that message on to the public in Europe .
My colleague , Mrs Morgan , spoke earlier about the need to overhaul the whole discharge procedure .
That is right .
For too long discharge was seen as something bureaucratic and rather unnecessary - something to get out of the way very quickly .
Now we have to move away from that , we have to overhaul it , and I hope proper reporting mechanisms to committees will be part of that overhaul .
Mr President , I welcome all the reports on the discharge procedures , especially Mrs Stauner 's report .
Before I make my initial comments , I just wish to welcome what Mrs McAvan said about access to information from the Commission .
I have found it remarkably difficult to get important documents and information from it on a number of occasions , especially for various budget lines relating to culture .
It would be very useful if the Commission were to release more information to us and give us the reports we ask for .
I welcome Mrs Stauner 's report for a number of reasons .
One because , as we are dealing with 1998 , we should be looking at the past and trying to find answers to the questions we have raised about Fléchard , ECHO and the MED problems .
These are all relevant nowadays because we must learn the lessons from them .
Any new proof that arises from these cases must be investigated .
These investigations must be very rigorous and must be reported back to us .
OLAF must use its teeth .
The three cases I
