European politicians aim their contributions to the European debate at the public in their own , rather than other , countries .
As will have been clear from my statement , we have an extensive and ambitious agenda for the Brussels Summit .
It is my hope and belief that all the countries will now show the necessary willingness to compromise and help to take the important decisions which I have spoken of here ; and I shall not , of course , conceal the fact that the questions that remain are particularly tough nuts to crack , and here I am of course speaking of the economy .
I would like to repeat and underline that the European Council is looking forward to hearing what the President of Parliament , Mr Cox , has to say and to exchanging views with him .
Speaking almost with one voice , Parliament said very early on , first in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , and then in plenary , what was to be done .
This is something for which , on behalf of the Presidency , I wish , moreover , to thank Parliament most warmly .
Ireland has won an emphatic 'yes ' to more jobs , to neutrality and enlargement , but there are neither jobs nor neutrality to be had from the Treaty of Nice , and , regardless of whether the Irish had voted 'yes ' or 'no' , enlargement would have gone ahead anyway , by taking Declaration 20 and moving applicant countries ' votes in the Council and seats in Parliament into the accession agreements .
Ireland is the most EU-friendly country there is .
Up to now I have had nothing but praise for the Danish Council Presidency .
Would Mr Rasmussen have stopped enlargement following an Irish 'no ' ?
He would probably have pulled another proposal out of the hat and secured enlargement without the Treaty of Nice .
The best that can be said about the Treaty is that it will only last for a year or two .
The Treaty of Nice is the worst mess to date .
Nice is ill-suited to secure popular support in the applicant countries .
Remove the stumbling block now and declare that there will still be a representative of each Member State on the Commission .
The subject of the Treaty of Nice was scarcely discussed this time and some skill went into ensuring that the Irish did not come to know about Mr Giscard d'Estaing 's first draft constitution .
The copies were numbered and were collected in again afterwards .
Vote 'yes ' or disappear .
Countries permitting their population to vote 'no ' will no longer be paid any attention .
The EU state comes before the voters .
No, thank you , Mr President .
Mr President , thank you for the statements by the Council and the Commission , and also sincere congratulations and thanks to the Irish people , who removed a great obstacle to enlargement last Saturday .
Only one in five Europeans feels 'well ' or 'very well ' informed .
Nor does it come as much of a surprise , because we have been aware of the problem for many years .
We must be prepared - as Mr Poettering mentioned - to find the necessary means .
The enlargement negotiations have now passed the point of no return and there must be no new demands made .
Admittedly , there is need for a radical reform of agricultural policy , but let us first put all the arrangements in place .
I am pleased with the results from the meeting of the Foreign Ministers in Luxembourg over the last couple of days , and it is particularly good news that agreement has been reached on the fact that none of the new applicant countries can under any circumstances start their membership of the EU as net contributors .
I am confident that the Council , headed by the Danish Presidency , will be able to accomplish this great historic task in Copenhagen in December .
Mr President , there is good reason to rejoice that Ireland has now accepted the Treaty of Nice , with its specific declarations on Irish neutrality .
Enlargement is a historic occurrence for which , in my opinion , both the Commission and the Danish Presidency have prepared the ground most competently .
I sense that the remaining problems are clear .
No new conditions for enlargement should be imposed .
On the other hand , of course , as we well know , the present and future members of the EU should be able to agree at the Copenhagen Summit in December on at least some of the principles for future agricultural and funding reform , which , as we know , will be necessary from 2006 .
It is also important that the outcome of negotiations we are aiming at is fair on the applicant countries , and that we bring about a fair competitive situation , possibly with slightly shorter transitional arrangements in the field of agricultural subsidies , so that referendums in the new Member States can obtain a 'yes ' vote .
With regard to the Kaliningrad issue , I also hope that a good enough solution can be found , so that the little enclave does not become a conflict region , but instead a positive player in the Baltic region ; a solution which of course fully respects both Lithuania 's sovereignty and its desire to become a member of Schengen .
We should be able to solve the transit question in a different way , possibly by means of a special passport system .
The criteria for the accession of new Member States were drawn up at the Copenhagen Summit in 1993 , and the process is to be concluded at the Copenhagen Summit in December .
