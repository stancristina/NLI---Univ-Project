In such cases , the codecision procedure is used .
Parliament ' s amendments , according to which , all the decisions made by the committee procedure would be brought before Parliament and where Parliament would have the right to amend or revoke them if they concern issues other than purely technical implementation measures are against the rules set out in the Comitology Decision .
However , I would finally like to emphasise that the Commission greatly values Parliament ' s seeking to play an active role in the decision-making process regarding the radio spectrum .
We accept Amendments 3 , 7 , 9 , 11 - 13 and 20 in principle .
This should be seen as a guiding principle in further preparation for the entry into force of the decision .
On this basis the Commission is ready to continue open cooperation with the European Parliament .
Madam President , President-in-Office of the Council , President of the Commission , Prime Minister , during your presidency we will be travelling down a long and winding road , which began with Nice and will end with Laeken .
I would now like to ask whether we must therefore return to Nice in order , finally , to get to Laeken .
For example , they did not all receive their rightful share of seats in the European Parliament .
I think that the European Union can continue its expansion , even if the Treaty of Nice should not be ratified in its present form , and you , Prime Minister , have an excellent opportunity in this respect .
At Laeken a consultative committee must certainly be set up , to commence drafting a constitution for the European Union and to deliberate on fundamental issues .
You mentioned globalisation .
Show you understand this concern , so that globalisation may then finally serve to benefit the development of the European social model , which you have named as one of your goals .
My group will lend you all the support it can in your efforts to continue the work Sweden began in the name of sustainable development .
In this connection I might say that the President-in-Office of the Council in the Transport Council represents my political group and is doing some creditable work .
Finally , as we approach Laeken , first the king ' s mighty castle appears on the horizon .
Remember that democracy and transparency are what are needed more than anything else , and do not in any event build more castles in Brussels for future European summits !
If you manage as much , your presidential term will have been a job well done .
I would like it to be recorded in the minutes that there is an error in the Finnish translation of the common position regarding Mrs Rothe ' s report .
I have not noticed any such omission in the other language versions .
This takeovers directive was and is an important part of the final implementation of the European single market .
I would just like to raise the question of how this will affect flows of capital in Europe .
Although Parliament has unfortunately not reproduced the definition we agreed on last time , according to which peat should count among the renewables , inasmuch as it regenerates each year , I would like to state that peat should be implicitly included in the version now agreed .
Every gardener knows that peat is a biodegradable product .
Bacteria and microbes cause it to decompose if it is taken away from its oxygen-free state .
As these are the facts , and they are not going to change , I hope that Parliament , the Commission and the Council will make the implicit explicit and make clear mention of peat in the future .
Environmental organisations , which based their views on outdated knowledge regarding the carbon cycle of marshlands , paradoxically opposed my design to prevent the exploitation of marshes , and this is the result : greed leads to a sorry end , and so , probably , does environmental greed too .
Mr President , the discussion of this report has in many ways shown the intolerably lightweight attitude to human rights amid the daily pressures of serious politics .
Nevertheless , human rights , which have even been called the last temporal religion of our time , go deeper than the politics of the day .
But , at the same time , it may seem less obvious that human rights are not just a convenient tool for driving political objectives , or , at worst , a pretext for action or inaction as dictated by common sense politics .
They must not nor cannot be sacrificed on the altar of mere political expediency or rhetorical commitment .
Internally , the proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , and , externally , both the EU' s annual report on human rights and , in particular , the latest Commission communication contain valuable points of view to consider in making human rights work more effective .
As Commissioner Patten said during the Finnish presidency at the EU' s first human rights forum in 1999 , it would be intellectual vandalism to ignore the opinions of NGOs as the knowledge and experience of the European human rights community is unparalleled in all the world .
But we must begin by improving our own approach .
We are ready to lecture others on these , but we can easily bypass them for compelling political reasons , as was the case just last week in connection with Slobodan Milosevic ' s rushed extradition .
For harsh criticism to be justified it must be based on fair play and impartial treatment .
In the light of that , thematic , topical choices would seem to be the best way to proceed , as now is the case
