Some of you – Mrs Bozkurt was the last – asked whether or not we would guarantee that the status of homosexual protection and the fight against homophobia in the Member States would be monitored .
I can assure you , Mrs Bozkurt , not only that such monitoring will be guaranteed but that it has already been done !
That too has been done , ladies and gentlemen !
The agency would be endowed with the powers that you propose , since it is the European Parliament’s duty to give its opinion on the subject and perhaps increase its powers of intervention .
Our aim in this programme , which began in late 2003 and is still ongoing , was to put together positive information to explain that diversity is a value for Europe .
This report , for which I am the rapporteur , does not call the Member States’ prerogative into question : the right to citizenship and the granting of citizenship are their prerogatives , as expressly laid down in the Treaties .
I believe that bloodline , birthplace and residence may , together and at the same time , constitute valid grounds for granting citizenship rights .
I believe it is a very important step , which has also obtained the approval of a great many social and trade union organisations within civil society , both religious and secular .
The problem is that many of these people do not have a clear idea of what rights and duties derive from it .
I personally am very much in favour of integrating third-country nationals who are residing and working legally on EU territory , and that is also the Commission ’s policy line .
There must , of course , be a thorough debate on the concept of European citizenship by residence .
Many of you are aware that I regard fighting the traffic in human beings as one of those personal priorities which , I believe , must achieve not only visibility but also tangible and significant results during my mandate .
This moral duty , as the report suggests , requires us to take an integrated approach based on the principle of having absolute respect for the dignity of every child , every woman and every man : every human being in general .
Personally , however – and I stress that this is my personal view – I feel that we must also address the issue of introducing tough measures to deter the clients , who are well aware that the girls they use are exploited and victims of trafficking .
The Commission has also attempted to base the approach to European legislation on the major guidelines drawn up by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child .
I am cooperating closely with Europol on enhancing their database , so as to be able eventually to set up a proper European statistical system providing reliable data .
I know that Parliament specifically wants that and , once you have drawn up a proposal to that effect , I shall be prepared to endorse it and to keep the instruments for preventing and combating the traffic in women and children ( the Daphne programme ) separate from the anti-drugs initiatives , as they are clearly distinct topics .
I fully agree with the idea of a European helpline for victims , particularly children .
I intend to write a formal letter to the German Government to recommend that specific preventive measures be taken during the 2006 football World Cup to prevent the influx and concentration of persons who would , unfortunately , be destined to go into prostitution during that period .
The last subject on which I should like to focus is information exchange : more information must be given to the countries of origin , but also more information must be exchanged within European Union Member States .
I repeat : 13 countries , and coordinated by Europol .
The result of that is further destruction of the economies of developing countries , and we must not forget that 70 % of the world’s population lives off the land .
In addition , the development aid promised has not been confirmed in precise figures , and it has not even been specified whether it will consist of actual aid or loans : it is pure window dressing that is being exposed for the sham that it really is .
Perhaps Europe was not entirely to blame , but we were partly to blame – not Commissioner Mandelson , but Europe itself .
In plain words , that means European markets are being flooded with very low-cost goods , which in fact cost a great deal in terms of human rights violations , worker exploitation and a lack of environmental protection .
I therefore call for the safety of our ports and the professionalism of their workers to be prioritised .
We need to protect the efficiency of public services and to recognise their requirements in the areas of safety , quality and accessibility .
Without this noble work , which the directive would wipe out for the sake of free-market policies , there would be no future for Europe .
We have to clarify the rules on competitiveness in view of the risk of unfair competition from the East and , even more importantly , we must reaffirm the environmental guarantees for the Mediterranean , which is under attack by operators who do not respect Community environmental legislation .
In doing so , Europe must endow itself with the dignity it deserves , and it must attempt to interpret as well as it can the new needs and rights of citizenship , which emerge in any case even before the law can take account of them .
In order to help fight the Mafia and similar criminal networks , I again propose – as I did in
