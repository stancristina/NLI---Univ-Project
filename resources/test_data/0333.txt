cooperation for each case and for each topic to be dealt with .
Mr President , this report makes an honest attempt to tackle the issues , but in very traditional areas , and it raises a few questions of principle that I would like to deal with .
I think that is important .
The reports contain very strong proposals to this effect .
We must also legally recognize that the Treaty is drawn up in such a way that it is directed towards an ever closer union of the nations of Europe .
There was never a Soviet people when the Soviet Union existed , and when Yugoslavia existed there was also no Yugoslavian people , and despite that no-one questioned the status as a state or the legal personality of these organizations and these states !
I would like to thank him for his helpful and considerate cooperation and to wish him all the best for his new post .
No national constitutional court can set itself up as ruling over Community law .
Mr President , allow me to say first of all that it is my custom to refrain from complimenting the rapporteur not out of a lack of politeness or because of the content of his report , but rather because of the need to be concise .
Yet the Alber report also says - and I consider this to be very important - that there can only be a common Europe , now and in the future , if this Europe uses all the means at its disposal to protect fundamental rights , exactly as this report formally requests .
My second point is that if we conclude a treaty , it must of course cover human rights .
What are we doing to preserve the environment ?
With two-figure growth rates , high-rise buildings were shooting up like mushrooms , output and exports were booming like never before , and Europe was starting to feel the aggressive competition in trade and had to - and is still having to - contend with job relocation .
So at present there can be no question of an agreement with the new ruler of Cambodia , Hun Sen, who literally walked over dead bodies to achieve power , nor can there be any question of supporting the military regime in Burma , which shows contempt for humanity , finances itself from the drug trade and from smuggling , and which accordingly has an unhealthy influence on its neighbouring countries , which out of poverty are driven to grow opium .
I would like to know what 'examining this problem ' means .
Macedonia is a small country with various neighbours and a very complicated history , and it has repeatedly been in danger of being overwhelmed by this history .
I would like to add how pleased I am that this cooperation agreement with Macedonia has fallen on such fertile soil in this Parliament .
That is similar to what was done earlier by Mr Pinheiro , who visited the capitals of Member States to form a view on the continuation of the Parity Meeting , the relationship between the ACP and the EU.
The history of relationships is a history of partnership , and we must maintain this partnership .
A new impetus to our relationship is therefore essential .
That is also a reason for our talking it over in such detail today .
Sanctions might consist , for example , of withdrawal of export licences , or import quotas granted to third countries .
As long as we do not realise that animals are not goods , maintained just for our profit , nothing will change here .
If we want to be able to face ourselves in the mirror , or - as many , including myself , still do - got to church and pray , then we do not have the right to treat creatures , who are similar products of creation , in the way we do today .
In Austria , for example , we introduced on our own initiative , in April this year , an animal transport inspector on the busiest motorway route .
This financial system must also be used to achieve something close to all our hearts , namely that as few animal transports as possible , as few movements of live animals as possible , take place in Europe , and that freezer transportation is available .
It is shameful and outrageous , what we get up to!
I was then on official duty , in my capacity as a member of the Latin American delegation , en route for Brazil .
Journalism of this kind is in my opinion poorly researched and , as such , worthless .
I was previously unaware that the Commission could express an opinion on matters of urgency .
I believe these to be important steps towards improving Europe 's competence in this area .
The emphasis on the significance of the market-oriented concept is obvious .
Finally , let me cite an unrealistic example of a rational application .
Thirdly and lastly , we must also see to it that earth-bound broad-band networks , which allow access to the new system , are also extended to cover a greater area , otherwise the benefits of the new technology will only be available to our towns and cities and the rural areas will be left out .
We have in some respects brought industry closer together , we work with it and there is quite a good ongoing debate .
But these are really ideological arguments which , I hope , we have now left far behind .
However , initially we require this system for quite conventional purposes , such as the landing of aircraft
