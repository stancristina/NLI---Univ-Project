Despite reforms in recent years , China is a long way from meeting the standards of the rule of law .
Had a vote taken place , the college of Commissioners would have had the PPE-DE Group’s virtually unanimous endorsement .
My second conclusion is this .
Mr Barroso has alluded to some of them , and it is a subject to which I shall shortly return .
That , today , is something I want to have set down .
We all know and respect many of the Presidents of the Commission who were Catholics , and I take it as read that former Commissions – and certainly this one , although I have not checked – included or include many Catholics and persons of other faiths .
So we urge you to prepare yourself ; we Liberals and Democrats will be a critical partner over the next few years .
We must once again take it as read – indeed , we already know – that the party leaders and Heads of Government , be they Schroeder or Blair or anyone else , have been on the phone , not only to you , Mr Barroso , but also to the widest possible variety of their colleagues .
The idea , present in the European Constitution , that this House reinforces the Commission ’s legitimacy , has come into effect even before the Constitution has been ratified , something that I , as Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , can only welcome .
Anyone reading reports of what has gone on over recent weeks will know that this freely-elected Parliament has notched up some points ; our commitment to Europe and its citizens has become more visible than ever before .
We must therefore assume in his favour that , as foreign minister , he was always abroad when these laws were adopted .     Madam President , Mr Barroso , ladies and gentlemen , the Barroso Commission and the European Parliament have been strengthened .
The Commission and Parliament need to regard each other , in principle , as allies , and that not only because of the attitude of some governments .
Let me also say that our group finds it regrettable that the motion on subsidiarity tabled by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group was not adopted .
Let me pick up what you said about a blind date , which was a fine phrase to choose .
For that reason , the democratic progress we have achieved is , for us , the beginning of a battle that we will be waging for five years .
I have just voted in favour of the new Commission .
Yet there is one thing of which we must be aware ; none of these factors can justify the use of violence or human rights violations .
I am therefore delighted that this House has responded to the urgent need for joint measures , and made known its opposition to the imminent execution of the Buddhist lama Tenzin Delek Rinpoche , who was not given a fair trial , and whose execution is scheduled for early December , without there being any proof of his guilt .
Yet how is China to gain trust or approval if it does not observe human rights or respect minorities ?
One should rather say the dramatic situation which we are also faced with in Eritrea , as we face drastic developments of this kind in many African countries .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , let me start by saying that I too want to firmly advocate a non-violent solution in Ukraine , and I would like to follow on from what Mr Nicolaï has said today about the situation there .
The first is that democracy must be safeguarded .
The action plans devised for this offer each and every partner a perspective that is ambitious , but above all tailor-made .
The European Union and all its European citizens are solidly behind Ukraine .
It also shows that it is not the European Union alone that gives itself important tasks , but that it is also sought out as a partner in dialogue and accepted as a mediator .
I am glad that we are setting out this very evening and that this joint delegation of the European Parliament has at last been put together .
Anything else would be yet another manipulation intended to deny the leader of the opposition the chance of an election victory .
That the High Representative was willing to go to Kiev only when this House insisted on it was a mistake on his part .
As you can see , we have been far from inactive , but I do believe that the various institutions in which we all work should complement each other in the work they do .
Perhaps the mere announcement of safety nets and alternatives of this kind and the fact that we are discussing them will help all the parties involved to become aware of their responsibilities and – with next year’s referendums in sight – will help to make it clear that we in the European institutions are willing and able to announce , at the right time , that we have succeeded in reaching agreement on the Financial Perspective .
If one is to accept such a great challenge , one already associated with such bellicose language and accompanied – in that figures have already been produced for our consideration – by the opening of many secondary theatres of war , it is a good thing to keep a cool head and work through things in a systematic fashion .
That was nine years ago !
What that means is that they are juggling two timetables , and , speaking as a regional politician , I can only describe that as irresponsible .
At the summit on 25 November , it became clear that we could talk in a
