to a particular state with which they have connections in some way and in which optimum social rehabilitation is believed to be a real possibility .
The June List has therefore voted against the report as amended by Parliament – – a report that , amongst other things , contains wordings promoting European criminal law .     We wish to emphasise that the June List is opposed to engaging in propaganda in favour of a liberal approach to drugs .
We have thus voted against the report on strengthening the role of the centre .     We voted in favour of the resolution as a whole but have some important objections .
The resolution places too much of the responsibility on the EU.
There are thus good reasons for the EU countries to coordinate the measures adopted and the political decisions taken .
We have thus chosen to vote in favour of the report as a whole .
We question individual points in the report , such as the need for the Commission to devise a comprehensive communication strategy together with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC ) .
We are critical of the fact that the European Parliament is in this way exploiting a significant political issue in order to extend the EU’s international political role .     The report concerns the consequences of the European Court of Justice’s judgment C-176/03 , which gave the EU powers to adopt , under the first pillar , necessary sanctions under criminal law in order to guarantee that full effect is given to the provisions of the first pillar , in this case in relation to the environment .
In spite of this , the Commission has stated that there is no limit to the degree to which criminal law might be brought within the competence of the Community and that , in principle , all the areas regulated by the EC Treaty might be subject to such transfers of authority .
These may sometimes be needed in order , for example , to deal with vessels out at sea that are ruining the environment .     The June List is opposed to all forms of discrimination , whether based on gender , race , ethnic origin , religion or conviction , disability , age or sexual orientation .
Of that there can be no doubt .
They have the cheek to come up with their own interpretation of the results in terms of dissatisfaction with existing governments in the two countries .
The same applies in , for example , the United Kingdom , Sweden and Denmark and perhaps a number of other countries .
We should also have liked to have seen more ambitious long-term goals specifically set out .
These are all things that we must , of course , get to grips with in a way that takes account of the long term .
We should reflect on this in the long term .
We think that the Sustainable Development Strategy should not , in the first place , be seen as an obstacle to , or problem for , growth and development but , rather , as an opportunity .
The world is crying out for intelligent solutions to , for example , our energy and transport problems .
We see the EU leaving an ever bigger ecological footprint on the world , a state of affairs that we must , of course , do something about .
Finally , I wish to emphasise the importance of research issues .
Finally , we must get to grips with the problem of the EU’s increased ecological footprint .
They are linked together rather than integrated .
The administrative dimension is emphasised to an unnecessary degree in the resolution , which sometimes shows too little appreciation of the realities of the business world .
We are not opposed to the strategy .
Following the review that has now been carried out , we think that the resolution has acquired a tone that we can , in general , support .     Mr President , the Lisbon Strategy’s objectives are mistaken .
Instead , the result is increased stress , more environmental damage , wider social disparities and more injustice .
More money is also going to research into carbon-based energy and to research into other non-sustainable forms of energy .
Why do we not take the relevant decisions ?
It goes to show that there are very unpleasant and dangerous trends directed against homosexuals among the peoples of Europe .
One of the fundamental principles of a democracy is freedom of assembly , which is also safeguarded in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms .
We do not , however , need to look outside the EU in order to find similar examples .
Certainly , freedom of religion too is one of the fundamental freedoms , but it should under no circumstances whatsoever be used as an excuse for oppressing others .
What should not under any circumstances happen is for the issue of homophobia to be addressed for the purpose of making cheap political points .     Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to thank Mr Costa for a constructive report .
These are about the distinction between postal mail and traditional cargo and about protection against terrorist attacks .
The period within which mail is distributed should not be several days , a state of affairs of which Europeans would take a very dim view .
The fact is that , through ramps and other aids , we have made aviation accessible to everyone .
I applaud the report .     Mr President , Mr Bösch has carried out a very conscientious and , in certain respects , brilliant survey of irregularities and fraud taking place in various parts of the European Union and in a number of its authorities
