I would like to stress the fantastic and magnificent , although not unlimited , potential of European society , which could be taken better advantage of .
Do you see it as an effective contribution to efforts at finding a solution to the violence ?
It should not be forgotten that some lorries are already fitted with such devices and that , according to this measure , a reduction of just 5 km/hour in the average speed on European Union roads would result in no fewer than 11 , 000 lives being saved each year .
But then we say that such substances must be abolished as and when potential alternatives become available .
And so on .
However , the average is 0.30 % - down from 0.35 % , admittedly - which means that the European Union , although not the perfect champion of environmental issues , can still offer an example to other countries .
I refer both to the 72 amendments which were examined in committee and to the 17 to be examined here today in this part-session .
It has instigated an administrative investigation and has sought to discover how far the companies cited in the report might have been involved in other programmes , in other DGs and even in other divisions .
I have nothing but praise for the UCLAF , since I have been a member of the Committee investigating fraud in Community transport and I have been able to witness how effective it is and what fine work it does .
For this reason - and this is the principal complaint made about the Commission 's proposal from a financial control standpoint - we would insist on the immediate establishment of the national supervisory agencies .
We are therefore talking about over 300 , 000 jobs which , as explained here , involves ecu 1000 million .
Mr President , I , too , would like to congratulate Mr Rosado Fernandes on his report and would like to add , in connection with the tobacco crop produced in Objective 1 regions - the European Union 's poorest regions - that we should not speak demagogically of crop substitution .
Disengagement from the sector would be one more disaster leading to an increase in the drift towards the towns and cities .
Madam President , honourable colleagues , on 23 July - as we have been reminded - in the State of Virginia , an innocent man may be put to death .
This was , I believe , quickly forgotten and was not discussed further .
We cannot prematurely demand all the results before the agreement has seen the light of day and entered into force .
We should spare a thought for other people .
The process of transferring shared competences to the European Union has not been accompanied by developments in the leading role of the social partners .
Therefore , employers and employees , through their representative organizations , have to transfer the leading role they have at national level to the European level and , from that European level be much more active in applying common actions and measures to promote employment .
Today , even , the US multinational , Electrolux , is threatening to cut twenty thousand jobs in Europe - some of these are in Alcal√° de Henares , Spain , a country with 20 % unemployment .
We know that there is going to be a summit in Luxembourg , but are very much afraid that , as Mr Juncker told us the other day in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , if there is no finance for such job creation , the summit will not be sufficiently forceful in creating the employment we all need .
I believe that the overall result is balanced and that it picks up the majority of the Socialists ' amendments , about which we are very happy .
We would also commend the rapporteur 's spirit of openness .
We understand the needs of sampling , to make management more flexible , but we cannot grant carte blanche .
The day on which a Member State has to return properly utilized funds , from the structural funds , I have no doubt that at least the press in that country , and possibly other Community countries as well , will make it front-page news , at least in the economic section of the press .
So I would like to explain why we , the Chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy and I , as rapporteur , were moved to sign a joint amendment , bearing in mind that this was included in the code of conduct .
We have been aware for many years , now , of how the financial corrections in the EAGGF Guarantee sector operate , designation of a body in each Member State which is accountable to the Commission , accreditation of paying agencies , etc. , etc .
Yet when it came to the structural fund money , it preferred to look elsewhere .
We should give the Commission the means of control in those countries which are implementing the structural funds .
If this change is made , which reports or agenda items will be delayed as a result ?
But the Azzolini report contributes new and worthwhile approaches .
Guidelines in the search for solutions can be obtained by identifying the causes which encourage violence : social isolation ; lack of support , awareness and parenting skills ; and , above all , bad childhood experiences .
What is certainly true is that violence against women , which was originally thought of as a question of human rights , has also been recognized as a serious public health problem .
Mainstreaming of non-violence in education and advertising is also necessary .
The tragedy of these situations is viewed
