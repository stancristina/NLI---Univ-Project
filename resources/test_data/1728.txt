Things are getting out of proportion , and that is the case here .
This I would venture to claim , coming as I do from the same country as the Linux system .
That it would set the big , bad supranationals against SMEs has been exaggerated and is an artificial argument .
The big companies will always get by even without rules , but clear rules , on the other hand , always benefit the small ones .
It is the foundation of the modern , successfully functioning market economy .
It provides certainty and is , moreover , protection against the pirates .
At present , there is no harmonised legislation on patents in Europe .
Hopefully , this will not turn into another example of how Europe shoots itself in the foot and weakens its competitiveness .     Mr President , I wish to thank the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe , Mr  Hatzidakis , for his excellent levels of cooperation in the debate on the report on the general Regulation .
I hope that it will also be adopted more or less as it is in tomorrow’s vote .
Mr  Hatzidakis’s report follows these principles .
There have been pressures to violate these principles in the debate on the reform .
There is no good argument for this .
There are particular problems in the major cities , but they should not be solved using regional policy appropriations or the Union’s budget in general .
The present system is absurd , as the largest amounts of aid are paid in those regions where the conditions for production are most favourable .
I have to say , it is no wonder that European competitiveness is on such shaky ground , when people cannot keep to such a simple rule as a timetable .
I hope that the Bureau might reflect on this and also do something about it for the future .
Last week , the Commission submitted the negotiating framework for Turkey to the Member States and it is the most rigorous framework ever presented by the Commission .
Let us be frank .
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report .
I welcome in particular the report’s focus on promoting women’s participation in the workforce , increasing the representation of women in decision-making positions and combating domestic violence against women , and especially the need for more shelters for the victims of violence .
I share the rapporteur’s appreciation of the Turkish Government’s efforts to introduce constitutional and legislative reforms , for instance the penal code , which addresses the situation of women and promotes gender equality .
I shall give you some very concrete examples .
Now it is a matter of implementation , implementation , implementation .
This report on women’s rights in Turkey points out that women constitute only 4.4 % of the Turkish parliament .
We cannot demand of Turkey more than what we ourselves are prepared to do .
Accordingly , the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe tabled Amendment 3 .
Encourage women to participate more in politics ; be bolder than the heads of many of the current Member States of the Union !
It would be enough if action were taken there .
Finally , I wish to thank the rapporteur , who has done some excellent work .
I will just respond to two or three points made by most of the speakers .
Firstly , as the rapporteur , Mrs Pack and many others said , implementation is indeed at the heart of the matter , as is a change of mentality .
We therefore support , and will reinforce our support for , awareness-building measures to strive for a change in mentality and mindset regarding the practical application of women’s rights and the attitude of the security forces , for instance , in terms of human rights in general .
That will certainly enhance women’s participation and European values of gender equality and women’s rights .
I recall that the Member State I know best has , for quite some time , had quotas to enhance women’s participation in public decision-making .
On 3 October , we will start a long and no doubt difficult journey .
It is important to realise that it is precisely the prospect of accession that provides the incentive for Turkey to enhance women’s rights .
I can assure you that the Commission will carry out objective and strict monitoring in the course of these accession negotiations .
Community legislation up till now has been unable to eliminate this area of inequality .
We need stricter requirements , we need legal sanctions , and we need results .
We need to adopt proper procedures in the Member States .
We were just saying that Turkey needs to implement legislation and that it is not enough merely to agree with just laws .
Instead of spurring on the social partners , the Member States should ensure that they implement and promote the principle of equal treatment , and thus do what EU treaties and legislation prescribe .
Hopefully , we will reach consensus with the Commission and the Council regarding objectives .     Mr President , Mr Bowis made reference to his 100-year-old mother .
I should add that this was on Saturday , not two days ago .
Firstly , on making poverty history .
I think it is a great subject for the British Presidency .
It seems that we have made the least progress on trade .
Three things .
It is wrong that the World Bank and the IMF make non-agricultural subsidies a precondition when we do exactly the opposite .
Just as we have a Mediterranean strategy , and just as we had a Russia strategy , we need an Africa strategy .
That Africa strategy should lend our
