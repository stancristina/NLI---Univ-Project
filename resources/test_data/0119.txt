not have any salmonella in Sweden .
No less than 85 % of the tests on poultry from France showed that the meat was contaminated .
I do not think Commissioner Fischler 's answer really explained things , although I am certainly grateful for it .
Is it not the case that it should be every country 's natural right to be able to protect itself against products which are harmful to health ?
It is clear , Mr Commissioner , that in this area we have two different methods .
In the same consignment using the Swedish method we find salmonella bacteria , while using the other method we do not find any salmonella bacteria .
I interpret the end of your reply to mean that you will also use the Nordic method as a routine measure and that it will at least be given equal status with the current method used under the relevant EU directive .
The intention of the proposal is to round off the annual harmonized statistical data for the carriage of goods by road to ensure the availability of information for the monitoring and evaluation of the common policy .
Of course , there always have to be statistics to some extent .
However , there are two positive things in this context .
That means that vehicles with payloads of up to 3.5 tonnes or maximum permissible laden weights of up to 6 tonnes are excluded .
A constant criticism is increasingly being made of the EU , a criticism about bureaucracy and excessive information being required of companies .
Three of them concern programmes to prevent accidents , rare diseases and pollution-related diseases and the fourth is about the health aspects of EU policies .
It is important to prevent and avoid disease .
I think not .
Other tasks include developing methods for relatives and carers to relate to those suffering from dementia so that for all concerned existence is given life and meaning .
We want the EU to show how to reconcile differences and how democracies working together through voting can solve their problems and become a force in the world .
The meaning of the decision in Luxembourg was , as we understand it , that countries which make a special effort should be able to catch up , in other words , it should be possible for them to catch up with the first group .
Just as we consider it necessary for the parliaments of the applicant countries to be involved in the enlargement process and to participate actively in it - my own experience from Sweden when we negotiated our membership demonstrated the importance of that -, we also consider it a matter of course that this Parliament should participate in the various stages of the negotiations , not as a negotiating party , but as a party whose task is to monitor and give opinions and thereby help to create understanding for this extremely important process .
The question concerned whether the acquis screening was the same for the 5+1 and for the other applicant countries .
I would like to ask what you think of the tendencies , which I sometimes find in this Parliament , where people are afraid of social dumping .
However , I promise that I will pay great attention to the answer in the Minutes and to further discussions .
As I see it , such an action plan can hardly be compatible with support for liberal drug projects .
On the one hand , we have an action plan to combat drugs , while on the other hand , there is support for the legalization of drugs .
As a Swede it is clear that I would rather see support go to projects which represent the view held by the UN conventions .
Large amounts of drugs are seized in the EU which have entered from countries outside the EU.
I will try to be very brief .
Perhaps you should not be so sure about who is guilty .
We must , of course , be very creative when we try to reduce costs .
Instead , we should consider doing what a number of countries have already done , which is to include housework as pensionable work .
Personally I have become increasingly frustrated by the fact that we get quick cooperation in the first pillar to protect economic interests , but when we need protection through legal cooperation , often for the express purpose of protecting the citizens , it is difficult to bring about , which sometimes contributes to creating a false picture of the Union and its aims .
I think it is important for consumer organizations and the authorities , for example , to be able to do something about this .
However , our group does not support the amendments proposed by the Group of the European People 's Party .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mrs Fontaine for her excellent work .
But what is being done ?
When are you on the Council going to realize that money which goes into the cultural and educational sectors is vital investment ?
We are thus in favour of cooperation within the framework of ASEM , but would like to stress the importance of involving elected politicians , including in the framework of ASEP , and referendums .
Relations with other non-democratic Asian countries are also characterized by double standards .
We question the direction and forms of aid to North Korea 's suffering population , not least the investment in KEDO.
As well as several demands which I have already mentioned , there are also requests for a code of conduct for the sale of arms by EU countries and criteria for sustainable forest management .
Unfortunately this will not be the last time , because the report which came recently from the German Red Cross is horrifying .
