This is a crucial aspect that we must resolve .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have before us an agreement of great importance , both for Equatorial Guinea and for various regions in Europe .
To conclude , I should also like to highlight the fact that there are tuna fishing methods , such as those using lines and poles , as practised in all of the Micronesian islands , that pose no threat to dolphins and turtles as other , more aggressive methods and techniques do .
Parliament must therefore give due recognition to the importance of these agreements , not only because they will contribute towards improving relations between the European Union , its Member States and the countries of the southern cone of the American continent , but also because they will foster greater balance in the development of partnerships for cooperation in Latin America .
The purpose of my second comment is to state that the mandate for negotiations considers both the political and cooperation approaches in addition to the trade aspect , which is to be expected .
Our greatest concern should be that we sign agreements that are effective and mutually advantageous to the Union , to the Member States and to the communities for which they are designed .
This amending budget is inadequate and provides only temporary measures , although it does respond to the urgent need to finance the costs of the BSE crisis .
The purpose of such a reform must be to protect agricultural production , in full respect for food safety , to protect food quality , to promote the specific nature of the various regions and to promote economic and social cohesion .
The idea is to make them more dependent on the Commission , with the aim of creating a regulatory framework at EU level for greater coordination or even the harmonisation of trade rules , which will favour multinational companies in the sector and mergers between them .
At such a time , I appeal to the executive authority of the Union and to this Parliament to take whatever steps are necessary to help improve the living and working conditions in the fishing industry so that we can , as far as possible , avoid this type of accident which , these days , particularly afflicts the seamen of Galicia .
The second point to stress is that the European Union must be willing to make an extra effort to reduce internal support in market access and export subsidies .
Fifthly , it is important to highlight the initiative aimed at the less developed countries , but we must take steps to prevent this measure from being exploited by those not entitled to use it .
Mr President , Commissioner Pascal Lamy , I should like to congratulate Messrs Konrad Schwaiger and Arlindo Cunha on the reports and documents they have presented here , and also highlight the contributions made by all our colleagues in both the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy and the Committee on Agriculture .
The third essential point , already mentioned here by both Konrad Schwaiger and Arlindo Cunha , has to do with our safeguarding of the multifunctional role of agriculture .
Since I know Commissioner Pascal Lamy ' s positions on this , I am sure that this role will also be performed .
With regard to agriculture too , although it includes certain changes made by the Committee on Agriculture specifically to ensure food safety and food quality , it does not take into account other major amendments , such as the one we tabled on the review of the Blair House agreement , with particular regard to protein-rich plants , given the BSE crisis and the part played by animal meal .
Therefore the Commission will confine itself to three main remarks .
I must say that I see it very differently .
In the long run it will be necessary to go further and look coherently at all means of transport including freight transport .
Meanwhile , dead bodies are appearing on the beaches of the south of the Iberian Peninsula , many of them women and children who have perished in an attempt to reach land in search of work and opportunities for earning a living lacking in their home countries .
With regard to the Frahm report , I believe that we should also support the rapporteur 's position , which is to reject the Portuguese initiative .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the initiative we have before us to create a European crime prevention network is intended as a response to the growing need to fight crime .
It is vital to guarantee the safety of Europe 's citizens , who wish to live in peace , and this increasingly means not only effectively fighting crime but also adopting intelligent crime prevention policies which also involve the capacity to understand and react to psychological and sociological phenomena which make people feel unsafe , or increase such feelings .
I believe that the compromise amendment approved was a good solution , as it did not exclude any aspect of crime prevention .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report and to say very simply , given the late hour , that the Commission supports the Franco-Swedish initiative to create a European crime prevention network .
( PT ) We broadly agree with the rapporteur 's view that the Commission 's basic proposal to reduce sugar quotas by 115 000 tonnes should be rejected .
Similarly , with regard to the Azores , we believe that it is vital to guarantee the viability of the only existing plant , on the island of SÃ£o Miguel , whose operation is essential for that ultraperipheral region .
