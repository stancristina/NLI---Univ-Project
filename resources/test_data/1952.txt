By its very nature , this is an open-ended process whose outcome cannot be guaranteed beforehand .
The EU will evolve over this period , and Turkey should change decisively and fundamentally .
Turkey’s cultural roots are more diverse than most of us realise .
They are also to be found in the cultures of Europe , the Caucasus and the Mediterranean .
We now have to fulfil the promise Turkey was given during the Finnish Presidency .
If Islam were a barrier , we would be declaring that the 15 million Muslims , three times the population of Finland , who now live in EU countries are second class citizens .
Leyla Zana , winner of the Sakharov Prize in 1995 , told us in October to include Turkey in the negotiations or else the Kurds would not survive .
Turkey needs to fulfil all the requirements of European democracy , including the rights of women .
It is important that the negotiations can be broken off at any time if there is insufficient progress .
We will not be ready for enlargement for a long time , but we can begin negotiations now .
What amazes me most about Turkey’s membership is the great haste in which it is being pursued .
In Turkey’s case , we cannot turn a blind eye to the matter of human rights .
External estimates suggest quite enormous sums of money .
The contributions by the current net contributors would grow substantially .
After Turkey has joined , the Union will no longer be the same EU as it is now .
I fear that Turkey’s accelerated accession is too big a mouthful to swallow , and that the EU is likely to choke on it .     .
First , there have been numerous requests for rigorous monitoring of legal reforms and human rights in general .
It is also very much in the interests of Turkey because it maintains the strong incentive to implement and consolidate the necessary legal and political reforms .
We will be preparing a monitoring report during 2005 concerning the fulfilment of criteria in the field of human rights in general .
He referred to an ongoing court case of which the Commission is aware .
This also involves the question of non-Muslim religious minorities , which has been addressed in depth by Mr Eurlings in his report and referred to by several Members here this evening .
A draft law on foundations is currently being discussed and the Commission has been officially invited to submit its comments to the Turkish authorities on this critical piece of legislation .
The Union now has clauses in Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union and in the draft Constitutional Treaty that provide for a procedure to deal with cases where a Member State seriously and persistently breaches the basic principles of the Union .
It is only logical and normal that similar rules should also apply to candidate countries .
Thus the inclusion of an explicit suspension procedure is based on a new and the Commission will base its proposal on these principles of the Treaty .
It is intended to give special treatment to neighbours or other partners representing a strategic interest for the European Union .
It is hard to figure out how any more could be offered to Turkey than it already has under the privileged partnership .
Third , in the key area of security and defence , Turkey participates as a NATO member – via both NATO and the European Security and Defence Policy – in the development of EU security operations .
For instance , there are Turkish troops in many countries in the Balkans , and even in the ' European army ' , as one British newspaper recently dubbed the ' Althea' operation in Bosnia .
It would not be wise to set any final target date because we have recently learned that schedule should not override substance .
Our mandate is to evaluate whether Turkey fulfils the Copenhagen political criteria .
From the point of view of the Commission , I can say that we are ready to start work – in the words of Parliament 's resolution – 'without undue delay ' .
Mr Swoboda , Mr Szent-Iványi and several others made the very important point that if we succeed in this long process of negotiations , it should and will make the EU strategically stronger .
This is the fundamental issue at stake here and the strategic , geopolitical and geocultural crux of the matter .
During the Cold War , Europe contained Communism and the Soviet Union and cooperated in terms of enhancing security and human rights with impressive results .
Europe must , on the one hand , contain Islamic fundamentalism using all the means available and , on the other hand , it must build bridges and dialogue with those representing moderate Islam .
One important area of focus with regard to policy is , unquestionably , security .
Our citizens must feel that their lives and living conditions are safe .
Another important area of focus is something that is often mentioned here : competitiveness .
The President of the Commission presented a list of tasks in connection with Lisbon and it must actually be implemented ; it cannot be allowed to remain just a ‘wish list’ .
A stable , healthy and growing economy nevertheless requires instruments such as the Stability and Growth Pact .
If enlargement comes about too quickly , it might lessen our chances of achieving the results we want to see in the economy and with regard to security .
They are the European economic and social model which we advocate , and developing the area of freedom , security and justice .
For all this to be achieved , principles of sustainable development need to be applied .
Within the Union a sort of non-solidarity movement has
