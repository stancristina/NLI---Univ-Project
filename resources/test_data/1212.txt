education .
We cannot promote the liberalisation of markets and free movement at the expense of patient safety and consumer protection .
We have to focus attention on the quality of the education received , and not merely the length of time taken , when we are determining the levels of professional qualifications .
Can you assure us that when that final decision of the Council is taken , we will have access to full documentation before Parliament has to make its final decision ?
The Parliament’s budget is a complex administrative budget demanding a good deal of familiarity with Parliament’s working methods and procedures .
The Parliament’s budget is still characterised by the shortcomings caused by enlargement .
The situation appears to be especially problematic in the linguistic sector .
As it is the case that for the European Parliament to function democratically there is a need for multilingualism and good language services , due attention should be paid to the smooth running and effective functioning of the linguistic service .
It requires continual development .
In future , we also need to establish various indicators to provide a basis for analysing the action taken .
They have to take decisions on issues which are more complicated than ever .
As it has been possible to maintain rigour in parliamentary expenditure , particularly as a result of good building policy , there would seem to be a good deal of room for manoeuvre at present : anything up to EUR 90 million .
Because there is a surplus from last year , it is impossible at this stage to predict what the actual needs will be .
It will be unnecessary to increase the Parliament’s budget unless there are genuine reasons for doing so .
I have three general points .
I am very happy that the Member States have taken the issue forward .
The second point I wanted to make is that I think an external relations service for all of us will bring only benefits .
In many ways , this whole issue has only winners .
Because , as we all know , without a functioning civil service on a European level , it cannot work .
To finish off , I would like to say to the Commission that I hope they stay very firm to the end , because we have to avoid the counter-contamination of issues such as trade and development going over to the intergovernmental and Council side .
Connected with that is a respect for one’s native language .
Culture is language-bound and language is culture-bound .
Certain events in the region of Mari El , in Russia , have caused us , as Finno-Ugric linguistic relatives of the Mari people , to focus our attention on the status of minorities and minority languages in Russia .
Democracy is not just about voting .
This will increase Russia’s credibility as a state subject to the rule of law .
These representatives of the Finno-Ugric nations in Russia are , however , spread over many regions in a large country .
Cultural and linguistic diversity is a source of immense wealth in Russia , and we hope that it will be exploited better than it is now , and more than it is now .     .
Madam President , as a fan of Liverpool football club I must say that I was happy to come over here after the first half , because AC Milan is currently 30 ahead in the Champions ’ League final .
First , I welcome the Commission ’s proposal .
In my mind that would amount to giving a blank cheque .
Perhaps that is something you could rectify at second reading , Commissioner .
I think the proposal is sound , especially in the light of the European Parliament’s amendments .     .
Madam President , for the Italian and the English booths : the match is now 33 , with about ten minutes to go .
I have three points .
I wish to focus especially on Article 4 , which is one of the most illiberal proposals to pass through this House .
I have quite a lot of faith in the individual to be able to make his or her own decisions on what food should or should not be eaten .
My second point is that I believe diets themselves are more important than the nutrient profiles of individual foods .
Different people have different dietary needs , just as Mrs Niebler told us earlier .
However , I cannot support needless legislation or the assumption that people do not understand what is said on the label .
We know that almost half the current EU budget is used for this purpose .
It has been difficult to administer the fund .
As the intention is to establish just one administration and inspection system for both funds , administration will be simplified and made more efficient .
We know , after all , that the present bureaucratic and ineffective system of administration tends to aggravate the situation .
The committee , however , made the deadlines shorter again .
It makes essential remarks on where European decision-makers need to concentrate their efforts in the coming years .
Last week’s elections in Germany and the forthcoming referendum in France are sending strong signals that voters are unhappy with their governments ’ handling of the economy .
Collective wage negotiations should be reformed to take greater account of productivity growth .
The entry of women into the job market also needs to be enhanced .
We must continue to emphasise the importance of reducing unemployment by strengthening growth and increasing investment and competition , the level of service and the range of choices available to citizens .
We must not allow our stagnating rules and practices to hinder those who are willing to work from entering or staying in the labour market .
