thoughts coming from those people who also demand the internalisation of external costs , i .e . the inclusion of decommissioning costs in the overall cost structure , when the procedure now put before us is pretty much the same thing .
I support the proposal for a trialogue .
It seems the sensible approach .
The work must be done and has to be paid for somehow .
I am very sorry to hear colleagues propagating ancient myths like " no solution has been found for dealing with nuclear waste " .
I am afraid Mrs Ahern has lost contact with the facts in this matter because she is quite wrong in her statement , and we should not let such myths distract us from the issue at hand .
Madam President , I am delighted to at least have the opportunity of contributing to this debate on behalf of the PPE , and firstly to congratulate Mr Berenguer Fuster for the work that he has done in relation to this report .
I recognise that his report is quite brief , but that belies the amount of work that has had to be undertaken because the issue that we are considering is a complex one as he made clear in the course of his remarks .
We are dealing in essence with the compromise between access to confidential information , information which comes into the hands of a whole range of regulatory authorities , and the use that is subsequently made of that information .
We know that the information is in general gathered as a result of the obligations that rest with companies from the whole of the inspection regime .
We have a range of regulators now , across the whole of the European Union , but we very often have a whole range of regulators within Member States themselves , and the dilemma of how information is in fact used is one that is not just a dilemma for the Community and its exchange of information with regulators beyond the Community itself .
We often have that dilemma within Member States .
I certainly have had first-hand experience of government in the United Kingdom where I can remember very many instances where the government has been on the point of granting a contract to a particular company only to find out that another branch of government is actually engaged in starting legal proceedings for one reason or another against that very company .
This is often described as the left arm of government not knowing what the right arm is doing , but what it is really about is the willingness on the part of the regulatory authorities within Member States , but also within the European Union and beyond , to exchange information whilst at the same time respecting confidentiality .
That brings me to the second brief point that I wish to make this evening which is about the need for the consolidation of regulatory authorities themselves .
That is a process that has been undertaken within the United Kingdom .
Recently , Howard Davies , who heads the new Financial Services Authority in the UK, was speaking to our Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee and outlining what that experience has been .
It has not been a wholly easy experience , but I think that people are broadly of the view that the consolidation of regulatory authorities within the United Kingdom has been a success .
It is something that could be commended to other authorities within the European Union , not least because it would lead to a common approach to the use of the information that is made available by this process , to the advantage of investors throughout the whole of the European Union itself .
Madam President , on behalf of the PPE-DE Group , I would like to very much welcome Mr Beysen 's report and also to thank him for the very clear and concise way he has presented the text .
We entirely support his proposal to push this through without any amendments .
Why are we supporting this so strongly ?
Anything in today 's world that is going to simplify life for businesses without , as Mr Beysen points out , affecting some of the key business statistical information they need to plan their businesses has to be welcome .
As someone who has founded and started small businesses himself , it is a very frustrating thing when you are trying to manage a business to be asked to fill in statistical returns , taking resources from your business that you could well be using on developing new sales and moving your business forward .
Reading Mr Beysen 's report , the history of this proposal is rather depressing .
I was not in the last Parliament , and it is clear that Parliament has put a lot of work into this , but it has taken three years to get to the point where we are now .
It may well be that Mr Beysen 's report hides a deceptively complex set of variables that the Commission has had to deal with .
Nevertheless , it seems to me that if we are going to make serious progress on slimming down legislation , making the environment for small businesses better - and that after all is an aim of the Lisbon Summit , we have seen that - we must get better at approaching these sort of projects .
So , I would like you to assure us this evening that you are making a serious effort to move more quickly in this area ; and also , given the benefits of new technology moving forward in this area , with many more business-to-business transactions being handled electronically , more business-to-government transactions being handled electronically , that you are planning to exploit that technology in such a way that statistics can in future be collected automatically .
