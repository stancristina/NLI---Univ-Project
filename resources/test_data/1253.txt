We are therefore being asked to approve a deterioration of conditions of movement for the inhabitants of Kaliningrad or those who go there .
It must also be said that the Buitenweg report in no way seeks to make short work of the issue of decriminalising drugs , even soft drugs , but addresses solely and exclusively two issues : the effectiveness and relevance of the current system and the need to reclassify substances .
This could be an opportunity to open a broad debate on the matter .
Allow me also to express extreme concern over the current trend where several countries of the Union are hardening their migration policies .
As certain Members are saying , it is true that this directive is better than nothing when we know of the difficulties encountered to reach this point .
Yet the principle of the right to live as a family is simple .
But who is going to decide whether the fact that they have no other means of support is legally significant ?
Mr President , the report contains proposals which , if they were binding , might go some way towards reducing the difficulties that we are experiencing with family reunification .
As for the Council , there is a risk that they will let the text go through because they will all say - as they do all too often : 'the essential points are safe for the time being and as for the rest we will see in two years ' time ' .
But economic policy cannot be restricted solely to combating public deficits .
Costa Rica is a country that is developing relatively well .
That being said , and to respond to the concerns that have been expressed both by several Members of Parliament and by some of our Member States , as well as by some traders and , obviously , by the countries in question , the Commission has agreed to show a degree of flexibility .
Would a specific derogation for agricultural products be welcome ?
In this respect , I can say that the Commission is insisting that the candidate countries take their commitment to police these borders seriously and that the Council working group tasked with assessing border controls and the centre for land borders , based in Germany , are monitoring all issues relating to the future external land border very carefully , and that includes the Slovak green border , but also the Polish green border , which is quite extensive .
Explain to me what a collective expulsion is , that is what is forbidden .
Indeed this text constitutes the first directive on legal immigration since competence for this area moved to European level .
That is why I would ask Parliament to show understanding for the fact that the Commission itself is not going to move away from this political agreement either .
If the European Union has to have a common immigration and asylum policy and has to provide itself with the means to manage migratory flows , this policy should respect the human rights and fundamental freedoms that are universally recognised and acknowledged by the Member States .
This is a major and complex issue with a great deal at stake in the long term and our democracies have an important responsibility to assume for it .
In rejecting a Community policy so as to meet the national demands of the Member States , in putting the rights of migrants and their families at risk , thus handing them over to the violence of deportation , and in refusing to recognise the wealth that these citizens , whether legal or not , bring to the project of European integration , this proposal is based on a philosophy that runs counter to our conviction that Europe should be a place of openness and solidarity , and that is why the Group of the Greens rejects it .
This causes us to reflect for a moment , as Mr Bayona invites us to do , on the link between information and citizenship , in particular with a view to next year 's elections .
The Commission would have appreciated being given advance warning of this state of affairs at a prior meeting with the competent authorities in Parliament , as befits the spirit of interinstitutional cooperation that should prevail in the running of the Prince programme .
But to be effective , it is vital for a majority of Member States to follow the example of the coordinated approach adopted by the institutions .
We should ask ourselves whether the outcome really is a consensual one .
We should take account of these questions when it comes to the main items on the agenda for 2004 , namely enlargement , the new treaty and the European elections .
I cannot fully subscribe to Commissioner Verheugen 's proposals on this .
It would be sheer folly to believe a Council of 25 members could ever reach unanimous agreement .
Parliament was certainly entitled to demand the reestablishment of those prerogatives that had been somewhat limited .
We have therefore arrived at the decision we will take today , that will allow us to heal the old scars .
I would like to take advantage of my last speech as rapporteur to thank my colleagues on the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy and the joint parliamentary delegation , who have provided me with a great deal of support over the years .
Its cultural and economic contribution is irrefutable and will be further increased considerably when sustainable peace is achieved in the Middle East .
It should be made clear that these clauses create an additional safety net .
Warsaw has forgotten Europe 's memories .
The people of Europe
