on the basis of race and ethnic origin , and we recently organised a major conference on this issue .
We intend to keep pushing the process forward , through the Structural Funds , the Research Framework Programme , the European Employment Strategy , the new EQUAL Initiative and the new Social Action Programme which we hope to adopt in the summer .
We intend to use all these instruments to fight discrimination and , as you know , work has also started on the European Charter of Fundamental Rights .
Parliament has a key role to play in this regard .
It is vital for the Commission that the Parliament contributes to the growing momentum surrounding these proposals by delivering its opinions on the package as soon as possible , and by participating fully in the work of drafting the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
I will conclude as I have started : the Charter will represent the high priority that the Union as a whole accords to the fight against racism and discrimination and to protection of human rights .
I sincerely hope that , during our debate on this issue next year , we will be congratulating ourselves on achieving , with the Charter , a new tool to fight against racism and xenophobia in the Union .
The purpose of the Dublin Convention and Eurodac is to allocate to a single Member State responsibility for examining an asylum application , and the justification for the proposed regulation is that there is a need to extend fingerprinting to certain categories of illegal immigrants on the grounds that a substantial number of them will have claimed asylum previously or intend to do so .
The problem is that some have not and will not , so this means that the proposed regulation goes beyond the strict terms of Dublin by guessing at or anticipating the existence of an asylum application .
Thus the Dublin Convention is , in the words of the UK House of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities , a shaky edifice on which to construct a system for taking and exchanging fingerprint data on those who have not yet made or may not make an asylum application .
This is a legally uncertain basis for legislation and that makes me unhappy .
There is also an absence of clarity in the definition of the illegal immigrants to whom the regulation will apply .
Member States are required to fingerprint every third-country national over 14 who is apprehended in connection with the irregular crossing of their border - that is not very precise .
Fingerprinting is a serious invasion of privacy and the compatibility of such requirements with the European Convention on Human Rights needs to be carefully weighed .
I am not sure that this has really been done .
There are also data protection worries , which is why Parliament wanted to extend the provisions on erasing data to include , for instance , those who obtain any kind of legal status to remain in a Member State even if not full refugee status .
I am glad to see the amended proposal takes up Parliament 's demand to erase the data when an individual has got a subsidiary or temporary form of protection , but could I enquire whether this would cover for example - in the system I know best - the UK 's exceptional leave to remain ?
Finally , Mr President , whatever the justification for widening the Eurodac fingerprinting system to some categories of illegal immigrants , I am personally not convinced that this proposal is legally watertight .
Are the Council and the Commission so convinced ?
Mr President , we are dealing here with amendments to a directive concerning the intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine .
I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on his report and agreeing very strongly with the remarks he has just made .
I suggested a single amendment during the committee stage of the debate , which was accepted by the committee , regarding the need for Member States to put in place a proper system of spot checks , inspections and controls to ensure the efficient implementation of these regulations .
My amendment calls upon the Commission to monitor the Member States to see that they carry out the necessary inspections set out in these regulations , because if we are to mount a successful campaign to contain and eradicate tuberculosis and brucellosis , then the proper implementation of these regulations will be essential .
May I also say that , sadly , these regulations are at the present time largely academic in respect of my own Member State because of course we have been banned from exporting live bovine animals from the UK for the past four years .
Indeed , even the export of dead bovines is still being blocked in certain countries because although the ban on the export of beef from the UK was lifted on 1 August 1999 , it is , as we all know , still being illegally maintained by France and Germany to this very day .
In the case of the pig sector the export trade is also suffering because during the past two years the pig industry has experienced acute difficulties .
Indeed in Scotland , my own country , we have witnessed a 25 % reduction in the national herd in the past twelve months .
Unless urgent action is taken by the UK Government , a further 25 % will go within the next few months .
Now , this appalling situation has been brought about by a combination of issues involving the strength of sterling , the gold-plating of welfare and hygiene standards , which have been imposed on the industry by the UK Government , and the extra costs arising out of the BSE crisis
