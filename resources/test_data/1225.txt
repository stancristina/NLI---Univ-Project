Mr President , as a representative of the Group of the European People ' s Party and European Democrats , which is Christian Democratic in character , I wish to express our deep and sincere sympathy with all the victims of the terrible earthquake in Turkey .
The events in Turkey highlight the need , at international level too , for some form of emergency force to respond to appalling natural disasters of this kind .
Allow me to thank you for your contribution to the new procedure we have now brought about .
I believe that , as early as in a week or so , Parliament ' s different committees will enter into discussions with relevant members of the Commission .
I wonder if you can say something about those matters .
The one strategy prioritised cutting-edge technologies , research-based innovations , e-commerce , the liberalisation of network markets and such like .
The second strategy prioritised full employment , social integration and education for all , instead .
I think that , as rapporteur , Mr Bullmann has really endeavoured for as long as possible to preserve unity and the policy of compromise on socio-economic matters .
We should not do that with any pleasure , but there are limits .
There are only a few years left before enlargement , and it is high time that we began to face that reality head on .
I also wish to state that the previous summit - the Spring Summit in Stockholm - was a success .
I therefore have nothing against liberalisation as such , but it must be balanced against a vigorous employment strategy , quality of employment , the fight against poverty and , in particular , efforts towards sustainable development .
It must not just be about liberalisation .
It is now high time that we provided stronger support for developing and consolidating the process of modernising the European economy and that we made clear our demands for practical measures .
What is fundamental to achieving the Lisbon objective is , first of all , an internal energy market characterised by liberalisation , competition and openness .
Small and medium-sized enterprises , in particular , must also be provided with sound basic conditions in which to start up , grow and become larger - or , perhaps , even to become large companies .
If the report were really to have supported the Lisbon process , it should have focused upon deregulation , liberalisation and increased competition .
Over the last 40 years , as many as 23 political parties have been declared illegal in Turkey .
These have been parties with religious , regional , cultural and ethnic bases which have been considered to go against the Kemalist structure of the unitary state .
I promise that we in the European Parliament will show no lack of vigour , energy and persistence in monitoring this judicial process in Turkey .
My view is that the Kemalist unitary state is based more upon power , threats , compulsion and authoritarian demands for loyalty than upon winning over people ' s hearts and inspiring an inner loyalty , healthy affection and patriotism in relation to their own country .
I wonder if Turkey is not in actual fact scoring an own goal by not opening itself to the outside world and not acting differently towards its minorities .
At the same time , it is a region that easily causes even its best friends to despair .
Instead , widespread corruption flourishes , based on clan loyalties and mafia domination .
Unfortunately , there are no clear signs of solutions to the conflicts concerning , for example , Nagorno-Karabakh , South Ossetia or Abkhazia .
The risks are not reduced by the fact that the area is a transport route for the Caspian Sea ' s and Central Asia ' s gas and oil field and is situated in the vicinity of Afghanistan , a factor which has led to reports to the effect that Al-Qaida members may be found in the border country between Georgia and Russia .
A civil peace corps could constitute a tool for such an action plan , designed to prevent conflicts .
The nuclear power station in Medzamor must , as agreed , be shut down by no later than 2004 .
This has partly happened because the three states are members of the Council of Europe .
I would particularly advise against approving Amendment No 2 because such approval would mean a sudden U-turn , unsubstantiated by new arguments , in relation to the position held by the European Parliament since 1987 .
I am conscious of the fact that there are Armenian circles that try to exploit the events of 1915 to excuse today ' s Armenian politics .
That does not , however , mean that history has to be re-written .
Those who recognise this and openly come to terms with their pasts command respect , while those which deny and conceal their pasts mostly evoke surprise and disappointment .
The EU must have a clear and well thought-out policy for a region as important as this on the border between Europe and Asia .
It has an important task in terms of strengthening the democratic forces and civil society and combating the environmental problems .
At the same time , those of us who are dependent upon both passenger and freight transport must be entitled to communicate without such communication ' s damaging public health through air pollution and noise .
I would also call upon the Commission to do the same .
These are concepts we must make use of when we draw up our policy .
, in writing .
It was a laudable attempt to bring about a social compromise , but it has not been implemented in actual policy , and it is now ever clearer that certain governments and political
