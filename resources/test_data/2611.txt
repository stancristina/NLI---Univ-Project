and that is what we want .
I would like to assure him of my full support .
So instead of bans , let us take a different attitude , a more difficult , more determined , more modest one , too : one of educating the youth in our countries .
Secondly , as regards the substance , it is not acceptable to ban the advertisement of a product which is freely available for sale and which , moreover , is authorized and financed by the European Union .
But that is another story .
Furthermore , the Director-General of the WHO indicated , at the time of the publication of their annual report , that the fight against tobacco addiction was one of the main priorities of the World Health Organization .
It has proved effective .
All surveys made of young people show that there has been a considerable increase in awareness about the risks and the need for behavioural change .
It represents a refusal of law .
They want to lay the foundations of a truly European immunity , which would succeed in creating equality amongst its Members , whatever their nationality .
That is to be welcomed .
The market must stop where life , which is sacred , begins !
I am very pleased about this .
In conclusion , Mr President , I would simply like to note that the cost of this measure for some countries which have lead piping in use within their water distribution networks has to be carefully considered .
I consequently entreat the Commission to support this amendment and we will thus be voting for a directive which is clearly an improvement on the previous one .
This severity leads to a danger of seeing these standards reduced .
If a deadline of 1999 is set when we are already halfway through 1998 , I think the timescale is too short and that this will be detrimental to the economy .
Indeed , at a time when the youth and education programmes are coming to an end , it is necessary not only to be able to evaluate them , but also to give a new direction to their actions according to previously agreed central themes .
It is vital to the future of the European Union to preserve and expand these proven programmes , despite a low level of funding .
I would like to consider three issues : firstly , a rapid account of the developments and progress of the last three years on this subject ; secondly , the timetable within which our current reflections fit ; and thirdly , issues relating to the structure and content , management and financing of Community actions .
They will give an opinion , in particular , on the content and structure of the programmes , on the revitalization of the way in which they are managed and on the levels of funding .
If you are in agreement , I would like to return for a moment to the Commission 's language policy which has been mentioned by several of you .
I know how concerned you are to see that a better coordination and a better synergy with the Structural Funds is assured and to develop deeper relations between European programmes on professional training and the European Social Fund and I am fully in agreement with this direction .
It is through an understanding of the way of life , the way of working , in other countries of the Union ; it is through the exchange of what we call good practice ; it is through a knowledge of languages that the European dream will come closer .
Madam President , I would just like to point out that my vote on the first amendment , which is No 26 , in the Rothley recommendation , was not recorded .
They all believe that the European Parliament is the institution to which they are accountable for their activities , to which they must explain and declare their intentions and announce their opinions on various subjects .
In fact , I cannot see why the Peter Principle should apply to such an institution .
Price stability , the main aim attributed to the European Central Bank , was achieved by reducing the creation of money and credit , to encourage better returns on investment .
We hope that today 's debate will not provide an opportunity for that .
Then there is this Parliament 's power of consultation .
For the sake of peace and for Europe , I very much hope that it can be put into practice and that it will be successful .
The area in question is a sensitive area in terms of stability and peace and it is also a vast commercial area .
Indeed , given that this zone will be economically heterogeneous , given that it will also be psychologically heterogeneous , as there will be no massive united support by public opinion in Europe for the Central Bank , it will constantly have to face divergences far stronger those within a national State .
The squabbling between Member States has relegated the birth of the euro to second place and has diminished its importance as an event .
Furthermore , note that the 'independence ' of the ECB remains unclear and vague .
We have no authority to decide , which shows the small extent of our power , and the contrasting large extent of the European Central Bank 's .
In that respect , we approve the regulation of the advertising and promotion of tobacco .
But , in practice , in order to achieve the required aims , clear , relevant and measurable parameters must be defined .
Any attempt to establish standards relating to the quality of water intended for human consumption will be futile if cooperation between Member States is not ensured
