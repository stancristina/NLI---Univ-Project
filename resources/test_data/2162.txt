Food Authority into a success .
Only when it transpired that people can contract fatal illnesses from contaminated food , did an increasing number of people want to know what they were eating .
After all , the question of EFA' s location cannot be seen in isolation from the as yet unresolved issue of the EP ' s location and the ludicrous shuttle between Brussels and Strasbourg .
They involve outsiders in low-wage countries or sell vulnerable parts of their enterprise to the staff or management .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is a pleasure for me to be meeting you here again in order to shed light on the salient points of the second reading of the EU' s draft general budget , as drawn up on 22 November .
In our jargon , this means that the geographically oriented budget items are increased , and by these we mean the items for Asia and TACIS of the external policy .
In the framework of the agreement with the European Parliament on an amount of EUR 20 million in commitment appropriations under Heading 3 for those border regions , the Council has approved the trial project : 'Effects of enlargement in the border regions ' .
I am delighted that an agreement has been reached in the framework of the joint declaration on the management of the commitments outstanding ( the RALs ) and of the elimination in the medium term of what people started to refer to as 'abnormal RALs ' .
Furthermore , an implementation plan for the 2002 per heading of the financial perspectives will be sent upon submittal of the preliminary draft budget for 2003 .
As far as agricultural expenditure is concerned , letter of amendment 2 has been adopted in its entirety .
As far as the external policy is concerned , the Council has not only increased the budget items covering Asia and TACIS by EUR 66 million compared to the draft budget , it has also adopted letter of amendment 2 concerning international fisheries agreements .
The total increase of payment appropriations is therefore restricted to 2 % .
Everyone has put forward their view in clear , concise , sometimes lengthy , yet forceful terms .
At the start of the budgetary procedure , it looked as if the pain for the 2002 budget was mainly concentrated in heading 5 .
It did occur to me to break up the cycle and to simply leave a number of Council cutbacks in heading 5 where they are , including the cutback at the Court of Justice .
Another bizarre aspect of the budgetary procedure is the implementation of the budget , and we as Parliament are also guilty of making empty promises .
And you cannot get much closer than the people of Elsene , our neighbours in Brussels , and I am therefore delighted with the paragraph in the present resolution which urges us to draw up a sound inventory of what we need , and how we can provide for it , and also to take account of the interests of the citizens in the immediate vicinity , before we start making plans for new Parliament buildings .
I really fail to understand how the Council dares present proposals of this kind .
In my opinion , we have made a rather considerable concession with regard to payments .
Another point which causes great concern , in my view , is the Council ' s attitude towards projects which could improve employment .
In this respect , the recent crisis in agriculture springs to mind in the first instance .
Will we once again have to fiddle with the ceilings agreed in Berlin ?
Thank you , Mr President .
Of great concern is still the fact that a large number of amendments are left over , of which the Commission had said before that it was unable or not prepared to implement them .
You will be submitting a proposal after the Green Paper consultation in the course of 2002 or at the end of 2002 or beginning of 2003 , this will be followed by a Treaty amendment in 2004 , and entry into force is likely in 2006-2007 .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the World Trade Organisation has a future .
We must continue to strive as we have for over fifty years .
Direct income support , and a widening of the agricultural packages of tasks and rewards are positive steps towards that goal .
Thank you , Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen .
As at previous WTO conferences , the liberalisation of the economy was also mentioned at Doha .
I do , however , support the promotion of health in the candidate countries where even basic health care is below standard .
Thank you , Madam President .
One could sum this up by saying that catalytic converters will be compulsory in 2006 .
We had focused primarily on the interim evaluation of Tampere , of the decisions and recommendations made there , and on the four priorities which we had chosen for our presidency , namely the conversion from pro-Eurojust to Eurojust ; the fight against trafficking in human beings , not only by standardising the laws but also operationally in the field ; the fight against the disappearance of children ; and last but not least , the freezing of assets .
I would like to illustrate this issue on the basis of two topical examples which I know have been the subject of intense discussion in your Parliament .
The obligation to honour these rights as set out in Article 6 of the Treaty has been added , as has the work we have done on the European arrest warrant .
