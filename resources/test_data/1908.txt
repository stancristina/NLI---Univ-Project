would wait for the conclusions of the work currently being carried out by the Italian judiciary before firing accusations or making scathing judgments about the work of the Italian police force .
However , partly due to the attention that the movement has succeeded in drawing to these summits , it would be almost impossible to avoid addressing the role of the poorest countries and undertaking more convincing action with regard to the issues of debt , poverty , trade , the fight against disease and the environment .
Never more so than at Genoa has it been clear that similar displays of muscle and power on the part of the world ' s greatest nations are just cinema which certainly does nothing to alleviate hunger in the world or to enhance equality between peoples if it is not matched by practical action to cancel the debt , redistribute wealth , safeguard material rights and eliminate all exploitation of developing countries .
Madam President , the Minister began her speech by talking about her generation .
In Italy , the Courts are already hard at work , as is the parliamentary committee of inquiry .
In Genoa , then , the Genoa Social Forum - that is , a thousand or so organisations , all of them peaceful and non-violent , half of them Italian - called on 300 000 people to come together and express their dissent and their alternative goals .
Right-wing authoritarian processes have a history in Europe !
Minister , you have said that Europe can be a model in facing the problems of tomorrow ' s globalisation .
If we want Europe to respond to the concerns of globalisation , let us move ahead on the road towards building a political Union and giving Europe a single voice .
To achieve this outcome , they use the European Parliament , organising in Parliament , as they did yesterday , for example , meetings with exponents of antiglobalisation movements that spread ridiculous , false accusations and offend a European Union Member State by calling it an incomplete democracy that should be placed under supervision .
We also here express our utter condemnation of the mindless violence by some groups of demonstrators and our severe criticism of those organisers who reject violence in words but who were unable or unwilling , in fact , to break off all relations with those in the movement who preached or advocated violence .
Violence is rejected without equivocation .
On the first point , the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights accepted the European Commission ' s desire not to grant the kind of carte blanche or blank cheque that some countries in the Union would have liked , to be able to intercept and access European Union citizens ' personal data , for instance by accessing data collected by telephone companies .
Furthermore , the costs that the consumer has to bear are set to fall with the liberalisation of telecommunications that the Commission is pressing for in the other directives in the package .
I told him I would ask the President-in-Office of the Council , mentioning what he had told me , and that then I would give him the answer .
In other respects , however , the Cappato report reduces the protection of citizens ' privacy offered by the draft directive , particularly where we have legislative competence .
In an amusing article , an Italian journalist wrote : ' I thought I had bought a little telephone , but found myself with a tamagochi , that Japanese toy that needs looking after like a baby .
If the procedure has been violated , the work in violation of the procedure should be cancelled ; if the procedure has been respected , it has been respected .
I believe this is the least we owe to the House .
The alternative would have been to create a mammoth , over-bureaucratised structure in its directorate general , all the more so , of course , with the prospect of enlargement .
I would like to thank Mr Evans personally for his consideration for the Commission , his commitment in dealing with this issue and the high quality of his report .
I keenly appreciate , therefore , the fact that Mr Evans fully and firmly supports the Commission ' s proposal contained in Article 3 , aimed at making Community competition law the only set of rules to be applied in cases where trade between Member States might be prejudiced .
That makes me extremely worried about the amendment to extend duty of secrecy to in-house lawyers .
If the communications between in-house lawyers and other employees became confidential , the Commission ' s powers to apply the standards would be seriously compromised .
The Commission recognises that under certain circumstances there may be a legitimate requirement for clarification in relation to an individual case , and that the guidelines , guiding principles and existing case law do not always provide answers .
My impression is that the proposed system for formulating opinions would be favourably received by the business world .
The proposed powers will allow the Commission to protect the public interest in the effective and consistent implementation of the rules , by drawing the attention of the courts to important points relating to their interpretation and implementation .
Perhaps there ought to be superior delivery of information to encourage the members to make better use of the opportunities available .
The Community budget is protected as regards loans granted to third countries by the Guarantee Fund Mechanism .
That is why I think the Ombudsman is right to propose amending Article 3 of the statute , which dates from the 1990s .
We are working together , of course , and we too are working for the citizens of Europe , because they have a champion in this Parliament , the most authoritative institution in that respect .
