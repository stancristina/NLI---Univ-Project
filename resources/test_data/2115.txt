We and the workers are calling for a reduction in the retirement age and working life , for pension funds to be financed from the national budget and for an increase in employers ' contributions , coupled with a reduction in employees ' contributions .
The principle that a large financial market offers greater liquidity and greater economic weight is well known .
The Commission proposal is based on the unification of the financial markets , on the so-called ' European passport ' ; in other words , it offers investment banks the right to develop their activities in all 15 Member States , provided they comply with the rules of approval in just one Member State rather than in 15 .
The interests are fluid at the moment , because technology and the concentration of banking capital in large enterprises are creating new conditions , conditions under which banks are turning into stock exchanges with internal transactions and the stock exchanges are turning from infrastructures into companies .
Thus , there is a risk of multiple fragmentation of the market which the directive , in one of its most controversial provisions , is trying to overcome , by forcing investment banks to communicate with the market transparently and before and after their commercial transactions are closed .
I hope that this conciliatory approach will prevail until the end and that the amendments proposed by our group will be supported , so that the report can be approved by a large majority .
That is why , with the work of the Convention , the constitutional history of the European Union has started to unroll .
If , on the contrary , the Intergovernmental Conference distances itself politically from the draft , it will damage our institutional victory and the result of the revision will not , I fear , differ from the Nice fiasco .
For example : first , the institution of the President of the European Council does not leave the balance between the institutions or the functioning of the European Commission or the parity between the states untouched .
Thirdly , it proved impossible to take substantial steps on a foreign policy and security policy which would allow the European Union to restore its political credibility internationally .
First reason : constitutional texts are not static .
Third reason : we are not calling on the European citizens to support the constitutional text because they will be ignorant of its drawbacks , but in knowledge of its drawbacks and for reasons of its advantages .
That is why I am voting against urging that the Intergovernmental Conference safeguard it constitutionally .
That is what was so badly damaged by the alliance between certain of its members and the United States , who must bear the burden of the illegal invasion of Iraq on the pretext of terrorism .
One of these is the reform process .
Secondly , we cannot proceed with the budget as it is being configured today .
Where is the cohesion of the eurozone , the symmetry between economic and monetary policy , to come from ?
My honourable friend Mr Cossutta said as much , I shall not repeat him .
Allow me to comment on one last issue , the reference to religions .
Or even of anti-clericalism , which inspired the Enlightenment , which inspired revolutions and intellectuals and policies in Europe .
Let us allow our citizens a pluralistic choice for their future lives and careers .
He referred to the substance .
The fact that only the members of the European United Left ( 45 ) voted in favour of these amendments , while 420 voted against and 68 abstained , demonstrates just how hypocritical they all are ; while they are making a great show of fighting for the rights of the Iraqi people , they bless its occupation , oppression and plundering in practice .
The European Union will thus follow the path of support for the behemoths taken by the USA .
Adopting it signals the de jure acceptance of the demands of the widespread 'patent industry ' in the USA , will discourage research and development and will result in a huge waste of resources on legal protection proceedings which could have been invested in technological innovation .
Professor Tsatsos has interesting , valuable , progressive views on the constitutional venture of the European Union .
Thus , despite the useful ideas in the motion on issues such as the role of the European Parliament and the national parliaments , the development of social policy or referenda , I abstained from the final vote .
The institutionalisation of the market economy , the further militarisation of the ?U , in cooperation with ? ? ? ? , which goes as far as preventive intervention on the pretext of terrorist threat , the redistribution of power for the benefit of the powerful and the even greater transfer of national sovereignty to the international centre are just some of the 'gifts ' which the Intergovernmental Conference is to offer the monopolies .
It trusts in the fight of the peoples , which will demolish the construction of the exploiters and radically change society .
What we are or are not debating today is immaterial in relation to what must be done there .
We here are a political body .
We are talking about one roadmap in relation to what is happening in the area and we fail to see the other roadmap , the map of violence , of blood , of suicides , of innocent people murdered and so on , of the wall , of anything else .
We must send out certain positive messages .
I therefore agree with the proposal made by my honourable friend Mr Poettering for international blue-helmeted observers to be installed at long last on the border between the two states , as has happened elsewhere in the world .
Madam President
