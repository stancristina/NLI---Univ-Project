advantageous tax conditions , for instance , are useful because they can contribute positively to the cohesion policies and because , in the absence of any tax harmonisation among the Member States , they constitute a vital instrument in the hands of national governments where tackling regional underdevelopment is concerned .
Through this institution , I therefore call for greater compliance with Community law and with its general principles of freedom and proportionality , through strict monitoring of customs procedures .
The first point that I should like to address concerns the European Parliament .
I also believe that the clause should be applied in relation to the violation under discussion and not in relation to the country under discussion .
It is also necessary to extend the clause to all new agreements between the European Union and third countries , both industrialised and developing , including sectoral agreements and commercial , technical or financial aid , along the lines of what has been done for the ACP countries .
This resolution recognises that the need for unanimity within the Council in order to initiate a consultation procedure has made it more difficult to apply the clause .
That reveals the obvious need for a legislative provision , without which the sector cannot grow – something that was also acknowledged by the Commission in its report on energy efficiency .
Indeed , accepting the principle of protecting human rights was a great step forwards .
This problem has not been solved even by this report .     – Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , a huge demonstration today in Strasbourg has told us loud and clear that there is a need for a different Europe .
That is why we shall vote against this directive and this poor compromise .     – Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we are and always have been against the directive , even in its amended version .
What remains of the directive is a pastiche , the outcome of the rationale that compromise should be taken to the extreme , lumping together views that cannot coexist , namely unbridled liberalisation and protection for the corporate privileges of certain categories and sectors .
In conclusion , I call for the body to monitor   …     – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe we are all absolutely convinced of the need to complete the internal market in services , by eliminating barriers , restrictive practices and protectionism .
Those sectors include professional activities , banking , financial and insurance services , and energy supplies .
Unfortunately , the Prodi Commission ’s proposal incorporated neither the reasoning nor the content that made Parliament have to rewrite the two directives , just as today we are being forced to rewrite the directive we are examining .
It is no coincidence that even today a large European trade union demonstration has been vehemently pointing out that , for the sake of the European labour market , Europe needs to have a services directive that completes the internal market without damaging social cohesion .
I should like , however , to comment on what has been happening within the political groups over the last year and a half , and above all in the last few weeks , as well as this afternoon and evening here in this Chamber .
As mediators , we have a duty to balance the demands for liberalisation of the market with the rights of the weaker sections of society .
Amendments 17 and 80 also propose again to exclude games of chance .
Over a billion people in the world live in extreme poverty , surviving on less than a dollar a day .
The best intelligence agencies today do not have a single reliable source in Iran capable of providing information on Tehran’s intentions and capabilities .
While it may not be perfect , the IAEA is the only means of monitoring any nuclear programme in Iran .
This also means that our American friends must change the political paradigm with Iran , acknowledging that their past approaches have been ineffective and that they need to adopt a more collaborative policy in order to safeguard everybody’s interests in this crucial part of the world .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we need to put a stop to the activity of uranium enrichment , which lacks sufficient transparency .
We need to explain that it will not be possible to pursue a dialogue between our Parliament and the Iranian Government if the latter does not establish an equivalent parliamentary delegation .
Iran and President Ahmadinejad are not the same , either .
We have appealed to the Security Council on many occasions .
The European Union must adopt determined positions in order to avoid creating an explosive situation in the Middle East and in Eurasia .
Therefore , the dialogue must continue and must be tightened up .
In that context , moreover , it is important to foster accompanying measures that facilitate innovation , research and development .
It is therefore crucial to diversify economic activities , to create new job opportunities in rural areas , to support local initiatives such as farmers ’ markets and to focus on high-quality and niche products , in addition , of course , to crafts .
Rather , this is the opposite of sport’s most wholesome values .
Obviously , the issue of the legality of prostitution is addressed in the Member States in very different ways .
I can therefore confidently state that the German Federal Government , on the word of its Minister of the Interior , not only assures us that it will fully cooperate , but also calls for the Council of Interior Ministers , which is due to meet in April , to examine the issue with the aim of developing an operational strategy .
