I believe that we came up with a good solution : the system will be mandatory and will cover wagons for the next two years ; it will also cover other vehicles - passenger vehicles - within ten years or so .
The two texts that are the subject of this debate , the amendment of the Directive on railway safety and the amendment of the Regulation on the European Railway Agency , are part of these measures .
The Agency will in fact have to play a crucial role in the introduction of the ERTMS system , not only by laying down the specifications of this harmonised signalling system , but also by guaranteeing the technical compatibility of fixed equipment fitted with different versions .
I have a good impression in that regard .
However , 400 kilometres in Europe means crossing borders .
The idea we pursued until a few years ago , of making trains learn to recognise more than one signalling system , was another option , but clearly that option was thwarted by the existence of more than 20 different systems in Europe .
If these two matters make sufficiently rapid headway , we will have made a real , major contribution to the eventual construction of the single railway market .
The text is clarified and three Regulations are consolidated into a single text .
Vice-President of the Commission . - ( FR ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank you sincerely for this debate and Parliament 's commitment to seeing through to completion this text , which is essential to the functioning of the single aviation market .
I am therefore delighted with the quality of the work that has been done and I think that the rapporteur has done an excellent job , with the help of the Commission and all those who participated in this debate , above all to defend passengers ' rights .
The many amendments tabled during discussion of the draft report by members of the Committee on Transport , and the helpful contributions from the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Regional Development , show how strongly the European Parliament feels about urban mobility , a subject which affects the overwhelming majority of EU citizens .
I welcome most of the ideas set out in the text , but I should like to dwell in particular on a few specific points among the many covered .
That is what subsidiarity is all about .
Financial contributions are of course a possibility .
Thank you for having raised an issue that is highly topical and relates to the safety of our citizens .
Therefore , as soon as a definite answer to the question of safety has been received - in other words , what the European Aviation Safety Agency regards scientifically as the safest means of guaranteeing that children can travel by air at reduced risk - it will be my duty to propose immediately the measures needed to improve child safety devices .
As I said , as soon as I am presented with clearer facts - with a scientific response backed by evidence that enables me to act - I shall take action .
I would reiterate that I gave certain undertakings at my hearing ; to promise that legislative measures , dozens of legislative measures , will be enacted is not a viable , truthful response .
Since none of us , I believe , is an expert on the matter and can give scientifically proven answers , I think we must await the findings .
It is a directive - please may I speak for three seconds .
That statement says absolutely nothing about the role that this Union can and must play in fostering the civil and political rights of everyone living on Chinese soil , in Tibet and not just in Tibet .
( Applause ) author . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we put a simple question to 47 Members from different political groups : what are the Council and the Commission intending to do about the violations of international conventions by the Israeli authorities as regards Palestinian prisoners ?
The vast majority of prisoners are detained in Israeli territory , violating Article 76 of the Geneva Convention : arbitrary arrests , house-to-house searches , administrative detention , torture and abuse during interrogations in detention centres .
All my children , sons and daughters , are now grown up , married and have left my home .
Can a man who has been in prison for 32 years be prevented from seeing his mother ?
Would you please remind the House that I have the right to speak ? - I was saying that the Commission and the Government are going in the right direction and in particular I believe that we should not vote on a resolution that is full of inaccuracies , actual errors from a legal point of view , i .e . full of legal falsehoods .
We are not alone in highlighting these abuses : there have been loud protests from large parts of the Catholic Church , and both lay and Catholic voluntary associations and organisations .
As Strasbourg is symbolic of renewed peace , so today the European flag flies alongside the national flags , and should be a visible representation of the symbol of all citizens united by a common project for defence , security , cultural and economic growth , and the transparency of the Central Bank : perhaps that is still missing from the new Treaty .
Not just green certificates or trade but mutual growth , jointly sharing the Euro-Mediterranean project ; we must think of the pockets of terrorism in Mogadishu and the violence in Zimbabwe that are preventing the development of democracy .
I also take this opportunity to offer
