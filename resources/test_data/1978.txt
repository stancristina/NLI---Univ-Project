We must ensure that compulsory licensing is introduced .
They are also angry about the proposal you launched in February 2001 , Commissioner , in which you pulled their social charter out from under their feet with one stroke of the pen .
They are , of course , striking because if you permit self-handling in another country , you must also permit self-handling in your own country straight away because of the sacred competition rules , and that is the reason why I continue to oppose it .
So much has been said already , but this afternoon I had another meeting with some of the people from the dock workers ' unions , and I was impressed by their message .
Mr President , I naturally feel that Mr Dhaene 's appeal to some socially aware colleagues in the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats was addressed to me personally , as I am one of them .
I have now been told that the President of this Parliament may now declare these amendments admissible after all on account of a number of new elements , which Mr Bouwman has referred to .
Indeed , we have little time left in this legislative period .
The equal treatment of men and women also touches the heart of the Union 's values .
Have we not learnt anything from the report by the Court of Auditors , which said that there must be no interconnection between the groups and the political parties ?
In addition , this would make the line between donating money and buying votes a very fine one .
Negotiations are still taking place on this subject , but , as far as Parliament is concerned , adoption of the acts of accession , and the figures they contain , should not automatically signify approval of the financial perspective .
We must promote economic activity and , to that end , we must first of all create better investment opportunities in those countries , and we must look into all the means to make that possible .
We shall have to look into this .
What can we do to improve nuclear safety in the new Member States ?
We shall also have to see what the results of the extra allocation of officials have been which we have carried out in the past , et cetera .
To begin with , I am pleased that Mr Mulder is a rapporteur this year .
That means that we must do more for promotion , market orientation and the organisation of the financial policy in this field .
The accession of ten new Member States has been an important theme throughout the term of office of this Commission , and it is right that it be given top priority in 2004 .
I am talking about the NATO alliance , with the United States of America as a strong ally .
Political parties are free associations of citizens .
In the opinion of our group , it would be better to get the draft statute off the table as quickly as possible .
Should the negotiations fail , the Council would simply have the last word on revenue and Parliament on expenditure .
I think that the amendment can indeed supplement the amendment by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism that has now been approved , and that it is a more precise statement of the content of the first amendment .
- ( NL ) The ports between Hamburg in Germany and Le Havre in France , and all the Dutch and Belgian ports in-between , see the most competition of all ports .
Unfortunately , the procedure does not give us any scope to prevent this at EU level .
As I said , we are faced with a kind of economic slump .
I should now like to turn to the matter of comparisons .
This is especially the case if one part of such a country is doing well and another part is not .
On behalf of my group , I can tell you that the Commission 's new approach to the employment strategy has been received very favourably in our camp .
Therefore , a lot more work must be done towards innovation , research and development , and investment in people .
That is why we also say to the Convention that the open coordination method must be incorporated into the Constitution not only with regard to employment but also to the social process , in order to guarantee more democratic legitimacy and transparency .
Mr President , I should like to make a couple of brief remarks .
I am in agreement with the main objectives of the new employment policy and should like to call attention in particular to the second objective .
Mr President , I am disappointed by the proposals for reform of the management structure of the European Central Bank , under which different classes of member will be created and a small group of large countries will in practice make the decisions .
Initially we will be allowed to go along with this lead group , but as soon as the United Kingdom joins the euro zone we will be thanked for services rendered by being returned to the bench .
My question - it is an open question to the Commission - is whether it is not better or would be better to say in even clearer terms : 'in this ring of friends there are friends who are ever so slightly closer to us ' .
I really only have one question .
