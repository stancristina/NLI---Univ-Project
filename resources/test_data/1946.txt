On the contrary , the issues which dominated were the Middle East and past wrongdoings .
A hostile climate prevailed at the Conference , both at government level and at the level of non-government organisations .
We value their help in formulating and applying policy .
I have to say that the main , important non-governmental organisations working on racism , such as Amnesty International , Human Rights Watch and many other non-governmental organisations failed to agree and publicly fell out in an exchange of inflammatory and awkward remarks .
It sends out a clear message , as the Minister explained , about combating racism at worldwide level and , of course , every country made a commitment to national action plans , national action plans on legislation , the bases of political parties , education , employment and social and cultural life .
We cannot ascribe collective crimes to collective people , but we can condemn specific political or other leaders responsible for political mistakes .
Unfortunately , the global coalition against terrorism appears to exist alongside a xenophobic revival , as Mrs Diamantopoulou said earlier , and a tendency to demonise whole groups of people , mainly Muslims and Arabs .
During this morning ' s debate on asylum and immigration , several members in the House expressed anti-Islamic views .
These developments are most worrying .
Fighting terrorism and dispensing justice should never call our democratic achievements and respect for fundamental freedoms and human rights into question .
The European Parliament and the Council seriously disagreed on this point .
Reduced mobility does not necessary depend on some form of medical complaint .
It also states that all sloping areas in vehicles must have a non-slip surface .
Of course , we need more information on the organisation , administration and funding of the implementing agency , with integrated , realistic proposals , mainly as regards private investment .
Similarly , we must push ahead and resolve outstanding issues , by which I mean technical issues , such as incorporating EGNOS and the corresponding financial analysis and lawyers , both at Community and national level so that we can make any deliberate interference in or distortion of the system a crime and set up an authority to decide when to impose sanctions .
However , we need it not just to serve the economy , the knowledge-driven economy in today 's society , we also need it to serve the knowledge-driven and cultural society .
In fact , innovation does not depend solely or exclusively on technological factors , it also depends on organisational factors .
Europe needs an approach to innovation which will directly serve society as a whole .
We must take care to ensure that we do not just inflict talk and chalk on young people and that they take an active part in the innovative process during their studies and both inside and outside school .
We must also understand that we need better penetration of university research institutes and of scientific libraries via the Internet .
Madam President , the role played by innovation in achieving the ambitious objectives set by the European Union in Lisbon has been mentioned by the rapporteur , whom I congratulate on his detailed report , and by previous speakers .
So we need a decisive and coordinated policy which ensures that innovation penetrates our entire economic and social fabric and that our citizens ' creative powers are give free rein .
Equal opportunities should also apply geographically , given the huge discrepancies between the regions of the European Union when it comes to innovation .
Special units , such as the unit set up to manage innovative measures under Article 6 of the European Social Fund , are a step in the right direction , they just need to be adequately staffed to make them effective .
Our message of suffering for the victims should not turn into a war cry .
At the same time , in the countries of the European Union and the United States , suppressive policing measures have been stepped up in order to gag anyone who stands up against or questions their anti-grass roots policy .
No campaign of this sort and no war , at least no war in which democracies have taken part , has ever been able to create the necessary alliance of nations - because that is the alliance which counts , not the alliance of governments - without offering a vision of a better world at the end of the campaign .
The only realistic solution is to find ways of taking the tension out of social and ethnic fights , of reconciling all men of good faith , irrespective of nationality , religion , social position or ideology , in fact everyone who is determined to put an end to the scourges which inflict mankind and which , even if they do not result in terrorism , prepare the ground for terrorism and we need to remove this ground if we are to guarantee the security of our citizens .
Someone has taken my card , meaning that I cannot vote .
I think there should be quarter of an hour 's break between the end of the debate and the vote .
We all know that numerous Member States of the EU have not applied the revised ' Seveso ' directive , even though they should have been doing so since 1999 .
I should also like to point out that , according to witnesses working in the factory in question , the factory operator has not provided the public with the safety report or the emergency plans setting out action to be taken in the event of an accident , as required under the Seveso
