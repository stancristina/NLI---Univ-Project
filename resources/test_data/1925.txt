The Presidency has always wanted them to be able to present a common statement .
We think that a common statement , capable of being endorsed by the relevant Councils , was synonymous with the strongest possible political signal of what is wanted in political terms from the future strategy .
There must be no secret about there being many different points of view on how far the revision of the Employment Strategy should go .
For us , the task has therefore been to secure a common platform for further work .
A strong political signal was thus also conveyed concerning the framework and principles that the governments of the Member States believe should form the basis for preparing for the revision of the European Employment Strategy .
To begin with , it must be emphasised that the overall perspective of the Employment Strategy must be retained , with special focus upon the priorities for employment policy .
The ministers also approved the need to simplify the employment guidelines and , as far as possible , reduce their scope by having them focus upon common strategic priorities including national strategies for lifelong learning , supported by suitable objectives relating , for example , to the number of people who might be engaged in one form of education or another .
There is agreement that the strategy should concentrate more specifically on the following broad objectives : job creation and increasing labour force participation , improved quality of work , improvement and modernisation of the functioning of the labour market and the ensuring of both flexibility and job security .
To enlarge upon this , I would especially emphasise the need to increase the labour force supply via policies that promote jobs for women , older people and vulnerable groups ; by encouraging active and preventive labour market policies that are effective and efficient ; by reforming tax and benefit systems and so creating clear incentives for taking up , and remaining in , employment ; by improving lifelong learning , skills and mobility ; by increasing equality between men and women and by combating discrimination ; and by promoting developments in entrepreneurship conducive to job creation .
Finally , the Council , in expressing its support yesterday , expressed a wish for the strategy further to reflect the fact that the focus is on the medium-term challenges set out by the Lisbon strategy where , for example , the participation rates for women and older people are concerned .
In other words , they must not necessarily be changed each year .
We in the Presidency view these general principles , endorsed by the Council , as a contribution and pointer to the Commission in connection with its ongoing work as the end of the year approaches .
That is especially true when it comes to the more active involvement of the two sides of industry and of the European Parliament .
The role of the national parliaments is also to be recognised in this context .
These are crucial to monitoring the strategy and to ensuring that countries move in the desired direction and at the right time .
The purpose of such an examination must be to ensure that the indicators reflect the core objectives of the revised guidelines .
The objective must be a more efficient set of indicators , which are robust , comparable , more focused on the individual guidelines and based upon up-to-date data .
We should like to achieve a situation in which we have fewer , but better , indicators .
We must get away from the tendency to focus increasingly upon details and instruments and instead concentrate on the results to which the European Council has attached importance since the Lisbon Summit .
Over the next few years , the idea of a revised European Employment Strategy is that it should help make Europe more coherent as a continent and as a society .
In endeavouring to create ever more employment , the European Union should attach key importance to targeting and transparency , to involving a larger number of actors and to rooting employment policy more firmly in the Member States .
The methods must be put to the test in practice .
I should like to express my thanks for the many sound contributions during this debate .
I also agree that we must use this platform as the basis for a broad debate on future employment in the EU.
Let there be no doubt that the debate is open to all players and that the role of the European Parliament in this debate is absolutely crucial .
I should also like to thank Mr Bushill-Matthews for his observations to the effect that we must create jobs in practice .
I should also like to express my thanks for the many practical proposals contributed by Mr Bushill-Matthews for promoting employment in Europe and increasing flexibility in the European labour markets .
They must feel that they own the process and so feel an obligation to participate .
I think I have unfortunately to say to Mrs van den Burg that she has misunderstood the outcome of yesterday 's Council meeting .
We shall therefore try to have this endorsed at the next Council meeting .
I want to say to Mr Bouwman that we in the Council should very much like to see the various socio-political directives revised .
I should also like to thank Mr Andersson for his contribution .
We are in complete agreement on a great many matters .
We must be focused in our approach and see to it that matters are implemented in such a way that there is democratic scrutiny of all our efforts .
When all is said and done , an increase in prosperity is conditional upon those who are unemployed obtaining jobs .
New jobs must be created , and the business climate must promote
