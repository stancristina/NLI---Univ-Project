Below are the three most important points : a ) viewers need to be protected from the flood of advertisements by strengthening the binding arrangements in the directive and controlling and punishing televisions stations which infringe them ; b ) minors need general protection at Community level from advertising and from programmes which desensitise them to violence and anti-social behaviour ; and c ) stricter , specific measures are needed to promote European productions and make it easier for producers in small countries to break into the wider European market .
This , basically , is the conclusion drawn by both the Commission report and the rapporteur 's report .
Integrating the "issue of the ageing population " into national budgets is another move in the same direction .
The Member States are expressly called on to " coordinate their actions and refrain from adopting tax , budgetary or wage policies " .
However , this is of no concern to the ÅU.
State intervention does not , of course , touch the heart of the capitalist system and it often strengthens companies and businesses on a selective basis .
The competition policy applied has resulted in large branches of European industry dismissing workers and losing important shares of the global market and hundreds of thousands of jobs .
The disgraceful concentration of power , in strategically important sectors , has put the economy of entire countries in the hands of speculative multinational groups , with everything that implies for the workers .
That is why protests against globalisation and the prevalence of the uncontrolled rules of the market economy are growing day by day .
The report makes a number of good points .
More than 5 million people a year die from infectious diseases , mainly in underdeveloped countries , while a handful of multinational pharmaceutical monopolies continue to patent , profit from and speculate with drugs , even going so far as to withdraw drugs which , although they save lives , fall short of profit targets .
Health is a fundamental and inalienable human right , it is the most important factor of social justice and human dignity and it cannot be ruled by market regulations and the laws of profit .
Overturning the social policy system and policies which apply the established imperialist and monopoly interests which generate and spread poverty and misery , which have no hesitation in crushing and sacrificing entire populations and nations to their cause , is the only solution to the problem .
We say and we hope that it did .
Just as we also know that it is the easiest thing in the world for a resistance movement to say that it is disbanding and then to regroup without further ado .
At the political level , the Slav Macedonian parties are under tremendous pressure to make constitutional changes , changes opposed by the majority of the people .
The ÍÁÔÏ and European Union operation has not resolved any fundamental problems .
Once STOA 's plenary has reached a decision , we shall pass it on so that we can take what I imagine will be the right decision on such an important matter .
The Greek government is also to blame for failing to take any action whatsoever , despite the large number of accidents .
I should like to use this tribune to express our condolences to the victims ' families and to roundly condemn the unaccountability of their employers and the policy of the Greek government .
The EU , led by the three , has aligned with the USA in what is a disastrous policy for our nations and our planet .
And , of course , if , our hopes notwithstanding , there are delays , I think that the European Union should proceed unilaterally in order to establish a climate of safety in air transport .
There is also another package of measures relating to safety in the cockpit , video cameras , ground/air communications etc. , that is , the measures to which the Commissioner referred .
We would be failing in our duty if we did not do our utmost to deal with this crisis .
The current climate , with the need for additional measures to safeguard our citizens and the inability of the current information system to meet that need , should not provide fertile ground for arbitrary derogations from and extensions to its powers .
At the same time , the European Parliament needs to step up efforts to ensure that the new system functions are monitored efficiently by calling for regular progress reports .
Mr President , since it started operating in 1995 , the Schengen Information System has been used and is used , together with Europol , as a tool to facilitate repression at European level , to manufacture and monitor suspects , to combat resistance movements and disobedience policies and to devastate immigrants arriving in Europe looking for a place in the sun .
And , as if that were not enough , the recent extraordinary European Council of the European Union of the 15 gave the Americans unaccountable access to all European sources and files .
To start with , we need to make sure the citizens of the Union know what the European Employment Strategy is .
And the Member States must change their structures and implement measures to create institutions and resources which will allow local employment pacts to be applied .
I am sure other areas in the Union have had similar bad experiences , which is why we believe that the measures proposed by the honourable Member and other policies in this sector of the European Union should be coordinated and dealt with at European and national level in order to give new impetus to employment planning and implementation at local level .
Several honourable Members have raised the question of the Lisbon target , that
