Interim political and security committees and the interim military committee are up and running .
We hope to be able to deploy a thousand officers within the space of a month .
At the same time , there is clearly a fundamental debate on Europe ' s future .
We will always be receptive to this debate , but I would simply like to draw Parliament ' s attention to one crucial aspect .
The work on enlargement has moved at a great pace over these six months .
This is what we have tried to achieve over the last six months in close cooperation with the Commission , and speaking of the Commission , I would like to welcome Vice-President Patten' s presence here .
Throughout this period , of course , there has been a constant source of concern : the Balkans .
This is a fundamental problem , which makes any strategy for the Balkans extremely difficult to implement .
In other words , European citizenship should be seen in light of the values of political rationalism rather than some form of political populism , excessive nationalism , religious fundamentalism or demonstrations of xenophobia or racism .
- ( PT ) Prime Minister , I hope you understand , as a former Parliamentarian yourself , that in Parliament it is on political issues that we should focus our debate .
There are aspects of the Austrian question that are very dangerous for the future of the Union .
From the institutional point of view , this issue will clearly taint the European Union ' s internal relations unless it is quickly resolved .
As to the Intergovernmental Conference , unfortunately I do not have much speaking time left , but I must say that dangerous trends are being followed there too .
It is therefore not surprising that this virtual agreement should have been particularly warmly welcomed by those who have never been keen on a greater balance between legislation on capital and labour and who have always opposed mounting any joint action against these tax havens for tax evasion , fraud or the movement of large sums of money .
Almost the entire task has been left to the French Presidency and the most important aspect in this area has already moved beyond the normal institutional framework , into bilateral summits and various conferences and statements .
I reserve a final word of disapproval for the obvious trend towards the militarisation of the European Union .
It is evidence that we are united on the path of cooperation and that we do not take the imperial route of some countries dominating others .
The presidency can and must be divided between Member States , since this is symbolic of the fact that we share a common path .
Austria held elections and will continue to do so .
Everyone is wandering around with a torch , looking for a graceful way out .
It is amazing , hearing some of the ideas that are being bandied around , how far some people wish to force us to go beyond the limited suggestion made in Cologne .
It showed a lack of vision and a lack of respect , from what one can see .
A final word : the French Presidency has the responsibility of not ruining what the Portuguese Presidency has managed to achieve through basic realism .
I am doing so for other reasons , as I have already said here over these six months , but above all , because I feel that this Presidency has made three important marks .
Above all , there is the respect with which the Portuguese Presidency always treated this Parliament , which will certainly have contributed to future presidencies adopting a new stance in their relations with Parliament .
I would , however , like to focus on other political issues related to the second mark made by the Portuguese Presidency , this Europe with a social conscience that I mentioned , which has earned the praise of many people , in particular the Secretary-General of the European Trade Union Conference , which also held a demonstration in Oporto .
The same applies to the EU-Africa Summit , which we feel was a key point , a turning point leading to the creation of a new , necessary relationship between the European Union and Africa .
They must remain alive so that we can continue , as a Member State , to develop this project and confirm these values and a culture which is our own , which deserves our respect and above all , which is worthy of our every effort .
I would be grateful if the Bureau could clarify matters for us .
I am particularly happy to speak about this subject because I have , for a long time , publicly advocated the need for the Union to move gradually towards a single pillar structure .
Secondly , the Intergovernmental Conference .
The next question would be : will it be possible to conclude the IGC ?
With regard to the Charter of Fundamental Rights , I feel particularly comfortable with this issue , because the Portuguese Government has always recommended that a Charter of Fundamental Rights should be included in the Treaty .
The evidence that I can give you is that there has been no delay in the last six months .
Today we all recognise the fact that we are going to be living in an information society with a knowledge-based economy .
We have talked about the information society and the information society action plan has been approved .
An agreement that is not easy to conclude is not a perfect agreement , but it is a necessary compromise .
The first concerns the incident at Dover , which shocked us all .
We must do this - and let us be
