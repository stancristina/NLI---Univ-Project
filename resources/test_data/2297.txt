to ask you is this : what is really happening with transfers between euro-zone countries ?
Nevertheless , the Danish Government recently asked the Commission about the possibility of applying certain rules adopted in the field of cooperation in judicial and civil matters to Denmark by means of parallel agreements with a basis in international law .
These are based not on the Schengen rules but directly on Article 63( 4 ) of the EC Treaty .
Member States themselves are responsible for setting the conditions for issuing and validating the identity papers of their nationals .
What I said and would like to reiterate is that , up to now , the Swedish authorities have not notified any specific identity document to be recognised by all Member States as a travel document according to Directive 68/360 , which does not mean that the Swedish Government has the intention to introduce changes in their identity cards due to the reason that you have mentioned .
Madam President , last month , Parliament adopted a resolution condemning the kidnapping of eight Portuguese citizens by the LFEC .
I wish to say , Mr President , that Parliament ' s initiative played an important role in this hostage being released and that we must continue to do all that we can to ensure that the remaining Portuguese hostages in Cabinda are also finally released .
It is worth pointing out that many small farmers in Portugal are prevented from receiving proper aid for not selling all of their produce .
It should be noted that this component of public health has been treated as a separate commercial area and is currently controlled by multinationals , which undermines national and regional interests .
In answering the questions he has raised , I shall not focus on what was done in 2000 , because an exhaustive and rigorous assessment of this subject has already been made by the representatives of the Council .
The Commission takes the view that a dynamic scoreboard such as we would wish this to be responds to Mr Posselt ' s concern .
It is not my intention to question the Member States ' right of initiative .
Secondly , and it is worth saying this now , in advance of Laeken , we risk facing delays in meeting the Tampere timetable .
None of the other conventions has , to date , been signed and ratified by all 15 Member States .
We also presented a proposal on the rights and responsibilities of third-country nationals who are long-term residents .
In this policy of integrating immigrants , we must be able to count on the commitment and support of the Member States ' regions and local authorities .
I acknowledge , however , along with Mr Posselt , that the discussions in Council have not led to much opportunity for improving the financial dimension of solidarity and prove that the process of defining any form of imposing the distribution of asylum seekers amongst Member States will not be easy .
This is another initiative that the Commission will be adopting in the course of this year .
This is a simple message : the European institutions make a decisive contribution to confirming freedom , security and justice as inseparable values , true cornerstones laid out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and which express what we have in common and what we can be proud of .
Very briefly , to touch upon two points : first , on the action plan for Iraq , I share the view that it is extremely difficult to implement this action plan .
There has been a very important Swedish initiative on synthetic drugs .
My final wish and hope is that maybe next year we will have a more cheerful debate on the state of play in the area of freedom , security and justice .
We are all - I hope - aware of the tragic situation these countries are experiencing .
It is also crucial that the European Union and each of the Member States adopt a position clearly endorsing this right by fighting to ensure that the current trend to reduce financial aid by the industrialised countries is reversed and that a timetable is set to increase aid by 0.7 % of GDP , by acting in such a way that the 1992 Rio de Janeiro commitments are reiterated , by contributing to the definitive writing-off of the debt that is clearly smothering these countries , by making themselves available and taking action on conflict prevention , and by paying particular attention to arms trafficking and combating this trade .
I would simply like to emphasise that this is an initiative to be welcomed , although it is of limited scope and although it contains some aspects that need to be fine-tuned .
This is what happened in Nice and what is happening again today with mad cow disease or foot-and-mouth .
The persistent breach of the professional secrecy of lawyers and those in similar professions is unacceptable .
It is quite unacceptable under any rule of law that is worthy of the name that lawyers should be forced by the law to become informers .
As a matter of fact , the proposal also contains other little traps , such as the open door to Member States to extend the type of information supplied by lawyers to other areas , which makes the Council ' s text particularly dangerous and perverse .
First and foremost , we have focused on the importance of cooperation and exchanges of information between the Member States ' judicial authorities , with a view to creating an area of freedom , security and justice .
I hope that the qualities he has always demonstrated will enable improvements , which we can all see are urgent and much needed , to be brought to this thorny and delicate subject
