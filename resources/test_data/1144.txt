I have always supported these initiatives , ever since 2004 was designated as ' European Year of Education through Sport ' - and I stated this in the earliest debates on the matter in this House .
( PT ) The conclusions of the Copenhagen Summit demonstrate that the European Council has opted to put off resolving serious problems , and has instead taken a radical step forwards , having decided on an enlargement involving more than ten countries , on a basis of discrimination , not only towards these countries , but also towards the current Member States with the weakest economies and greatest social problems , such as Portugal .
We also reject the conclusions ' support for closer links between the EU and NATO , under the comprehensive agreement that has been concluded .
With regard to Portugal in particular , this debate will certainly take account of the specific characteristics of Portuguese farming and the abnormally low income of Portuguese farmers as a consequence of our only joining the European Community in 1986 , when the other Member States had been benefiting from it since 1962 .
The Commission must also , however , undertake and provide us with a detailed and rigorous study of the entire Prestige crisis , including the way in which it was managed in practical terms .
Mr President , following on from what Mrs Frahm said , I should like to express my great disappointment at the fact that the Iranian regime , which distinguished itself in 2002 as being one of the world 's most repressive towards its own people , which breached human rights more than any other , has not been condemned by the United Nations because the European Union decided not to propose this condemnation .
The same cannot be said , however , for therapeutic cloning .
The report that has been presented to you today is a document that is both vast and ambitious , because it attempts to provide an overview of the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union and its Member States and because it calls on the national authorities and the European institutions to adopt practical measures .
An excellent example of this cooperation is surely the Commission 's creation , following Parliament 's resolution of July 2001 , of a network of experts in the field of fundamental rights .
By the same token , this network will be obliged to provide Parliament and the Commission with information on the sensitive issue of the balance between security and freedom in the context of the fight against terrorism , an area that will receive particular attention in the report that is currently being drawn up as part of the network 's work .
At the same time , however , a pragmatic and effective assessment must be made of the quality of protection of fundamental rights .
Hence my disappointment with the report that has been presented ; with its lack of balance and rigor .
In choosing to give , in the explanatory statement , a lengthy and detailed description of possible breaches of fundamental rights by some Member States , this report has led to claims and accusations against these Member States that cannot be refuted and have not even been submitted to a democratic vote because they are not included in the text of the motion for a resolution .
This will clearly always be the case until we have a legally applicable Charter of Fundamental Rights ; only then will things be done differently .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like first of all to thank Mr Hubert Pirker for his report , which has focused not only on the Commission communication on the management of the EU 's external borders , but also on the action plan adopted by the Council .
We need to harmonise the way in which the Schengen acquis is implemented and we are doing so in two ways : firstly by revising the Common Schengen Manual , and the Commission will , in the first six months of this year , be submitting a proposal for this revision .
In this field , the Commission plans at the Salonika European Council , this coming July , to present a viability study into the launching of the on-line visa system at European level .
These two operations were , in 2002 , funded by the ARGO Programme and new actions for operational cooperation have already been presented for 2003 .
I hope that , with the motion for a resolution tabled by Mr Pirker , which will be voted on here tomorrow , Parliament will be able to give a decisive boost to this ambitious , demanding and crucial programme of action to control the external border of the European Union in order to enhance the domestic security of all Member States .
This situation takes on even more significance as a result of enlargement , when the new Member States will gradually take over the task of ensuring security at the external borders , with a considerable proportion of responsibility being transferred to those countries .
The rapporteur invokes the 'decision taken last year by Parliament 's Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms , Justice and Home Affairs ( LIBE ) to use the Charter as a guideline for the annual report on the human rights situation in the EU' , and adds that ' Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union ( ? ) has given [this work ] greater focus and direction ' .
If we add to this flagrant methodological deviation the regrettable inconstancy with which many of the comments about these Member States are made without sufficient objective and appropriate grounds ( as the rapporteur herself admits ) , we have a set of basic reasons why in accordance with its own premises , the Swiebel report must be rejected
