denied fundamental human rights .
That is why we want a referendum in every Member State , as public opinion in our States demands .
As far as I am aware , this possibility is not the one currently to be found in the Treaties , but it should be found in the so-called ' Reform Treaty ' , which is not yet even at the negotiation stage in the Intergovernmental Conference .
It is essential that the regional cohesion policy is strengthened , with the much-vaunted social and economic cohesion and real convergence set as a central objective and policy of the European Union , reinforcing the redistributive role of the community budget and providing adequate funding so that the objectives proposed may effectively be achieved .
Also , habits in alcohol consumption vary widely in different parts of Europe .
These campaigns should start in schools .
Member States must strengthen the control mechanisms and secure compliance with the legislation involving the business sector , in other words we must all take responsibility and fight abuse , but we must not demonise moderate or irresponsible consumption . on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . - ( PT ) Generally speaking , we agree with Mrs Jeggle 's proposals in the three reports she has presented , notably the proposal to use the budgetary savings to set up a restructuring programme which could be used for marketing support and nutrition information on quantities of milk and milk products .
Even though some speakers have repeated to exhaustion the safeguarding of human rights in this 'fight against terrorism ' and in the offensive of security measures backing up that fight , a growing number of situations and facts point to a failure to respect citizens ' fundamental freedoms , rights and guarantees .
It is well known that workers are often required to work long hours , without proper housing , even with no contract of employment , and are paid much less than initially agreed .
It is against that background that we must view the recent financial turbulence that I mentioned earlier .
Implementation of that agenda is the best contribution we can make to strengthening the potential for growth in the European economy and maintaining solid foundations and the Portuguese Presidency remains strongly committed in that field .
As the honourable Member knows , there is a kind of annual review of the process of Turkey 's accession to the EU.
Since Ireland and the United Kingdom have not made any such request , the Council Presidency can do little with regard to this matter .
Only yesterday I had the opportunity to point out here to some honourable Members of the European Parliament that , since we ourselves had a dictatorship in Portugal until 1974 , we are particularly sensitive to anything relating to democracy , the rule of law and human rights .
Furthermore , the Council stated that such measures would be revoked only when the conditions were in place to guarantee respect for human rights , democratic principles and the rule of law .
The Council is looking forward to seeing the first results of these African initiatives ; if appropriate it will review its position accordingly .
With Africa we have to discuss immigration , the economy , trade , energy , the climate , and also naturally human rights and good governance , subjects which we have already been discussing and which were also debated and discussed at the first Summit held in Cairo in 2000 during Portugal 's previous Presidency .
On the third question , the Council would point out that the construction of a new gas pipeline in the north of Europe along that route is in accordance with the objective of the European Union 's energy policy to improve the Community 's security of supply .
I thank the honourable Member for his question .
As regards flexicurity , I can tell you that for Portugal and for this Portuguese Presidency flexicurity means flexibility but also security and for us the two go together .
The problem is that application of that concept entails many problems which were , moreover , very well described by our rapporteur and by our colleague , Mrs Doyle , and we cannot merely base our actions on blind application of the concept , but must try to improve its effectiveness , checking where it failed and where it produced good results and I do not sincerely believe that this communication has achieved that ; we must use all other additional means to go further .
For that it is essential to take account of the natural characteristics of each fisheries resource , as well as to know the nature and type of fishing methods .
Various scientists think it is preferable to set F0.1 as the fishing mortality rate rather than , for example , FMSY , which they regard as less appropriate .
We might recall the Union 's objectives on the death penalty , as enshrined in the guidelines .
Parliament called for the European Union to take such an initiative in two resolutions adopted this year in February and in April .
For example , between 1 July 2006 and 30 June 2007 , the European Union made general demarches on the death penalty in 28 countries , from Bahrain to Zambia ; we also made demarches on individual cases in various countries from Yemen to Iran ; furthermore , there are frequent EU declarations on this subject .
Despite the continuing concern about the use of the death penalty , we are very pleased to note a global trend towards abolition or introducing a moratorium on the death penalty .
We must not forget that this is our third attempt , I repeat , our third attempt to obtain a resolution on the death penalty at the United Nations General Assembly following our two failures in 1994 and 1999 .
