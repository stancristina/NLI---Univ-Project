is really created simply through our not successfully implementing other commitments .
We have had to postpone other promised projects .
The situation is slightly reminiscent of the discussion we had in the budget debate earlier about the fact that the Council is happy to issue promises but then does not arrange satisfactory financing .
Commissioner , Mr Arvidsson , I can agree with everything that you , Mr Arvidsson , said about the importance and environmental significance of this decision .
We have set a ceiling of EUR 100 million .
At the same time , we know that the budget of the North West Sewage Treatment Works has significantly exceeded Finland ' s and the Nordic Investment Bank ' s estimates .
I , therefore , appeal to my fellow MEPs to show solidarity on this issue .
That is unfortunately not the case .
The present values also lead to large discrepancies in salaries between men and women .
Maternity and paternity leave must obviously be brought into line with each other .
I should like to conclude by saying that I feel dissatisfied with Amendment 7.
The wording , work of equal value is not enough , for there is then a risk of employers less conscious of their responsibilities exploiting this opportunity to create worse conditions for parental leave .
Unfortunately , there are many such examples in my own country , too .
In view of the fact that Mrs Lulling spoke so clearly , all of us in this House understand that Amendment 17 will of course be supported by Mrs Lulling , and for that I am very grateful .
Imagine if one in two men were subject to sexual harassment .
However , it is women , and not men , who are discriminated against in this way .
Countries must take active measures to promote equality in practice .
Employers should be responsible for ensuring that their employees are not harassed and that they have equal wages for equal work and the opportunity to pursue careers and , especially , to combine work and family life .
We are mainly well disposed towards Mrs Weiler ' s report .
Because these amendments have been adopted by the House , we chose to abstain in the final vote .
I hope that the Council will take his views on board .
Transparency is one such issue .
That is not acceptable .
A separate department must be formed within the Council in which the ministers meet entirely openly and in public in order to legislate .
There must , moreover , be proper Minutes issued afterwards .
A great many decisions are made during these meetings of rather doubtful status .
It also states that the results of votes and the explanations of vote referring to legislative texts must be published .
In turn , that will lead to growing demands for a concentration of the EU' s tasks and the need to limit the EU' s powers of decision-making .
Mr President , in Doha the EU must show its hand .
According to what Commissioner Lamy said in a statement earlier today , the EU' s main objective is to open the markets of the developing countries to EU companies .
It is then that a 'policy of naked interest ' appears , that is to say , a policy that places the EU alongside the United States and against the majority of the world ' s poorer countries .
Mr DÃ©sir ' s report is an excellent instrument for bringing about something more akin to global justice in world trade .
Less injustice will increase the safety of us all .
Fundamental human rights must be respected , the fight against environmental devastation intensified and child labour prohibited .
Mr President , I want to thank Mr Lamassoure for his sterling work .
I wish to put the following question to the Commissioner with responsibility for enlargement , Mr Verheugen .
In that case , what will have become of our credibility in working for peace ?
It is said that this is a one-way market opening process .
The EU does not need to do very much .
I have a number of doubts on that score .
Criticisms are being made in China .
The author , who is an economist at Beijing Aeronautic University , maintains that China will lose to a system that is dominated by transnational companies .
The Chinese economy is not strong enough , and it will be the poorest classes that will have to pay a heavy price in the form of unemployment and social insecurity .
That is one of the things that the Chinese leaders fear most .
This uneasiness is , in all likelihood , about the possible consequences within the governing party , too .
China Online reported , for example , in August of this year , that approximately 18 per cent of the total number of employees within the State sector are estimated to be surplus to requirements .
It is said that they will be still more surplus to requirements following accession to the WTO .
The prospects for new jobs are very limited because those who are made redundant are often older , unqualified workers .
Many commentators still believe , however , that accession will lead to enormous changes in the countryside and have enormous consequences when China is opened up to imports of food and agricultural products from , for example , the United States .
The point of the quotations is that I , again , wanted to emphasise how odd I think it is that the Commission should be presenting the Council and Parliament with a document in which there is not a single word to suggest that accession to the WTO might lead to difficulties in the world ' s most heavily populated country .
I do not draw the conclusion that we must say 'no ' .
