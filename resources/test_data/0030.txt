, to raise a series of questions that have occurred to me regarding Amendments Nos 1 and 2 , which ask that the changes in fishing techniques to be adopted under this proposal should be subsidised under the FIFG.
Commissioner , I should really like you to clarify this point , seeing that Article 16( 2 ) is open to all kinds of interpretations .
Mr MacCormick , himself , has just pointed out that the principle was expressed by a pope , and it is clear that it is impregnated with theological considerations .
The poor Commission has made a very commendable effort with the documents ' Better Lawmaking 1998 ' and ' Better Lawmaking 1999 ' , in which it tries to be tolerant with this nonsense approved by the governments in the Treaty on European Union and the added Protocol .
We hope the House can accept our amendments , and if so we shall vote in favour .
Mr President , any of the observations I made about the SLIM report could equally apply here .
Several accomplished speakers from the European People ' s Party have already taken the floor to express the views of the group .
An understanding of the principle of subsidiarity depends greatly on what the political will is at any moment .
This is therefore doubly serious .
As stated in our proposal , it is impossible that within the context of close relations of every kind ( political , economic , commercial , financial , cultural , etc. ) between two parties who have signed an association agreement for there to be no room for the fisheries cooperation that the European Union is asking for .
We also tell the Commission in section 8 what we expect from it should it be unable to reach a satisfactory agreement .
I , however , believe that if this really were the case , this difficult matter of the Fisheries Agreement with Morocco would have been addressed from the start with a global approach , involving all the Commissioners .
What has not been achieved in eleven months will be difficult to achieve in a few days .
Does it benefit a sector which , more enterprising than the negotiators themselves , is going to Morocco and seeing that what is impossible for Brussels is possible for them : speaking directly to the Moroccans , establishing close contacts , principles of trade , industrial and fisheries agreements ?
Moroccan agriculture enjoys special treatment when exporting to Europe .
If employment is truly one of the European Union ' s priorities for action , an economic sector such as fisheries cannot continue to be sidelined .
This House has been quite rightly criticised along with the Commission regarding the agreement with Morocco , which from the outset has been addressed with tremendous hesitation and naivety .
However , in no way can this mean that the PPE-DE Group is opposed to private fisheries agreements , simply because opposing them would mean condemning half of the Community fleet .
I have nothing more to say , Mr President , except to express my hopes for the best before the meeting on the 30th .
If we help Morocco to over-exploit this territory , which is awaiting a UN-supervised referendum , if we develop a Moroccan fishing fleet to exploit the fish in this territory , what will happen when this territory becomes self-governing and what will we do with the Moroccan fleet ?
At the moment , various Spanish regions , the Canaries , Andalusia and Galicia , and some Portuguese regions , are directly affected by the cessation of fishing activities .
This Andalusian MEP has been negotiating and proposing initiatives for a year in corridors , in offices , in the Committee on Fisheries and in the hearings with the Commissioner so that the highly specific idiosyncrasies of the Andalusian fishing fleet working in Morocco would be taken into account .
Mr President , the tender fruit negotiation will be opened up in three days ' time , and we will then know if it is ripe or green , or sufficiently ripe for us all to feel calm and for both the parties concerned , the European Union and Morocco , to start sounding out methods of cooperation and agreements in a manner that is flexible , Commissioner , but also serious and rigorous , so that the Community fishing fleet may recommence its activities in those waters .
If this was not the intention of those who proposed this resolution , if through lack of experience - not through lack of scruples , I am sure - what was intended was to bring an internal , domestic affair before this Parliament - as the spokesman for the Spanish Socialists in the Spanish national parliament recognised at the weekend - then of course they cannot count on the Group of the European People ' s Party to play this game .
If the European People ' s Party is proposing that at the next part-session we should support having this question taken up , we may consider it ; if it is just a delaying tactic , we will be against it .
Can this House back the refusal of dialogue ?
To do this we have to take care that measures do not become dispersed , with the creation of an absolutely lopsided situation in which , as Mr MacCormick has so rightly said , one part of the process suffers .
At some moment , we will have to compile all these texts because , Mr President , you and , doubtless , all of us here know that for this to be implemented by judges - who are the ones that have to implement it while guaranteeing the right to a fair trial - with this scattered system we are , of course , very poorly guided
