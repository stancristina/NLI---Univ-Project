In the case of the Western Balkans , it is really a question of crisis prevention , but also of economic reforms and financial initiatives .
During its presidency , Sweden will work for a continued active European role in the peace process .
Outstanding disputes about trade policy must be resolved through mutually acceptable solutions but they must not overshadow the many common political interests and the rich dialogue we have with the United States .
The Treaty of Amsterdam created a legal basis for rules governing public access to the institutions ' documents .
We intend to push this issue with a view to achieving a successful outcome by the spring .
The European Union must also take an active part in the UN Human Rights Commission and in the run-up to the forthcoming world conference in this area .
We shall actively participate in the important European political dialogue taking place in this building , in this Parliament .
It can show our fellow countrymen at home that good things can be accomplished together in the EU.
It can show our European colleagues here that Sweden is not in opposition to the European project but , rather , wishes to take a constructive part in it .
We would also like to have a date for when the first countries will be able to join us .
We have great hopes of Sweden and of Sweden' s role in promoting and powerfully defending the model applied , for instance , in Sweden and the Netherlands .
The EU' s tasks and powers must be more clearly defined .
It would be nice to be told in rather more concrete terms how the Prime Minister views this task , the method and these issues , which require further work before the Belgian Presidency begins .
Personally , I am convinced that Sweden will once more confirm the rule that the smaller Member States are often more impartial , something which will favour the common European interest over narrower national interests .
My Group wants to see progress particularly in the following areas .
Civil crisis management is something which can be promoted under a Swedish Presidency .
The environment must no longer be damaged and animals must no longer be mistreated .
Environmental taxes are an obvious example .
This will not lead to the openness you are striving for .
I hope you take up the challenge set out by the President of the Commission .
There are also other positive features of the programme which deserve to be highlighted .
No reforms to the EU were actually made there which would facilitate enlargement .
My first question to the Swedish Presidency is therefore the following : Are you prepared to deal with , and rectify , this mistake in the Accession Treaties which are now about to be negotiated ?
Real left-wing politics must give top priority to employment even in matters of economic policy , instead of to the dogmatic monetarism which currently dominates the EU and economic and monetary union .
In various parts of the European Union , there are growing demands for the continuous deregulations and free speculation we are witnessing today to be replaced by a situation in which unbridled capitalism is controlled by political decisions .
My second question to the presidency is therefore the following : What initiatives regarding a ' Tobin tax ' are you planning during your presidency ?
Sweden' s action in the settlement regarding genetically modified crops , which was recently finalised , was disappointing .
Instead , we have seen how Sweden accepts deterioration , most recently by increasing the responsibility borne by transporters .
The EU army will even include Turkish troops .
I am looking forward to the responses to my three questions .
Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioners , it is so pleasant to see Sweden holding the presidency of the EU for the first time .
We Moderates have always fought for Sweden in Europe , but unfortunately we have to point out that Sweden is only responsible for 'half a presidency ' since it is Belgium , instead , which will be responsible for the issues relating to the euro .
Development in this area has been surprisingly rapid , but the ambitions must now be given some substance .
In ten years ' time , the EU will have the most dynamic economy in the world .
The markets for telecommunications , mail , electricity and rail traffic , as well as agriculture , were liberalised .
May it become a deregulation summit for jobs and prosperity .
That , if anything , will show solidarity with the poor of the world .
The Tobin tax is a threat to the poor of the world .
Madam President , Members of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , I am delighted to welcome the Prime Minister of Sweden , Mr GÃ¶ran Persson to Parliament .
The most important one is , of course , enlargement .
I hope that the negotiations with the first countries can soon be brought to a successful conclusion and that a target date can soon be set for the accession of these first countries .
The second priority concerns jobs .
What we in Parliament would like is to have a part to play in this method - just as we have in the case of legislation - since it is becoming increasingly important .
I would like to receive some indication to this effect .
The EU is , after all , fairly successful where environmental policy is concerned .
It was important , especially for the enlargement process , that there was agreement in Nice .
I trust that Sweden will also actively pursue the goal of a more open decision-making process .
Active crisis management is about trying to prevent
