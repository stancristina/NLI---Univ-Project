it is often the case that a written explanation of voting is submitted , if it is known , for example , that the vote is to take place at Thursday lunchtime .
Mr President , on behalf of the Liberal group I would like to say that we have serious doubts about this phase of the work .
This is where we should be concentrating our efforts now and I hope that the Commission will commence work seriously on this .
I hope that these will still be secure under the Directive even after the Commission 's scrutiny of it .
This is why we have made an amendment proposal for this particular point .
Ladies and gentlemen , I also think that the legal committee has made several proposals which are out of place in the modern world .
For example , the proposed obligation that a report be published annually for five years after the take-over showing how employment has progressed .
Mr President , I would like to begin by thanking Mrs Baldi for the amount of work she has put into this very complicated and important issue .
The Directive itself is difficult and technical , but adopting a political stance will be simpler when we see the effects .
It is Article 16 of the Directive which concentrates primarily on the working environment .
We are talking about safety at work here .
Against this background it seems somewhat unrealistic to say that it is consumer interest groups who want the impact of this Directive lessened .
Consequently , we will also be voting against all those proposals which have been raised again here aimed at reducing the standard of data sheets .
It is very important that the new Members are not forced to reduce the standard of their legislation by adopting regulations which are too weak .
Such privileges are damaging to democracy and create a gulf between us and our people .
This is a very strange proposal .
It is contrary to national constitutions that foreign based parties should be able to intervene and be active in national politics , in competition with national independent parties .
The creation of such 'super parties ' which stand above society and above the people is alien to all democratic tradition .
The whole of this absurd idea should be rejected .
In contrast to the views put forward by many of the speakers here , I do not think that we should be concerned about the USA 's technological leadership in this area .
Europe has trade advantages in other areas instead , so it will not be a disaster if Europe does not become a world leader in every sector of Information Technology .
It is currently young , well educated and highly paid men who clearly predominate in the field of information technology .
Even now , we see well-off families , who are able to afford it , linking their home PCs to the Internet and in so doing giving their children knowledge of this technology right from infancy .
The fact that people located right up in the North can work together with people in the South on the same project gives us an opportunity to develop rural areas and to reduce the population concentration in the cities .
There is one point in the action plan which mentions G12000 , but there has been no action , although the French , German , Spanish and Dutch Ministers asked for action in this area in a letter to the Commission in 1994 .
If it is not included , the EU will be unable to do what is required of us , or what we promised at the G7 information conference a few years ago .
The Protocol on asylum policy includes an Article which means essentially that an EU citizen is prevented from receiving asylum in another EU State .
After the decision was taken attempts were made to tone down its effect .
Madam President , I also think that we have reason to welcome the Treaty and congratulate the Dutch Presidency .
Now we must fulfil the Article in the Treaty through practical action .
But there are great differences between the Member States in this respect .
I would like to point out that , even if I have spoken a great deal about Swedish issues , I think that these are now European interests .
I say that this is an excellent report from the Ombudsman and I hope it will set the precedent for future reports .
I also think that this one and a half year period has demonstrated that the Ombudsman is needed as the guardian of the guardians , as he said about Article 169 .
I also think that current legislation must be made to satisfy society 's new demands , particularly with regard to the ethical and social impact .
I very much regret that politically we have not progressed towards real , practical proposals which promote global co-operation instead of commercial competition , especially as there is such a serious issue at stake here , the health and biological diversity of mankind , not just in the European Union but in the whole world .
The deciding factor for me , when my group and I adopted our position on this , was something which Mr Pompidou has already mentioned , and that is the fact that it is patent legislation which is under consideration .
We have a European Convention to protect human dignity in the application of medicine and biology ; this also applies to patents .
So , if the unacceptable occurs , we must be prepared to review the legislation .
This is , of course , wrong !
The most sensational claim is that , without the Patent Directive , large companies would keep their research results secret
