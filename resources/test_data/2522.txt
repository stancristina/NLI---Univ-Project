That applies , unfortunately , not only to the Holocaust which we have just been talking about but also to other events which there will be a desire to remember and use as a point of departure in the fight against intolerance and xenophobia .
For example , there is Crystal Night , which is important to remember in many countries , and we have the days around the end of the war in 1945 , which can also be important days to remember .
In the light of scientific opinions from the ICES , recommending that lowest possible catches be adhered to and that a recovery plan be implemented for the stock in question , the Council has laid down the Total Allowable Catch for hake at 22 623 tonnes , compared with 42 090 tonnes during 2000 .
Measures for 2002 must be taken in the light of the current discussion concerning a recovery plan for hake .
Because there is clear scientific evidence that the hake stock is at present considerably over-fished , a number of measures have been proposed by the scientific advisers in this area .
That also applies to chairmanships that do not go with the Presidency , such as the chairmanships of the Economic and Social Committee or the Committee for Economic Policy .
Thank you for your answer .
Do you intend to send out that information ?
Sometimes , it is an awfully long way between Stockholm and Strasbourg , but I can promise that the answer is on its way .
Much has been achieved .
Algeria has already given its preliminary approval to the following human rights wording : ' Respect for the democratic principles and fundamental human rights established by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights inspires the domestic and external policies of Algeria and constitutes an essential element of this Agreement . '
In the ongoing negotiations , agreement has also been reached concerning two important matters affecting the situation of women .
Through the Swedish Foreign Minister , the Presidency addressed the issue at the meeting for political dialogue between the European Union and Algeria which took place in Algeria on 24 April .
Within the framework of MEDA' s technical and financial aid to Algeria , the EU supports a project for modernising the police force .
Once the Association Agreement with Algeria that I have just mentioned has been concluded , the political dialogue with Algeria will be institutionalised .
It is important that the General Declaration of Human Rights in the Association Agreement should cover not only women but also minorities .
That is repeated the whole time in the dialogue with Algeria , and we shall be able to repeat it still more powerfully once we obtain an Association Agreement .
Let us therefore work together in order to achieve this .
It is not , in any case , because an Association Agreement would give a government or a country some kind of carte blanche to do whatever it likes .
As the case of Turkey shows , the Association Agreement is an effective instrument enabling the European Union to highlight and criticise states of affairs it does not accept .
I shall therefore give a relatively long answer , in spite of the lateness of the hour .
The Regulation was the result of intensive discussions in the Council , where full account was taken of the consequence analysis prepared by the Commission and of the Member States ' need for assurances concerning the more detailed provisions for implementing the proposed system .
These assurances related not only to the Member States ' interests , but also to the consequences of the proposal for those ACP states that are not among the least developed countries , as well as to the desire to guarantee that the least developed countries themselves , rather than third parties , benefit from the new system .
When it came to bananas , rice and sugar , implementation was therefore deferred until such time as agreement had been reached on the principle of access without duties and quotas .
As has been mentioned previously , adjustments have been made to the Regulation so that account might be taken of the misgivings experienced in this regard in the European Union and the banana-producing ACP countries that do not belong to the group of least developed countries .
As the honourable Member certainly knows , the Council is fully aware of its ACP partners ' problems when it comes to the operation of the banana market and is doing its utmost to take account of these misgivings in all relevant initiatives .
In very general terms , those parts of the agreement concerning ACP suppliers are designed to protect the latter ' s position by guaranteeing more reliable and more favourable conditions for the ACP states ' access to the EU market .
Parliament ' s views will , of course , be sought regarding each possible change to the Council Regulation on the common organisation of the market in bananas .
It is precisely in order to be able to counter such measures that the Commission will be reporting - next time in 2005 .
Madam President , history will show that decisions to set up networks are more important than many other decisions we take .
As previous speakers have pointed out , it is important that the rules relating to personal protection are respected .
It is extremely rare for prosecutors to deal with these crimes .
That must be respected , as it also was in the Tampere conclusions , which are the basis for our decision and discussion today .
Thus , they do not safeguard justice for minorities and the protection of the latter .
Today ' s decision is premature .
The European Parliament believes that , to be eligible for subsidy at European level , financed by taxation , a
