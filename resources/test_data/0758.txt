Lastly , no one has to date been able to produce powerful , irrefutable and convincing arguments that prove the benefit and the harmless nature of GMOs .
This is the real challenge we face .
Optimism about the state of the negotiations must , therefore , be relative .
Brazil , Argentina , Uruguay and Paraguay have a real need to pursue thoroughgoing reform .
Beyond the figures , the main problem lies in the make-up of trade and exports from those countries , which still contains structural weaknesses because it is essentially dominated by some basic products , such as oil , diamonds and cocoa .
The answer to Mr Purvis 's question is no .
Nevertheless , given the state of the world , we cannot refrain from using the eggs available to us in order to take things forward .
Our strategy remains the same .
We simply have to increase both sides ' level of confidence in the system .
This can quite easily be checked and investigated .
These issues of marks of origin are complex and we are discussing them in a very general way .
Mr President , Commissioner , please excuse me for not being present when you called my question .
Since the best is always the enemy of the good , are we not in danger , in our commendable desire to protect allergy sufferers , of weakening traditional production methods through such measures , even causing markets to go bust , with no scientific proof of the harmful character of these aids ?
On the other hand , alarmist labelling would terrify consumers who suffer from allergies and reduce their own consumption .
It is a sad fact that this is not the case .
With all the more reason , it is disgusted by the policies of those in government in Rome who are carrying European trends to the point of absurdity .
Nor is it the option favoured by the European institutions .
Issues such as environmental protection that are the subjects of conflict between the two sides of the Atlantic , should be approached on a more pragmatic basis .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I shall let you into a secret : I prefer your own emollient presentation to the contribution , here in Strasbourg yesterday , by the French Prime Minister , whose game was one of national division .
The Stability and Growth Pact should thus become both stronger and more flexible at the same time .
Growth and stability are the two motors that will enable the European economy to move forward .
.
( FR ) No compromise is entirely satisfactory .
State sovereignty implies that states retain the power only to admit onto their territory desired and chosen products corresponding to real needs .
This improvement is a lesser evil that must not cause us to forget the basic question .
Finally , it must be ensured that operators who choose not to use GMOs can derive a commercial advantage from their choice .
Together with the champions of wine growers and of common sense , we have tabled the amendments needed to extricate wine from this phobic and neurotic demand for labelling .
That is why I voted against , and I call urgently for the speeding up of research programmes for the production of non-polluting energy .
In the particular case of the iron and steel industry , inclusion of such a reference could have prevented the rights corresponding to blast furnace gases that are sent to electricity companies to be converted into energy that is used by iron and steel plants from being granted to the electricity companies under the national allocation plans when , without them , those companies could replace those energy sources with others such as natural gas .
It obliges us to get away from our usual responses and I am very glad of that .
There seem to have been a few developments , but they are not confirmed and it is clear that the US position will have to change if a global agreement is to be reached at Cancun .
It is now up to our partners to take initiatives , the US in particular , since in the last few years they have reintroduced a system that creates distortions .
You know our programme in this field : greater consistency between multilateral environmental agreements and the rules of international trade .
We will do so with you .
Let us not forget the spirit of Doha .
European consumers are making ever-tougher demands about food safety , product quality and production conditions .
How can the EU play its part as a bridge-builder and point the US in the right direction ?
Thank you , too , for matching words with deeds in one or other area where the WTO ought to act differently .
Was not the avowed aim of the CAP reform to improve the Union 's negotiating position in the Doha round and not to define the agricultural policy the Europeans need ?
The right to health , education , food safety , and energy should prevail above commercial interests .
We must move towards what some of the developing countries want .
I would like to point out , in response to Mr Souchet , that this reform of the common agricultural policy was made with European considerations in mind , by Europeans and for Europeans .
We must stay firm on the need to deal with these issues , while responding to the justified and repeated concerns of a number of developing countries , to the fear that they have that by committing to multilateral agreements on these subjects , they would be reducing the area of autonomy of their economic policies .
To some extent , we made do with our bilateral policies in order to
