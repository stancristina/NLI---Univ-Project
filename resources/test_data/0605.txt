multilateral agreements must be kept open for as long as possible .
It is of course intolerable that Western businesses should be helping repressive governments to trample human rights underfoot .
We must also make it perfectly clear what we stand for .
Madam President , I think we are discussing an important topic today .
A car which is more economic in its fuel consumption , and therefore uses less CO2 , will cost less , and we in this House also want other substances , such as nitrogen oxide and soot particles , included in the equation .
I think that , based on the experience in my own country , this registration tax can also be used to promote the use of environmentally-friendly cars , the sale of which in the Netherlands has been boosted enormously through their no longer being taxed .
Various Member States , when determining car tax , already take greater account of the pollution they cause .
The aim should be to reduce harmful emissions rather than provide the car industry , even after the market has been saturated , with customers who are keen to buy the latest model every year .
Belt-tightening measures and privatisation in this sector , supported by the European Union , have so far had only the opposite effect .     Madam President , according to a Dutch newspaper this summer , car purchasing tax is being evaded on a massive scale in the Netherlands .
Registration and motorised vehicle tax do not belong to the harmonised taxes .
The nationalistic , patriotic discourses of those men degenerated into language with genocide overtones , and it is regrettable that other candidates adopted it as well .
As I fear that the developing countries will be footing the bill for this suspension , I would call on Commissioner Mandelson to monitor the interests of those countries both multilaterally and bilaterally .
The objective of the WTO negotiations , as we know , was to improve the position of the developing countries , and all those involved had to do their bit : Europe in the area of import tariffs for agricultural products , the United States in the shape of internal support to farmers , developing countries , such as Brazil and India , with regard to access to their markets for industrial products , and suchlike .
Finally , I should like to mention the Export Promotion Organisations ( EPOs ) that are related to the WTO .
At the same time , does he not share my view that a frontloading measure of this kind could also help get things back on track for the least developed countries ?
The efforts many have made to take action against forced prostitution and human trafficking at the time of the World Cup have not been rewarded with constructive action by the parties involved .
The Commission , however , went to the Court of Justice to fight this change , resulting in years of uncertainty for the sector , with the Court’s ruling only complicating matters even further .
That is hardly conducive to the consistency of legislation , and also leads to a whole procedure of repair legislation such as that on which we are about to vote .
I support the proposals , where possible , to cut down on costs by discouraging very late cancellations and applications .
It is also becoming increasingly clear that more attention will need to go to the situation of street children who not only become the victim of drug and human traffickers , but also suffer from violence and sexual abuse .
If there are no funds for day-nursery facilities or for sick , elderly or disabled people , it is often the women , wives and mothers who stay at home to look after them .
The central question is whether the social security systems , which are very different but are all based on certain values , can deliver what was promised when they were first set up .
I am also pleased to hear that the emission allowance trading system is working well in the eyes of the Commissioner and the Council .
Our group has put its heart and soul into bringing this directive about , and that is why it is important that it works well .
Can you inform me whether the Maltese authorities have already sent the Commission an exemption report on this 2005 spring hunting , and what their duties are in this respect ?
Since problems mainly occur in the developing countries , the poor countries , that is also where I can foresee the biggest problems when it comes to dealing with this piracy efficiently and adequately .
More could be done perhaps in that area .
It has been said several times this evening that one in four Europeans , or one hundred million of us , experience a bout of serious illness at least once in their lives .
What matters is that expertise is combined , that practitioners learn from one another , that patients or addicts gain awareness of successful treatment methods .
We must , above all , be able to improve the connection between the various and different measures at Member State level , both nationally and regionally .
Mental illness also belongs to this list , though .
Mr President , may I put a point of order ?
Those are crucial tasks which soon , when the UN has left , and preparations for their departure are in full swing , will be the responsibility of the EU.
I too was a member of the delegation that visited Kosovo and Belgrade in Serbia .
That is also obvious from talking to people .
After all , it is apparent from discussions with people in Kosovo that many are critical of the UN’s role .
