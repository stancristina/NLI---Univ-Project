the case in the future , as genetic technology may help us to move away from non-natural methods in other contexts .
Let me finish by saying that it is important that we do not make this too complicated or unwieldy .
These guidelines were put forward by the Commission in 1995 .
It is also important and beneficial that we establish those projects which are in the public interest and that a number of these are prioritised , such as distance learning , small and medium sized companies , the environment and health and satellite communication .
To be honest there are certain parts of the answer which I do not understand .
It is therefore totally illogical to say that this distorts competition or is a cost advantage .
There is absolutely no final assembly operation of finished lorries , only component manufacture .
I wonder if I can have an explanation of two points from the Commissioner .
The content of this report is being kept secret even from the Swedish Government .
But you must understand that the message you are now delivering is complete news to me since even during the Membership negotiations it was said that the steel , cars and shipping sectors would not be entitled to transport aid .
The reason that we want this report out in the open is not because we want to reveal any business secrets which Volvo may have - the Swedish government will not do that .
A little question : If you , Commissioner were asked by the Chairman of the Council to make this report public at least for the Swedish government would you do so ?
This question has been partially but not fully answered .
Perhaps it would facilitate this debate and make the issue clearer .
Transport aid has also been given to Scania , one of Volvo 's competitors which is located quite close to the Volvo factory , where rear axles and chassis for heavy goods vehicles are manufactured .
The other point for which there has been no explanation is the fact that this will distort competition .
This strengthens the view that the Commission has something to hide .
Remember Vilvoorde !
Have I understood the Commissioner correctly in that this means you will not oppose general aid for transport between Ume√• and Vasa if tax-free shopping ceases on July 1 1999 ?
Sweden has made its position on the Common Foreign and Security Policy clear through its proposal , in conjunction with Finland , to the current Intergovernmental Conference .
The EU must not be allowed to develop a military organisation alongside the United Nations which competes with it .
The proposal for a common European military and civil corps is neither well thought out nor capable of implementation in practice .
Madam President , Mr Tindeman 's report makes a very constructive contribution to the debate on security policy and to its development .
Weakly developed co-operation in this area means that Europe 's contribution is becoming more and more fragmented and the opportunity for influence is being reduced .
Sweden has maintained an extensive defence organisation which has had a stabilising effect in Northern Europe .
Membership of the EU , participation in the PFF and association with the WEU will give those countries which have remained outside military alliances greater experience of participating in a co-operation with mutual obligations .
The new security policy conditions which have ruled since the end of the cold war have given rise to new debate even in Sweden .
Madam President , Mr Tindeman 's report is totally unrealistic !
To create a sham agreement in these circumstances can only mean that the voices of the smaller Member States will be hushed , they will be outvoted , and some countries will be turned into satellites of the super powers .
The United Nations , alone , is the people 's true forum in the work for peace and security .
The demand for weapons is thankfully no longer what is was before the Iron Curtain fell .
It is worth noting that increased co-ordination of defence material in Europe will , inevitably , lead to increased mutual dependency .
Article 223 needs to be revised and conditions created for common rules on export restrictions for European weapons , the implementation of which can be controlled .
Mr President , Mr Titley has written an important report .
The European weapon 's industry faces a huge challenge .
Equally the industry must , in the long term , operate under the same conditions as every other industry .
Modern military technology requires more and more expertise .
Without going into issues concerning universities , I would like to point out that much of the USA 's advantage in this respect stems from the fact that the universities there are open to competition in a totally different way from the enormous state Universities in Europe .
For defence material to be operational between defence powers there is a requirement that the material is made to the same level of quality .
We must be careful that we do not reach a state of specialisation which means that the USA supplies the machines , in other words the weapons and Europe supplies the people , by which we mean the soldiers .
It is easy to express support for Mr Titley 's proposal for an action programme to make the European weapons industry a more competitive force and to contribute to security in Europe in this way .
I could support the bulk of the report but there were certain details which I , as a representative of a neutral Scandinavian country , could not approve .
Yesterday I asked the same question of the Commission which maintained its refusal to publish this report .
My question is very tangible and consists of two parts
