European Union in the international negotiations on marine conservation : it is fundamental that by-catch techniques ( laying very long nets which end up killing non-target species such as cetaceans , seals , birds and turtles ) should be severely restricted on a worldwide scale .
Moreover , the idea that the lack of complete information is not an excuse for avoiding the adoption of precautionary measures (especially where the decline in biodiversity is beyond doubt ) is , if not applied blindly , a worthy principle for taking action .
.
Otherwise , there will be a risk of serious paralysis in the next few years , offset by last-minute liberality that is not consistent with ideas of rational and structural development .
The FAO has estimated the volume of fish discards within commercial fisheries at between 17.9 and 39.5 million tonnes per year , or between two and five times the EU 's fisheries production , which is quite unacceptable .
In an attempt to overcome 'differences' , it advocates the deepening of relations between the EU and the USA , mentioning the EU 's need to develop as a political and military bloc .
It is true that European measures such as the directive on trading emissions , aimed at reducing the cost of compliance with Kyoto , will help to reduce US resistance to the aforesaid Protocol .
I regret the utterly unnecessary and misplaced decision to include Section 5 , which advocates positions in relation to the workings of the Union 's foreign policy which do not correspond with those established in the Treaties and which do not deserve our support .
Mr President , another ten emigrants drowned yesterday while trying to reach Italy .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Thessaloniki European Council was dominated by the presentation of the draft Constitutional Treaty drawn up by the Convention .
It is worth saying that the text of the Convention was not a consensual one and nor could it have been .
The first is to note that , if the solution favoured by the Convention for the future of the Presidency of the European Council goes ahead , the Greek Presidency will remain inextricably linked to the beginning of the end of the excellent democratic practice , carried out every six months here in the European Parliament , of assessing the work of the Presidencies .
We are sorry , however , that this is the last time we will be able to pass on our congratulations to Greece in the same circumstances .
Instead , it represents a break , a highly creative shift in the European spirit .
Greece showed it could also contribute to that process of enlargement by proposing that the western Balkans join the European Union in the long term .
The art of politics in Greece cannot be separated from philosophy , just as the art of politics in Europe must not be separated from philosophy either , otherwise it will always be susceptible to the temptations of religious fundamentalism and repressive ideologies .
We do not believe that the aforesaid European Constitution can serve as a basis for the work of the Intergovernmental Conference scheduled for October .
I share the rapporteur 's position and give my express support to the promotion sought for the proposal for a directive on the adoption and promulgation of best laboratory practices and the verification of their applications for tests on chemical substances , to be achieved through harmonisation of laws , regulations and administrative provisions .
I voted with the rapporteur , in favour of adopting a European Parliament and Council decision on the continuing application of schemes approved in 2000 for a supplementary period of four years .
I must nevertheless congratulate the Council on its unanimous adoption of the common position in question .
Would you please correct my mistake ?
That is why Commissioner Liikanen 's observation left me troubled , more troubled than I already was .
There is a certain contradiction implied between these principles , although commenting on this is irrelevant at present .
In addition , I myself have just spent a month and a half in Argentina , on political business , and have seen the progress that the country has made .
There are peoples fleeing from war .
Mr President , Commissioner , it is no exaggeration , I feel , to state that tomorrow , when we approve the final version of the directive on emissions trading , we will have before us a new economic and environmental paradigm for the European Union : the carbon economy .
This agreement brings two great advantages : firstly , it avoids conciliation , and hence the possible postponement of the launch of the scheme from 2005 until 2006 ; secondly , although it does not incorporate all the amendments tabled by Parliament , the compromise that was reached includes our most important proposals .
Fourthly , auctioning may now constitute part of the process by which emission allowances are allocated after the end of the first period , though unfortunately in a non-harmonised way .
I feel , therefore , that the European emissions market has become more ambitious in environmental terms with this report .
There is a logic of constraint , stemming in particular from the Stability Pact , with which we are not in agreement , just as we are not in agreement with the systematic budget reductions made perfectly obvious by the rapporteur 's insistence on the restricted application of the 'N+2 ' rule .
If this Presidency is to be successful , the period of euroscepticism which only a little while ago led the Italian Government to voice reservations about the single currency must be completely left behind .
The directive also finds the provision for the competent authority to carry out on-site inspections to monitor compliance with the directive to be disproportionate
