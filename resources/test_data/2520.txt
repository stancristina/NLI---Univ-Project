a case in point .
The new company has announced its intention to initiate a restructuring plan with the aim of making savings .
This global restructuring plan could lead to the loss of up to 12 000 jobs .
In my region of the UK in particular the employment consequences of this merger have been severe as a result of ABB-Alsthom having announced that it was cutting 270 jobs in Britain with 95 jobs being lost in Stafford and 112 in Rugby .
The company ' s failure to inform the works council about the proposals for the merger is particularly worrying .
It is especially important in the case of large international companies where decisions are taken far from the employee .
Point 17 of the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers stresses the need for consultation , adding that this shall apply especially in companies having establishments in two or more Member States .
I do not think it is simply a matter of a Community charter .
EU legislation on this issue could not be clearer .
The Commission would do well in this sort of situation to make its decisions not simply on the basis of whether a merger will distort competition but also on the basis of the social and economic consequences .
We need more joined-up policy making on these issues .
What we also need urgently is an impact assessment study on the effect of merger in every situation .
This is the only way of respecting Article 127 of the Treaty .
I welcome the statement made by Commissioner Liikanen , but I also look for the support of this Parliament to ensure that the legislation which we have passed on workers ' rights is implemented rigorously and to ensure that impact assessments on the workforce for proposed mergers are undertaken as a matter of course .
Mr President , there are three points I wish to address .
The first is the inclusion of a legal base in the Treaty .
This is something I favour , but currently as part of a minority in my own Group .
We are all fully conscious of the importance of tourism , both to local economies and as a factor of European integration .
The problem for some of us , however , is the lack of specification of the extent of the legal base and of just how it would relate to considerations of subsidiarity .
Second , there are similar issues related to the establishment of a multiannual programme for tourism .
The resolution contains many excellent ideas for the promotion of different types of tourism and for its increasing professionalism .
At the same time the Commission is currently concerned about confining itself to core tasks .
The question has to be asked whether some of the activities suggested in the resolution might not put more pressure on its resources than is desirable .
Third , there are several references in the resolution to permanent employment .
Of course the promotion of this is desirable and permanent employment need not necessarily mean full-time employment .
But there will always be people who are looking for seasonal employment .
Students are an obvious example .
We have some concern that the resolution does not give enough consideration to them and to ways in which their interests could receive specific protection .
Thus , while complimenting Mr Viceconte on his report and finding a great deal in the resolution to commend , we shall be asking for a number of split votes to allow these concerns to be addressed .
First of all I should like to thank Mr Viceconte for all the work that he has done on this report .
It is a very extensive report .
We greatly welcome it , just as we welcomed the original report that it was based on , the report of the high-level working group which was set up by the European Commission .
I hope that the Commission will not forget that .
Having set it up , I hope the Commission actually makes use of it and therefore does not just allow it to sit around in the corridors and gather dust .
Tourism is basically small businesses and therefore a very fertile area for job creation .
As has already been said in this debate , three million potential new jobs within the next ten years is something well worth going for .
Europe can no longer refuse to give the recognition - both political and in terms of policy-making - that the fastest growing sector of its economy deserves because of its economic and social position .
We need a more dynamic vision based on tourism ' s contribution to job creation .
We must recognise a sector that is predominantly engaged in cross-border activity and therefore deserves a European policy with a stimulating , innovative and proactive approach to sustainable business development .
I know the Commissioner is very keen on information technology .
He has convinced me of that .
But his portfolio of information technology and tourism actually go very well together .
There are several reasons why the tourism industry is an ideal test-bed , therefore , for integrating job creation strategies .
Let us look at some of these reasons .
The importance to the economy of tourism and its growth potential is obviously one .
Various sectors of the population are employed by the tourism industry , particularly the more vulnerable groups , such as young people , women and the unskilled .
I am not saying that we do not need to raise the skills within the sector - of course we do - but let us get the jobs established first .
The availability of unskilled , temporary and seasonal work is very important in some of the economic areas of the Community .
