There has been a substantial variation in the velocity of circulation because of new developments within the financial services industry and this is merely another one of those .
Therefore , in the years before the ECB took charge of euro-zone monetary policy , the Bundesbank itself was not able to respect the growth of its money supply targets .
What we have here is an attempt , when we see that a particular theory of monetary control is not working and does not accord with reality , to squeeze that reality back into the theory , to the detriment of the innovatory capacity of the Member States and of their financial systems .
That is very regrettable .
There are a lot of safeguards that the Commission has put in here that the Council has carefully discussed and I very much hope that we will fully support the Council common position on this matter .
Mr President , as from January 1999 , the euro has been the new currency for most of the European Union .
Since then there have been no more exchange rate risks and , in theory , the cost to consumers of transferring money across borders and of changing cash from one euro-zone currency to another should have reduced sharply .
There are obligations on financial institutions within the Union to substantially reduce the cost to consumers of transferring money from one euro-zone to the other .
We may recall that the European Consumers ' Association , which represents the consumers of the European Union , carried out an extensive survey of charges for cross-border payments only last year .
The conclusion of that survey clearly demonstrated that costs for consumers of transferring money from one country to another in Europe are still too high .
With the forecast growth in electronic shopping over the next few years , heavy bank fees for money changes will be a serious disincentive for consumers to shop over the Internet .
It is important that consumers are reassured in relation to electronic payments by establishing a legal framework .
This survey also showed that consumers are still charged a lot more for making cross-border transfers than they are for making national transfers .
This does not make sense .
Euro currency has removed exchange rate risks and costs should have reduced substantially .
I welcome the directive on cross-border credit transfers which is now in force within the Union .
In conclusion , I strongly believe that the new directive on cross-border transfers is good news for the consumers of the Union .
It is also good news for financial institutions .
Mr President , like some of the previous speakers this evening , I am very pleased the Council came forward with this proposal .
I do not think that it will be helped by the amendments being proposed inside this Parliament today and indeed in our committee .
Whatever they say about having had to vote for the report as a whole at the end in the committee , it does not persuade me that some committee members did not also have concerns about the effects of some of those amendments .
Some of the opportunities of this nascent market , which we are now seeing emerge in the European Union , will be affected by some of the suggestions being made .
Whereas money supply , of course , is of very direct interest to any central bank , there is in this case no direct inference that it will have the effect that everyone suggests it will have , i .e . that e-money will be anything other than a means of exchange , a redeemable voucher if you like or a mechanism expected to be involved in trade .
Because of the very limits that Mr Huhne talked about , this is , of course , very closely controlled by the Council 's proposed waiver and particularly by some of the sensible compromises suggested earlier .
I personally , and the EPLP Group , could wholeheartedly support something like the compromise Amendment No 5 which Mrs Kauppi put forward in committee ; but I am afraid if Amendments Nos 3 and 4 were adopted here in Parliament this week , we would see this legislation fall .
Be in no doubt about that , this legislation would fall .
I would worry very seriously about the motives of the people who would like to see this legislation fall , because any vacuum which would be created would be a vacuum the European Central Bank would find itself eased into .
As an institution which has kept outside any form of regulation that is decided here or anywhere else , I find that a worrying idea .
Let me ask all comrades and colleagues around this room today to consider the effects of the amendments that could be passed this week , the damage they could cause , the lack of confidence that would surely emerge and the damage it would do to this nascent market .
Mr President , like everyone else in this debate I should like to congratulate Mr Lannoye .
He and I sometimes cross swords on the issue of other nutritious additives , but in this case we are looking very much at the essence of the burden of proof before this list is yet further extended .
He has done a service to the committee and also to this House by pointing out that this procedure appears to be almost always one-way .
We need to hear from the Commission on two points of principle : the first is whether the procedures themselves need review as the Commission spokesman suggested in the debate in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy ; secondly , whether there is a more efficacious way of removing additives as
