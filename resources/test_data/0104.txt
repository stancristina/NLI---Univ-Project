However , it should be noted that Regulation 1082/2006 was adopted in July 2006 , one year after it was adopted unanimously by the European Parliament on a proposal from our colleague Jan Olbrycht , and has been binding in all Member States since 1 August 2007 .
First of all I should mention the good work done by Mr Guidoni , which includes many of our proposals .
I feel the points of debate we had here were satisfactorily resolved by the dual concept of customs representation rights and the Authorised Economic Operator : the idea of two concepts that are theoretically different but can find common ground for harmonisation .
Parliament may intervene in an increasingly effective fashion in the creation of provisions for the customs code .
They need to be , because education is the millennium objective which these countries are furthest from achieving .
In this respect , especially in the field of science and technology , there is still a long way to go , because work has been done in other fields such as health , education , etc. , but there has not been a great deal of work done in the field of science and technology .
With the Republic of South Africa , for example , there has been an agreement on scientific and technological cooperation for ten years .
Another important area of scientific cooperation with South Africa and the whole of Africa in general that should be highlighted is that on AIDS , a disease that is ravaging the continent and which , in a country like South Africa , has reduced life expectancy by more than 10 years .
For this , however , the international community must be fully committed , and the UN mandate renewed , as some countries have suggested .
Both Laurent Nkunda 's rebel troops and the soldiers fighting in the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda are responsible for all this .
The structure of the merger may endanger that privacy , yet the national authorities do not have the capacity to know how those data are being manipulated , and neither will consumers know where their data are going or how they are being used by third parties . on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( ES ) Madam President , Commissioner , Minister , a dynamic and healthy financial sector is crucial for the stability of the European economy and for global competitiveness .
Free competition prohibits State aid as a way of promoting the private economy ; and taxation of savings should not be a gateway for distorting equal competition .
I therefore welcome the commitment of the Slovenian Presidency to conclude this process of transforming the Code into a common position during its mandate , although I recall , too , that previous presidencies made the same promise to no avail .
Here , it is recommended once again that for the most part alternative sentences should be chosen over imprisonment .
What he failed to say was that they execute any homosexuals there are there .
To that end all that needs to be done is to comply with Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights under which expulsion and extradition of persons to countries where there is a high risk of their being subjected to persecution , torture or even the death penalty , is prohibited .
The European Union needs to exert as much pressure as possible so that Syria and Iran cease to hinder the resolution of the political conflict in Lebanon and support the Arab League 's proposal on the election of a new President .
We therefore especially welcome this initiative . on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - ( ES ) Mr President , Mr Diamandouros , the Greens want to strengthen the institution of Ombudsman in order to increase public confidence in the European institutions .
I am confident that this time the actual powers of the Ombudsman have finally been clarified , and that we have genuinely created a means of increasing the confidence of the man in the street in the European institutions . on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( ES ) Mr President , Commissioner , it is eight months since the shipwreck of the New Flame and there is still a risk of further oil spills , especially oil emanating from the cargo contained in the wreck .
If so , Mr Barrot , if there has been a breach of Community law , please give this House an undertaking that you will refer those infringements to the Court of Justice of the European Communities , because when all is said and done it is always citizens and the environment who pay . on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - ( ES ) Mr President , I think that this New Flame situation was best summed up by Greenpeace when it planted a banner on the wreck bearing the slogan 'vertido diplom√°tico ' - diplomatic spillage .
This means greater social responsibility for the project .
Finally , even though we know that the general financial aid that is allocated to ACP countries is primarily focused on strategies to eradicate poverty , it would not be superfluous to ensure that the final objective of the EFD was the same . on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( ES ) Mr President , a community such as the Latin-Caribbean community , whose entire population on the American continent resembles our own , whom we can speak to in its own languages - Portuguese , French and Spanish , among others - merits special consideration and treatment by the European institutions .
Nobody entertains any doubts , in my opinion , as to the importance of
