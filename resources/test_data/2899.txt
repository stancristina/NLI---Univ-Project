will also vote against and , secondly , it will send out a crucial signal to the summits in Feira and Nice to the effect that one ought to be guided by the terrain , which is more important than the ideological map .
The words of the English text , which I understand to be the basic text , are : "asked the Council presidency " .
This is a serious political and translation error .
I would urge that a correct Danish translation of the text be obtained , for I find it a very serious matter that , in point 8 concerning Austria , these two mistakes have been made which , from a political point of view , completely alter the sense .
- ( DA ) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted neither for nor against the joint resolution concerning preparations for the European Council in Feira on 19 and 20 June 2000 .
However , the resolution also contains a long section about the current Intergovernmental Conference and , in this connection , we should like to repeat that our vote in favour of the overall resolution does not alter our basic view that extending the agenda and turning the Treaty into a constitution , with the Charter of Fundamental Rights incorporated into it with binding legal effect , will not enhance the possibility of achieving a satisfactory result in Nice in December , something which is absolutely crucial if the enlargement is to be able to go ahead once the countries concerned are ready .
- ( DA ) We are voting against the overall resolution , which emphasises the desire to develop a military dimension to EU cooperation .
We cannot support the general approach of the text , which acknowledges the need for a militarisation of the EU' s cooperation on defence and in that way fails to respect the non-aligned countries of the Union .
We can support the need to draw up a common code of conduct for arms dealing between Member States and between Member States and third countries , but we cannot support the creation of an internal market for the armaments industry , as also proposed in the resolution .
- ( DA ) The Danish Social Democrats support the proposal for a European defence and security policy , which is to be discussed at the Feira Summit in Portugal in June 2000 .
There are , nonetheless , a couple of areas where the Danish Social Democrats believe that care ought to be exercised .
We are uneasy about the European Parliament ' s influence in this area , for we believe that defence and security policy is predominantly an intergovernmental matter .
We see no reason for extending majority decision-making into this area .
There is no need to increase the overall European defence budgets .
We would also refer to the Danish reservation concerning common action in the defence sphere .
It was successful and a victory for justice and human rights .
At that time , the Serbs had already driven 200 000 to 300 000 people from their homes and had ravaged and laid waste whole areas of the country .
I can also testify to the incredibly efficient work being done by KFOR , the UN mission ( UNMIK ) and the UNMIK police .
Now , it is the Serbs who need our attention .
The EU countries , in particular , have gone back on their promise .
That is partly why the former liberation organisation , the KLA is all too easily able to engage in anti-Serbian and criminal activities , which presumably also include murder , arson and attempts to drive people from their homes .
So , what is now needed may be expressed as succinctly as a year ago : the objective is to get the KLA out , the police in and the Serbs home to those places in which they have always lived in Kosovo .
The KLA must be disarmed and stripped of any monopoly position in the coming election campaign .
The KLA ' s criminal activity must be brought to an end .
The Serbs must be helped to return home .
In turn , it must be absolutely clear that the election planned for October in Kosovo must be held , irrespective of whether the Kosovan Serbs boycott it , for what are especially needed are Albanians , who are accountable .
What we need is to arrange for the Albanian majority to be held accountable .
Madam President , I think that what is missing is a comment on the football match between Italy and France .
Mr President , in the EU , matters are so often on the agenda that it is difficult to say when the various developments begin .
The precedence of EU law may be dated back to the judgements given in 1962 and 1964 .
The changeover to majority voting may be dated back to the Council of Ministers ' new rules of procedure from July 1987 and the Single European Act ' s majority provisions for the internal market .
With the Feira Summit , the EU' s Member States acknowledged for the first time that closer cooperation could take place without the agreement of every country .
It is too early to say whether the outcome will be a general clause or whether earmarking will be introduced , but the initial breakthrough has occurred , and the principle of equality between countries has in that way been abandoned .
Formally , changes to the Treaties will still require unanimity but , in reality , it will soon be possible to increase cooperation without waiting for the stragglers .
I also believe that the sanctions against Austria ought to be lifted , and preferably sooner rather than later .
