itself .     .
It marks the beginning of a new phase in the EU’s relations with Albania and creates a new framework for partnership in a wide range of fields .
Aligning Albanian laws with those of the EU will bring Albania closer to European standards and help further strengthen the ties between us .
The SAA sets up joint structures to foster dialogue and monitor progress , including a parliamentary committee .
This committee will be able to take forward the good work of the current Joint Parliamentary Committee and will provide an important opportunity to guide Albania in the best traditions of European parliamentary democracy .
It is important to take this into account as Albania pursues its European route .
We welcome the recommendations of the Committee on International Trade on improving Albania’s business environment , which is vital to enable Albania to make full use of the agreement .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , firstly I am very glad that there is strong and broad commitment within all the Union’s institutions , including Parliament , to the Western Balkans ’ European perspective .
It is one thing to draft legislation , but it is quite another to implement it , not to speak of cultural change , which normally takes even longer .
It has to be said once again that the Council is expecting Albania to step up measures , especially with regard to promoting freedom of the media , the return of property and compensation being paid , improved administration , the protection of minorities , and ensuring that local elections are held in accordance with international norms .
It is mainly Albania which holds the keys to the solution .     .
I agree with the rapporteur , Mr Ilves , that this provides Albania with a golden opportunity to reform the country in line with the rule of law and all democratic principles .
I take this as a sign of the increased maturity of Albania’s political culture , and this must be pursued further in the future .
We have reiterated that reform discussions should take into account the recommendations of the OSCE’s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights , following last year’s parliamentary election .
I agree fully with Mr Hatzidakis that the Stabilisation and Association Agreement helps us to coach the country towards European standards as regards electoral reform .
On behalf of the Commission and the Union , I have made it clear to Albania’s political leadership and to the general public of that country that a sustained track record of successful implementation of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement , as well as a tangible track record of reforms and their implementation on the ground , must be established over time before any consideration of further formal steps towards the European Union is possible .
The Government of Albania has demonstrated a strong will to make serious progress in that field .
I am very glad that the European Parliament has invested a lot of time and energy in monitoring and pursuing political dialogue with Albania .
The Commission made its proposals for the negotiating mandates for the Western Balkans on visa facilitation in July .
I am very glad that the Finnish Presidency intends to secure the adoption of those mandates before the end of this year .
It would be good for civil society and business – particularly small and medium-sized enterprises – and for students , researchers and all citizens .
This is a real opportunity , as many here today have said .
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the President-in-Office of the Council , Finnish Foreign Minister Tuomioja , and to acknowledge the role he has played , because his experience and expertise have played an important role in finding this ‘one voice’ .
Mr President , I am convinced that we will gain fairly unanimous support for this broadly-based conference .
This will be vital for achieving a lasting peace in the region .
Now , however , we need the courage and determination to seize this opportunity to genuinely bring lasting peace to the region .     .
It is very important and meaningful that the European Union , that is to say the Commission and the Member States together , should be committed to providing Lebanon with massive volumes of economic aid in this crisis right from the start , both in terms of emergency humanitarian relief aid and early recovery , which is now under way , as well as longer-term reconstruction .
The reconstruction process also needs a thorough needs analysis , and the Union will collaborate with Lebanon on this .
Following the tremendous efforts of the Austrian Presidency preceding us , it is one of the main aims of the Finnish Presidency to reach agreement on the Working Time Directive .
The directive quickly needs to find a jointly agreed solution in order to comply with the judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Communities in the SIMAP and Jager cases .
The Temporary Agency Workers Directive is another complex and politically delicate issue .
The Council believes that these objectives can be achieved in such a way that the different practices and traditions that obtain in national labour markets are respected .
Up till now there have been two distinct views on the matter , so it has not been worth putting this issue on the agenda of future meetings of the Council .
We will be aware of the general opinion on this when the vote on the first reading of the Services Directive is voted on .
If the Commission delivers its vital input with regard to this matter during our Presidency , we will be ready to undertake some constructive work to find a solution that is acceptable to all the Member States .
