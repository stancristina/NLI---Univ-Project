You are promising future directives and perhaps you could tell me when these future directives will materialise .
You know that , for the time being , no solution to the problem of waste management has been found , that there are currently no techniques which will enable us to reduce the radioactivity of radioactive nuclear waste .
It is in the interest of everyone to make a lasting success of enlargement , but the cost that this will certainly entail cannot be , as is the case at the moment , according to current plans , around 0.08 % of the fifteen Member States ' GDP for each of the first three years .
Do you want to lose out substantially in the new division of powers on which the Convention is working , that you would otherwise not be able to achieve ?
Could it really have done anything else , however , without sparking a crisis , or even a disaster ?
I stress the words 'in the long run ' .
This is the only way to encourage the development of the rural pillar that is so badly needed , by means of compulsory modulation .
As far as Chechnya and our relations with Russia are concerned , we have just heard Mr Prodi express his commitment , and we are asking you , Mr Solana , to speak on our behalf and , I am sure , on behalf of the entire House , and condemn in the strongest possible terms the cowardly and criminal act of terrorism which took place in Moscow .

We need firm initiatives which can demonstrate to the world , and more importantly to the peoples of the region , a political , clear will , encouraging the supporters of peace to take action .
The Palestinians fear occupation by the Israeli army .
Disregarding the debate which is currently going on in the Security Council , the preparations therefore continue with regard to Iraq .
Well , I shall tell you : we will continue to say that Iraq is concealing weapons of mass destruction .
As for the elections in Israel , I perceive them to be more of a cause for concern than a source of hope .
First and foremost , its aim is to reiterate the fundamental principles of the common agricultural policy , in particular financial solidarity , the need for a fair income for producers and the maintenance of border protection in order to prevent distortions of competition .
The Commissioner reminded us of all this within the Committee on Agriculture at our meeting of 5 October and the European Commission should soon submit legislative measures which will have to comply with all of these restrictions .
We do not want to believe that what has been discussed , in particular with regard to the mid-term review , might be called into question and become obsolete , because the representatives of the Council have a variety of interests .
President-in-Office of the Council , your comments have indeed been extremely soothing , but they will not suffice to anaesthetise us .
We have chosen diversified agriculture and a production model that favours quality and environmental protection .
I believe there are four particularly important principles .
For now , Mr President , this is far from the reality .
All these steps shared the aim of normalising the situation in North Korea through constructive dialogue .
Following this disaster , eight Northern European countries , seven EU countries and Norway , worked together to adopt stricter standards than those in the 1990 agreement in order to prevent ships from capsizing .
Having said that , a great deal still remains to be done .
The Union must show ambition for the sake of all its citizens when it comes to showing that it is an area of solidarity .
I shall confine myself here to making two general comments .
In fact , regulatory stability and the maintenance of income policy guarantee investment choices and the continued operation of farms and agricultural businesses .
Lastly , it should be pointed out that cross-border policy not only brings together different nations , but sometimes also brings together fragments of the same nation that have been unjustly separated .
In this area as well , state aid is obviously important and we must highlight and maintain it .
That is why the Commission should carry out a thorough assessment of the media situation in each candidate country and in each Member State .
Tobacco , which kills hundreds of Europeans every day , is a scourge that we must combat in the name of protecting the health of our fellow citizens .
I would simply like to add to what Mrs Berger said .
At the present time , these cross-sector financial groups are not adequately regulated by current legislation .
Even a vote by the European Parliament cannot turn an insipid recommendation into a magic potion to ward off the evils of capitalism .
The third principle proposes to retain flexible , reversible management instruments such as TACs and quotas , so that the fishing effort can be adjusted to match the state of resources , in preference to rigid instruments that have an irreversible and socially dramatic impact such as the scrapping of vessels .
What struck me is that the proposal by the European Commission on the roadmap on reform of the common agricultural policy reflects the lack of priority that the latter gives to the social impact of its plan since this impact only features in seventh place in the list of proposed measures .
We also know , however , that the transition , or rather the process of transforming the economies of the countries concerned , will take much longer .
I would ask you to forward this complaint to Parliament 's Presidency .
I
