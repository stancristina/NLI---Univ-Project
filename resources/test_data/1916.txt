of view , it is difficult to maintain that isolated cases of droughts are directly connected to climate change ; nonetheless , we know that climate change contributes to more severe phenomena which are manifesting more and more regularly and over larger geographical areas .
In this way it sent a political message well beyond its territory .
The aim of this cooperation is to facilitate the application of policies of proper administration of water resources in the Mediterranean countries , by adhering to the principles of the Community Water Framework Directive .
Monitoring SMAP actions forms part of the programme and there are reports available for most of these actions .
The next generation of the SΜΑΡ programme , SΜΑΡ 3 , will focus on the preparation of overall coastal zone management plans and will make provision for technical assistance to be provided to the Member States ' governments .
Basically , they are : the Cohesion Fund , the Regional Development Fund , the Rural Development Fund and so forth .
Indeed , the European Environment Agency , in a report which it filed two months ago , noted and emphasised that environmental priorities for the Mediterranean area include drought and the prevention and management of drought situations and water shortages , which hit countries such as Portugal and Spain in particular this year .
I must also stress that the Environment Agency emphasised in its report the importance of other emergent threats in the area of the Mediterranean , especially for ecosystems , from changes in temperatures and rainfall in the area , which have various consequences .     – Commissioner , your reply satisfies me completely .
The ruling by the Court of Justice perhaps highlights rather than deals with the problem .
I ask you again : what does the Commission intend to do in order to limit tax evasion by large multinational groups and stem the loss of public revenue to the Member States ?
I think that concern about the question of transparency of public procurement and public defence is an issue which preoccupies the European economy in general , but I shall bear in mind the Commissioner 's explanation that he will clarify the derogations from Article 296 of the Treaty on the basis of the relevant decision by the Court of Justice , especially the stage of the procedure during which public arms procurement contracts are awarded .
Unfortunately , the first demonstrations have already started in my country .
Besides , we owe it to the environment , because energy crops mean that we are protecting the environment , although the ACP countries will not fare better in the future under the new regime .
Otherwise , in many disadvantaged areas of Europe we shall see farming disappear , villages abandoned and the ecological deterioration of Europe .
It is worth noting that , following the directives on access to environmental information and public participation , this proposal for a regulation is the third legislative proposal in succession on the application of the Århus Convention , this time to the Community institutions , and Mrs Korhola has made a valuable contribution .
The Community became a contracting party to the Convention in May 2005 , just before the second conference of the parties in Almaty .
To be specific , as far as access to environmental information is concerned , a new Article 6 is proposed which refers to the application of the exemptions relating to access to environmental information , as proposed in the European Parliament 's amendment .
The Commission is in a position to accept the changes in question , given that the current wording retains the obligation of the organisations in question to have environmental protection at Community level as their basic objective .
I hope that agreement will soon be reached on this specific proposal .
This will quickly smooth out the problems of bureaucracy which have to date been the basic brake on all similar endeavours .
I would like to thank the speakers this evening for their very important speeches .
The specific amendments by the European Parliament could bring about , as a corollary , the creation of two , partially overlapping regimes of access to documents , which would not help transparency and legal clarity .
Similarly , access procedures are not environmental information per se .
Nonetheless , it should be noted that it is the Commission 's practice to publish on its website information relating to access procedures for all policy sectors .
The Århus Convention encourages public participation in the preliminary preparation of policies within the framework of a best effort clause .
The Commission cannot accept there is a need to call for public participation for plans and programmes funded by Community institutions , as provided for in Amendment 8.
It can also accept Amendment 20 adding the obligation of the Community institution to take account of the results of public participation .
The recognition of a special regime for environmental non-governmental organisations , the basic object of which is to defend environmental interests , is perfectly in keeping with the spirit of the Århus Convention .
Finally , Amendments 22 , 24 and 25 refer to the outcome of the internal review of administrative acts adopted by the Community institutions in accordance with Article 10 and how they relate to the provisions on access to the Court of Justice in accordance with Article 12 .
I should like to thank the European Parliament teams which took part in the conciliation meeting with the Council on 6 December 2005 .
I should like to thank the delegation of the European Parliament which took part in the conciliation meeting with the Council on 12 October 2005 , and vice-president Mr Trakatellis and the rapporteur Mr Maaten in particular , and to congratulate them on their outstanding work and on the result achieved .
