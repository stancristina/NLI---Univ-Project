The Commission has difficulties here , because the countries affected are not expressing their agreement .
I would insist that the Commission has no problem but that we need the agreement of the States in question .
Naturally , the Commission will accept what the countries affected say in the Council , because we cannot go against their opinion .
Ladies and gentlemen , certain amendments propose withdrawing or removing parts already integrated within the proposals of the Commission 's Van Miert group and approved by the Council .
I would ask Parliament to understand that this margin for flexibility exists , but that it is impossible to entirely reconsider the fundamental points and the whole range of proposals for these new trans-European networks , which we must approve urgently so that , from 1 May 2004 , when we are 25 countries rather than 15 , the ten new Member States are included in them , since they will be part of the Union as a whole .
I would like you to tell us what word we should use so that we can really receive an answer to what we are asking .
I would like firstly to say that I am delighted that we have reached the second reading under the best possible circumstances in relation to such an important proposal , which must protect the position of our air sector , although it is absolutely correct to say that under no circumstances must it be used to restrict competition or the entry of third countries into our sector , but rather quite the opposite .
In this regard , the Commission entirely agrees with the objectives of this amendment .
It is an extremely important regulation as we saw after 11 September , when our air companies were stretched to their limits and had to respond with the support of the public sector .
At the same time , with regard to the damage caused by war and terrorism , it makes the insurance requirements for certain aircraft subject to the principle of subsidiarity .
Talking now on my own personal behalf , I would like to say the following : in the explanatory statement , the rapporteur acknowledges that the extension of the agreement , and I quote , ‘comes at a politically critical time in which the Middle East peace process is floundering’ .
No more bombs .
In its judgment , the Court established , on the one hand , the non-exportability of the benefits in question and , on the other , the obligation of the new State of residence to grant benefits in its territory .
The Commission , however , cannot accept Amendments Nos 4 to 8 , whose objective is to exclude two Dutch benefits from Annex IIa : that for unfitness for work for young disabled people and supplementary sums or minimum incomes for receivers of social benefits .
Allow me also to express my deepest disdain for this vermin in human form and above all affection and solidarity with the families suffering today ; solidarity and affection in their pain and suffering .
I cannot agree with Amendments Nos 9 to 12 ; firstly because they involve family benefits in all cases .
As I said earlier , we must return to our work and I am going to try to respond to your concerns .
There may be an intermediate way – which is being worked on and on which we may make progress – mutual recognition , which would not lead to a situation of complete harmonisation , but to a situation of recognition which could allow us to solve some of the problems .
I therefore believe that there is no gap in the legislation , there is coherence throughout the system , which does not imply that no specific problems will arise or that we will not have to try to resolve them .
We will base this on previous experience because we believe it is essential to provide assistance in this area , which is key both in order to confront the problems of demographic ageing in our countries and in order to maintain high and appropriate levels of social protection .
In order to achieve the best results , it is essential that indicators receive strong support from this working programme .
We will always remember – and this is an essential point – that primary responsibility on these issues falls to the Member States , particularly in relation to health and care for the chronically ill .
Naturally , the three great objectives we need to achieve are : universal accessibility regardless of the economic situation of each person , high-quality health care and the long-term sustainability of health care systems .
I would like to make just two comments .
Mr President , the Commission is in agreement with the oral amendment proposed .     Mr President , we are going to vote on a resolution in paragraph 4 of which we state our support for and solidarity with the victims of terrorism and their families .
Please let us vote on the amendment and let us not turn something which was a gesture into an absurd and out-of-place discussion .     .
His appointment is an important milestone in the initiative of CARICOM and should open the way to a constitutional solution to the current difficulties facing the country , provided that the necessary measures are adopted to break the cycle of violence and establish a climate of security in Haiti .
Secondly , with regard to the possibility of using funds from the eighth EDF , the Union has made the normalisation of relations conditional upon compliance with the necessary conditions and measures laid down in the resolutions of the Organisation of American States and that is the direction we are continuing to work in .
