wish this basis to remain in place .
I am not therefore in favour of this report as it at present stands .
We believe that the decriminalisation or legalisation of so-called soft drugs would be downright harmful because soft drugs lead to the use of harder drugs .
It is therefore not acceptable to tear up our international conventions dedicated to prevention and to promoting a sensible drugs policy .
Mr President , as a Finnish liberal , I support Mr Olle Schmidt 's policy .
We ask ourselves what it is that attracts young people to the drugs trade .
They have hope .
Mrs Buitenweg 's report urges a review of the UN conventions and the reclassification of drugs .
It is only when the explanatory statement is studied that it is apparent that we are in actual fact concerned here with the legalisation of cannabis and that the long-term aim is to legalise all drugs .
We are concerned here not only with methadone and needle exchange programmes but also with what is termed the safer use of drugs , as if there were any such thing .
The EU is making important efforts to combat the drugs trade .
Secondly , let issues of care and treatment remain national competences .
Is the Netherlands an example to the rest of Europe ?
What support do you offer his or her father , Mr De Rossa and Mr Evans ?
There are so many different concepts floating about .
Put yourselves in the shoes of a real family , and imagine the message that is being sent out to the children and teenagers .
My question to the rapporteur , Mrs Buitenweg , concerns the way in which she imagines Dutch policy to protect children 's rights and to strengthen the position of Dutch parents in telling their children , both younger and older , to resist drugs , including cannabis .
Does this mean that you want culturally accepted drug use to extend to include cannabis ?
I wish to begin by addressing sincere thanks to the Commissioners .
My second question concerns what Commissioner Diamantopoulou mentioned regarding older workers .
Growth , employment and social welfare belong together .
So that we might make better use of the work force , what , in practical terms , do you propose when it comes to lifelong learning and quality in the workplace ?
What , in practical terms , is being done at European level ?
I want to state that I did not receive the final wording of the guidelines until a few minutes ago when I came down to the Chamber just before 5 p.m.
I want instead to address a political issue that I believe to be a major issue .
How is this contradiction to be resolved between this pressure to reduce costs and the demands for quality ?
This is clearly a cross-border problem .
We can only promise that we shall do everything we can to ensure that the work produces good results .
For the first time , we are uniting almost the whole of the continent by peaceful means - through agreements , compromises and treaties , rather than through war and conquest .
It is an historic day too for the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party .
We shall be pleased to welcome our friends as fellow MEPs in order to be able to work together with them for a better future for the people of Europe .
Despite the fact that matters may be rather chaotic to begin with , something extremely good will emerge if we only have patience .
I want to thank those fellow MEPs who have enabled us to find a solution .
Despite the fact that we are all voting 'yes ' today , we are not uncritical .
We take it for granted that all the candidate countries will use the time remaining before they become full members to tackle environmental issues , to work on improving legal certainty and the protection of minorities , to fight corruption more effectively and to make efforts to combat the high incidence of human trafficking .
Mr President , now that the European Union is to be enlarged by ten new Member States , it is not only an historic moment for the EU , it is a fact that also raises the issue of what our common core values are .
I venture to state before this Parliament that our common core values in actual fact found expression through the way in which Communism and dictatorship in the former Eastern European countries were done away with .
These core values are indispensable to our joint construction of an EU that is to be enlarged to include 25 Member States .
We must not forget Cyprus , and we must realise the absolute necessity of Turkish troops ' withdrawing from northern Cyprus if the Helsinki decision on Turkey 's candidacy is to become a reality .
Let there be an end to this .
General Morillon wants the EU to do the same as the United States did in Kosovo or perhaps Iraq or some other small country against which the United States waged a war of aggression in the last hundred years .
If the EU goes down General Morillon 's Roman road , it is possible that an EU President might , one fine day , discuss on an equal footing with the US President which particular paupers in which particular developing country , rich in oil and minerals , are the next to be bombed back to the Stone Age .
If General Morillon gets his way , we should do well to take Oswald Spengler 's ' The Decline of the West ' down from the book shelves in order to understand what will happen .
