It is a thorough and thought-provoking report which raises important questions .
The agency is indeed a success story .
That is certainly our approach .
The shift I have mentioned above applies to the countries with deconcentrated delegations , as well as those where the agency is operating .
We do not see a need to extend the agency 's territorial competence further .
Our preliminary thoughts are as follows .
But we cannot give a clear answer at this point .
There is no way of acquiring this other than having nationality one of the Member States .
Second : the lack of information .
We must adopt the measures needed to further raise voter awareness of the importance of these elections .
The Member States must adopt all the measures needed to ensure that fundamental rights are respected , the protection of the citizens against terrorism and organised crime , support and compensation for victims , and to ensure the effective and equitable access of European citizens to justice .
With regard to barriers that still remain , the action plan for mobility must be adopted as a matter of urgency , so as to facilitate and enhance the mobility of students , volunteers , teachers and trainers .
First , the Charter of Fundamental Rights .
Nevertheless , the development of a genuine European citizenship requires more , both with regard to those rights already enshrined in the Treaties , but whose full implementation today still faces too many obstacles , and with regard to the integration of the future institutional model of the Union , which is undoubtedly the great challenge currently facing our community of peoples and countries .
We urge the Council rapidly to adopt this proposal and thereby end the existing discrimination and to ensure that these persons can , in the field of employment , education and social security , enjoy rights close to those held by citizens of the Union .
Mr Coelho 's report is the necessary and appropriate complement to the third Commission report , giving it a crucial political meaning that is well expressed in the motion for a resolution , on which we shall be voting tomorrow .
The real state of European citizenship - as demonstrated , for example , in the symptomatic low levels of electoral participation - shows , as the motion for a resolution points out and emphasises in line with the Treaty , that ' European citizenship shall not replace national citizenship , but complements and expands it ' .
When we distance ourselves from this goal , however , because we want to continue sleeping easy , we shall be opening the way to nightmares and to creating points of conflict , tension and disillusionment that will undermine the European project .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am delighted to have the opportunity today to discuss the issue of citizenship of the Union with you , precisely at a time when we are celebrating the tenth anniversary of its creation .
I shall take this opportunity to express my thanks for the report that has been presented today on the Third Commission Report on Citizenship of the Union and I should like , in particular , to congratulate the rapporteur , Carlos Coelho , not only on the quality of his report , but also on the way in which he structured the issue and on the clarity of the political objectives that he has attached to it .
This observation made by the rapporteur is shared by the Commission , whose report repeatedly highlights the need to better inform the citizens on the rights to which they are entitled .
Since 1998 this service has provided information on a whole range of matters concerning the European Union , thereby contributing to people knowing their rights and opportunities as citizens of the Union and knowing how to take advantage of them .
This caused - I admit - some delay in meeting the initial deadline for submitting the third report , but I think that the importance of the Charter fully justified this .
I also hope that the Council is able to approve the Commission proposal on reorganising the right to freedom of movement .
Therefore it is an honour for me to participate in this debate on her behalf .
The Commission will present the remaining proposals , notably on access to justice and the application of the convention to Community institutions , by the end of the year .
Under the Aarhus Convention , public participation is as a rule required , not only for the issue but also for the updating of permits for the activities covered .
The Commission considers public participation in permit updates covered by Article 13 appropriate .
In addition , public participation in the preparation of legislation is referred to as soft law under the Aarhus Convention .
I turn now to access to justice .
However , the Commission is preparing a legislative proposal on access to justice to fully implement the third pillar of the Aarhus Convention .
The Commission therefore cannot accept those amendments .
Although this report contains some positive aspects in terms of its intentions , it also makes some misguided proposals , which arise from a largely economic view of the system .
The main reason for our voting against this joint resolution is the approval of parts of the resolution that seek to justify war and US intervention in Afghanistan , a situation which is all the more serious because of all of the US pressure for a new war against Iraq .
Secondly , account must be taken of already existing structures and available awareness-raising instruments , such as the European judicial network and the European civil and commercial network , must be fully exploited .
In the working paper that the Commission presented on the ' European Judicial Training Network ? we advocated three possible options :
