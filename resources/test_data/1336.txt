Criminal justice is the most hotly debated area of human rights – its reciprocal nature , its conflicts and the fact that it is based on a principle of essential dignity .
The harmonisation of the criminal justice system must not therefore be done half-heartedly , nor must it be merely the basis for mutual recognition of judicial decisions ; it should be an end in itself .
I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for the spirit of cooperation that led to consensus on almost all of the amendments that I tabled as shadow rapporteur and on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament .
It is a means whereby in this sector , in common with other essential supplies , the consumer enjoys the best possible conditions in terms of price , quality and universality , because those consumers are citizens , first and foremost .
Unfortunately , the perspectives that have been set out for the 8 March ECOFIN Council will mean more of the same when they come to be implemented .
The funding specifically earmarked for the programme is expected to help to highlight its role as a European city and as a cultural hub .
I endorse the report by Mr Di Pietro , which supports and seeks to strengthen the Commission ’s initiative aimed at making improvements of a technical nature to the legislation relating to the exchange of information extracted from the criminal record , and suggests practical ways of remedying the shortcomings in the current systems , which are based on the 1959 Council of Europe Convention .
Without prejudice to the various Member States fully exercising their sovereignty , it is widely acknowledged nowadays that different countries must work together to fight crime .
Similarly , Member States are hesitant to allow their nationals , and even mere residents in their countries , to be tried by other Member States .
Consequently , I feel that a vote in favour of this report is justified .     .
I therefore voted in favour of this report .     .
I should also like to highlight that there are other services of general economic interest of importance to the outermost regions , such as postal services and telecommunications .
The problem arises when a good idea , an obviously welcome political initiative , is undermined by the temptation to regulate .
I shall conclude by saying that the most significant of the four European freedoms is freedom of movement .     – Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to join in the words of congratulation for Mrs Attwooll on her excellent report .
My second major concern is that this agency should not mean that Community policies are at the mercy of power play and vested interests , because the outright losers in such situations tend to be the smallest regions , along with sustainable fishing itself .     – Mr President , I , too , was naturally pleased with Commissioner Borg’s positive response to the clear issue that our committee and , in particular , our chair , have brought before this House at a most opportune moment .
There can be no sustainable fishing without respect for nature and this is perhaps the greatest demonstration of the negative side of our common fisheries policy .
This is a practical demonstration of an attitude that flies in the face of what was said earlier , because before we speak at the FAO , I believe it essential that we ensure good practice within the EU.     . – Mr President , I should like to point out three areas in which the Commissioner’s statements struck me as vague or imprecise .
Europe has everything to gain from being clear on this matter .
This is the only way in which we will be able to condemn , for example , the appalling conditions suffered by the thousands of Sudanese treated as slaves in Libya .
In the Middle East , EUR 60 billion is spent every year on arms and cutting this amount by half will release absolutely crucial funds to support development throughout the region .
Development and joint initiatives are absolutely crucial , in areas such as water , energy , transport , infrastructures and tourism , to enable social progress and economic and regional integration .
Human rights culture is rooted in the fight against authoritarianism , totalitarianism and dictatorships , and there must be no let-up in this fight .
Lastly , there is a new reality that threatens human rights and that is international crime .
Like the other agreements that have already been concluded , this one gives further proof that the EU’s traditional partners have taken a positive view of the enlargement , a sign that Europe is now an increasingly relevant political entity .
I feel that they will constitute another positive step in the Euro-Mediterranean partnership .
Accordingly , the aim is to tighten up security around goods crossing international borders .
Beginning with the key elements , it strikes me that there is potential conflict in the Council seeking to authorise the Member States to do what , in France’s case , they have already done , particularly in an area in which there is no clear guidance as to whether this power rests with the Community or forms part of the exceptions enshrined in the Treaty .
I therefore voted in favour of the report , with the reservations that I have mentioned .     .
Portugal has already taken steps in this direction , with the introduction of measures into labour legislation under the heading of continuing lifelong learning for workers and companies .
In the EU of 15 , only 8.5 % of European citizens enjoyed this professional benefit .
Promoting training for our workers and investing in their lifelong employability are sustainable ways of achieving greater competitiveness in the European economy .     .
Furthermore , we are still waiting for
