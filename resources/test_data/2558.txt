if you wish , you can answer us .
What is the European Commission 's position on this ?
I am asking because there has been very heavy rainfall in Athens over the past two days , coupled with a strike by refuse collectors , and the huge volume of rubbish to which this directive applies has blocked all the drains and the town has flooded .
When , roughly , will the volume of rubbish start decreasing and a different sort of policy - a recycling and recovery policy - be introduced ?
If you subsidise the takeover of quotas by other producers , obviously the producers who take over this production potential need some time to amortise their investment , about 7 or 8 years .
Quite right too and we have been supporting that here for some time now ; however , you yourself have replied to repeated questions which honourable Members have put to you in the past , saying that this is more or less impossible .
I have two questions to ask .
Have we considered the fact that the candidate countries , which by then will be members , will need to learn to work within the European Parliament and , as in the past , their parliaments will need to send representatives to Parliament in Strasbourg and Brussels until such time as European elections are held ?
Mr President , the 45-year history of the European Parliament confirms the Communist Party of Greece 's assertion that it was created in order to serve the interests of big business , not of the people , as many would have us believe .
Small and medium-sized enterprises in town and country are being wiped out .
Pre-accession relations have given them a bitter foretaste of what happens when companies are restructured , nationalised industries are snapped up by foreign capital , their important social rights are abolished and support is given to their local exploiters , often the Mafia , who are proving to be privileged partners of the European Union .
.
Finally , we need control mechanisms to ensure that these measures are put into practice .
It seems to me that the President-in-Office of the Council endeavoured to give a very general reply with references to a few interesting principles , such as data protection agreements .
I should like to ask if the Spanish Presidency is making practical arrangements and , rather than following the Berlusconi line , which caused a great many problems and violated the fundamental rights of the citizens of the European Union by refusing to allow peace-loving Greek and other nationals to land in Italy , is making arrangements to follow the Porto Alegre approach in an effort to create a framework within which the protestors can express their views and their claims legally and peacefully .
Of course efforts are being made to change the system of subsidies paid in the past under the GATT agreements and , if it is changed , it will be at the expense of the agricultural produce and income of the poorer farmers .
I have no objection to that .
Is that what we are trying to do ?
It is time we stopped being two-faced , faced the facts and dealt with things in the proper manner .
For the rest , however , as he himself has said , the subject of tobacco as dealt with in this specific proposal for a Council regulation is a purely technical matter concerning the 2002 , 2003 and 2004 crops .
Lately , however , motivated perhaps by the expediency of supporting its misguided intervention in Gothenburg , it has omitted to repeat its earlier references and is in danger of putting the debate on this issue on the wrong footing .
We disagree with any proposal which is based on the premise of abandoning tobacco production and tries to gild the pill by allegedly seeking alternative forms of employment and income for producers .
Consequently , any reduction in tobacco growing in the Community will wipe out thousands of small and medium-sized holdings and increase imports and merely serves the predatory interests of the huge tobacco industry and distribution monopolies , at the expense of producers and consumers alike .
This is clearly illustrated , for example , in Amendments Nos 7 and 12 , calling for tobacco growers to be encouraged to switch into other crops , which is why we shall be voting against it .
The Council 's legal services question whether recital 5 is legal .
( EL ) All the proposed amendments in the report are an improvement on the proposal for a Council regulation , which is why we shall vote in favour of them .
As a result , any efforts to improve the nut sector are undermined by a glut of very cheap imports of similar products from the USA and Turkey .
Given that the ? U has no intention of changing this preferential customs regime for the USA and Turkey , we need to really boost these specific measures , not just maintain them .
We shall be voting in favour of the European Parliament report , despite the fact that the measures are so limited .
( EL ) The Commission proposal for a regulation on tobacco is unacceptable .
All it will do is increase sales by American multinationals .
The United States has no hesitation in violating any agreements made in order to defend their interests .
The workers stand to gain nothing from this wrangling .
This is typical of social systems which have long run out of anything to offer society , and capitalism is one such system .
It is interesting that the European Parliament resolution accuses the United States of failing to restructure the steel industry promptly , as the European Union did
