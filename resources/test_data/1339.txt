the Commission to table a proposal with the model chosen for the introduction of biometric data on visas , ...     .
This is a further example of undermining national sovereignty , and we are opposed to the move .
I believe that the EU must act clearly on this issue and must provide a responsible framework of rules for the maritime transport of oil and other noxious liquid substances .
The disaster caused by the sinking of the oil tanker is still fresh in the minds of all Europeans .
I have doubts as to the legality of laying down criminal standards based on Article 80( 2 ) of the Treaty relating to transport and as to whether the basis presented by the Commission and Parliament would be lawful , given that criminal sanctions must meet the objectives of the European policy on the environment and transport .     .
Although the amendments that I endorsed did not secure majority support in this House , I feel that the balance of the text is positive , hence my vote in favour .     . – The myriad models and types of licences that allow a citizen of the Member States to drive a motor vehicle may , in a Community in which freedom of movement is the norm , place worrying constraints on the ability of the Member States’ authorities to exercise control , at the inevitable expense of legal certainty and road safety .
The European Union has a dense network of canals and natural rivers which are not yet being used to their full extent and are worth exploiting in view of the safety and environmental friendliness of this mode of transport .
Intermodal transport systems , which form a basic model for future transport , should therefore take account of the positive role that inland waterway navigation can and must play .     . – This Commission proposal represents a major effort to reduce the excessive demands on our roads , particularly with regard to heavy goods transport in Europe .
The intermodality proposed in Europe’s transport policy and the high levels of environmental protection and quality that we want can only be achieved by revitalising areas of activity that can transform these ambitions into reality .
In particular , the 1978 Convention laid down specific criteria for the recognition of certificates for masters , officers and radio officers issued by the parties .
For it to function effectively , however , an operational organising structure needs to be set up to act as a facilitator of the whole procedure .     . – The issue of fisheries is of great importance for Europe as a whole , but above all it is especially important for Portugal , because , in this respect , the interests of our country are not always adequately safeguarded by Community policies .
I am afraid that the practice will continue and will extend to topics the effective scope of which does not deserve such an investment in terms of human and material resources .
Of the examples mentioned , I must highlight the criticism that , of the thirteen actions set out in the Commission 's Environment and Health Strategy for 2004-2010 , only four are concerned with specific measures and none of them sets any targets , and the fact that there is no mention of the mental and neurological health impact of pollution .
The rapporteur invokes the precautionary principle to deny the need for absolute scientific proof that a particular product is dangerous before it is withdrawn from the market .
Indeed , it cannot be an accident that this regulation is appearing before the results of a feasibility study on the agency have been published .
While pointing out the aims and objectives that we have in common , I do not ignore the specific problems that affect a large part of the Mediterranean’s southern rim .
An example is the eradication of malaria , as recommended by the director of the United Nations Millennium Project , because malaria strikes above all at the poorest countries with devastating effect , causing incalculable economic damage .
Poverty and misery feed injustice and despair , and these feed global insecurity .
Therefore , for the sake of protecting the jobs of thousands or even millions of workers and the industry itself , the safeguard clause must be applied urgently , since it will only have a positive effect if it is used soon .     – Although the textile and clothing industry has lost some ground across the European Union in general in recent years , it is still very important in some countries of the Union and , in fact , the economies of several regions are actually structured around it .
It is now appropriate , therefore , to raise the following questions : first : how are the Commission and the Council taking account of the changes occurring in this area and what means are they using to constantly monitor the situation ; and , secondly , under what conditions is the Commission prepared to implement the specific safeguard mechanisms , bearing in mind that there is at least a fear that the United States may do so very soon ?     – The textile and clothing industry in Europe is facing a serious crisis .
First , it should stringently monitor all imports into the single market , and not hesitate to act through the safeguard clauses .
To that end , we need to develop a policy that takes account of the following aspects , amongst others : logistical infrastructure , geographical proximity to major markets , fast order turnaround , design , quality control , innovation , use of new materials and new technologies , relations with major distribution networks , permanent vocational training , and support for SMEs , which still make up the majority of companies in the sector
