Most of the Member States need to apply additional measures in order to achieve the Kyoto objectives .
I believe that the agreement to launch an international dialogue achieved in Montreal is an important stimulus for the European Union .
I consider that Montreal marked a new phase in international cooperation to combat climate change .
However , we cannot rest on our laurels .
This second European programme on climate change will include an extensive review of the policies of the first stage in the climate sector , which includes the European Union emission rights trading system , action on capturing and storing carbon dioxide , air and other forms of transport and other issues .
I absolutely agree that climate change is one of the most serious , if not the most serious problem , which the world is facing today .
It therefore shows how important the contribution of the European Union was , both with this communication and the various interim discussions at bilateral level which we held with countries such as India , China and other rapidly developing countries , such as Mexico and Brazil , which are countries that emit large quantities of carbon dioxide , and with the climate of confidence which we cultivated throughout this time so as to achieve this success .
As I said earlier , we are seeing various weather phenomena , such as hurricanes , prolonged droughts or floods in other parts of the world which are in keeping with scientists ' predictions relating to climate change .
The European Union really is the global leader on this issue .
I honestly believe that with you , with your help , which we urgently need , we shall be able to help combat this major problem for the world as a whole .     – Mr President , Commissioner , from the previous positions and events relating to the demonstrations in Strasbourg and other areas of Europe , we have all realised that we are debating an issue which is very serious in its dimensions and repercussions .
We should therefore be attentive to its multilateral parameters and , at the same time , more efficient in the objectives we wish to serve , by which I mean economic development , competitiveness and convergence between the areas of Europe .
We must be ready to reap the benefits of these policies .
The new version of this directive on ports , despite misleading claims of transparency , guarantees and so forth , is even worse than the one voted down by the European Parliament on 23 November 2003 .
Allow me to close by briefly adding the following to what other speakers have said : one of the basic issues which is a priority for the European Parliament is the safety of life at sea and environmental safety .
What are you trying to do ?
There is a positive modus operandi .
We do not ultimately want an arbitrary Europe ; we want a Europe of the peoples .     – Mr President , Commissioner , the Commission has retabled the proposal for a directive on the liberalisation of port services , but without taking account of why it was rejected by Parliament in 2003 .
Where are the proposals for modernising the overall functioning of ports ?
The best proposal is to withdraw it .     – Mr President , the own-initiative report by Mr Zīle gives a complete picture of relations between the European Union and the People 's Republic of China and Russia in the field of air transport .
In the case of the People 's Republic of China , I welcome its progress , especially its adaptation to the rules of good cooperation with the European Union , the main features of which are the opening up of air corridors by its government to European companies , in order to serve fully passengers and the movement of freight by increasing flights .
The role which the report attempts to ascribe to ' European' citizenship has purely ideological characteristics , creating the false impression of a non-existent ' European citizen' on a single 'political and cultural territory ' , so that it looks as if there is no going back from an imperialist and reactionary EU.
However , the acquisition of these rights has nothing to do with the misleading ideology of ‘European citizenship’ ; it is the fighting ground of the mass grass-roots movement in each Member State and at European level .     – Madam President , I should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur , Mr Fruteau , on behalf of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , for the maturity and efficiency with which he presented his proposals and for his cooperation with the political groups and all the parliamentary committees .
Do you today have at least to make a show of good cooperation with the European Parliament ?
Already in numerous regions , including my country , Greece , demonstrations have started by sugar beet producers and workers in the sugar industry – including the Greek sugar industry – due to the significant repercussions which a reduction in the order of 36 % will have .
You said , Commissioner , that you aimed to make the European sugar industry viable in the European Union .
We are therefore calling , within the framework of close cooperation and a mild adaptation of the new market , for certain proposals which are expressed as proposals in the Fruteau report .
This is important , because efforts are being made to switch to more environmentally friendly forms of energy .
Already in Greece farmers and workers are demonstrating .
The rapporteur is trying with his proposals to delay the repercussions somewhat .
As regards climate change , I would like to comment that , from a scientific point
