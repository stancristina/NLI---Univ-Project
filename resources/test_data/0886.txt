settled and the Commission will say which countries it regards as ready for enlargement at the October European Council .
Meanwhile , we will update the roadmap and pre-accession strategy for Bulgaria and Romania .
On the contrary , it will only be the beginning .
From 2004 , the EU must be capable of performing all its tasks properly and meeting the expectations of the European citizens , who will then number over 450 million .
Enlargement , however , is imminent and we cannot just twiddle our thumbs until a new Treaty is ratified .
We must think solely of the general interest of the system and optimising its performance .
We must undertake to provide practical support for development in the southern hemisphere in line with the priorities laid down by UN Secretary-General , Kofi Annan , of water , hygiene , health , energy , agriculture and biodiversity .
Prime Minister , you mentioned food safety in your speech .
I would also like to thank the Members of this House and , this being the last part-session before the summer recess , wish you all a good holiday .
I will mention just one point , as the Danish Presidency is here , and that is the importance of the constructive , amicable relationship with Greenland and the importance of the geographical , strategic and also human aspects of our relations with that region .
Lastly , we need unity to show that Europe is equal to the huge challenges before it .
The first is the need to influence public opinion in our countries because , although it is certainly true that the Irish referendum will be crucial and decisive , it is equally true that we must ensure that the enlargement process is explained and understood in our countries , and this is a task which is the responsibility of every Member of the European Parliament .
Here , too , the subject is of particular importance , for if we do not succeed in genuinely reconciling federalism and subsidiarity the misconceptions regarding the European machinery are likely to increase somewhat .
It is equally important to pursue the work on the White Paper .
At the end of this debate , the new form of which I too , for my part , have greatly appreciated , we have three messages for you .
Secondly , Cyprus .
In our opinion , there is only one priority : we must make it clear through our words and actions that trade and the market do not take precedence over every form of environmental undertaking or over environmental agreements .
Indeed , the Conference of Presidents has the tools to conduct an in-depth analysis , in other words to assess matters case by case , and to take a decision .
Mr President , I voted against this proposal for a regulation .
It occurs to me that we are spending too long deciding how good or how bad what we eat is , what it is made of and whether it includes GMOs or not , while so many people in the world are hungry and have nothing to eat .
I am , however , concerned that this may happen in a disorganised manner and especially in such a way as to curtail the activities of small traders , small farmers and those working in cottage industries .
That is why I voted for it .
I would like to take the opportunity of explaining my vote for this decision to stress that I am in favour of nuclear energy both personally and as the representative of the Pensioners ' Party here in Strasbourg .
Mr President , like very many members of the PPE-DE Group , I too voted against this document , not only because its contents do not fully reflect our ideas on abortion and the sexual problems affecting European citizens ' health but also because in this way I mean to stress the fact that , although I agree that we should talk about this important topic , I really wish we could talk just as often about the health of the elderly , the lives of pensioners and also - why not - what happens as regards relations between the sexes among the elderly .
We also point out that : competence in health matters lies with the Member States , as do decisions in the area of ethics ; the report does not deal at all with problems connected with the right to life and the right to a dignified life , nor does it address issues which we have repeatedly put to the Commission , such as a fund to help women in financial or psychological difficulties who would like to terminate a pregnancy .
A starving man is not a free man : he is a desperate man and can easily be persuaded to take part in desperate actions such as conflicts , international crime , drug trafficking , human trafficking , illegal immigration and terrorism .
The way it works and is managed needs to be reformed and rationalised in order to improve its transparency and efficiency and to achieve more suitable actions and results .
What actions were expected of us ?
Mr President , Minister , it is quite true that the failure of the UN and the failure of the plan to tackle hunger is due to a lack of sensitivity even on the part of many governments .
We need to grant mountainous regions prominence and attention and restore their specific identity , but most of all we must not be ashamed to consider them already a potentially poor area .
It may also be our duty to do our utmost to make this tool effective , in the conviction that future administrations of our US friends may possibly take a different attitude and themselves take advantage of the major tool we are offering them .
