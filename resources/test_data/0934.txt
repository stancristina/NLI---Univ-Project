Ek , who drafted the opinion of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , and was equally active in putting forward the objections of industry , albeit without losing sight of the vital importance of protecting health and the environment .
It is evident that various committees are making strenuous efforts to enhance the Agency’s role in assessing risk .
The intended rules for substances intended to be released from products appear to the Commission to be reliable .
Let me also emphasise to the budgetary authority that giving the Agency additional tasks must , self-evidently , be accompanied by a corresponding increase in its financial resources .
We are in favour of pre-registration and prioritisation as standard .
Matters relating to authorisation and scope are still outstanding , and I hope we will manage to come to an agreement on them too .     .
The incidence of breast cancer has doubled in Europe over the last twenty years ; one woman out of every nine in Europe suffers from cancer , and this is in many cases attributable to chemicals .
Fourthly , voluntary cooperation must be encouraged ; there must be no mandatory consortia of the kind that the British Presidency keeps on proposing .
These are figures of which you simply have to take note , for they are important , not only for Germany , but also for the European Union , when it comes to maintaining jobs .
The fact is that this would give cause to fear that requiring data without reference to risk would result in substances being lost to the market solely for reasons of cost .
At the same time , I should also like to thank Mrs Ek and Mr Nassauer for having drafted key opinions on behalf of other committees consulted .
Accusations that this House has been hypnotised by the chemical industry are insulting , and we should voice our protest at them .
I should like to conclude by drawing the House’s attention to a study carried out by the European Trade Union Confederation , which found that 50 % of cases of occupational asthma and skin disorders would be prevented by a hard-hitting version of REACH.
Several of the speakers referred to the fact that the chemical industry in Europe is dominated by small and medium-sized enterprises .
Why is it that the public statements made by yourself and your officials have intimated that a decision has already been taken , and why is there such a rush to grant freedom of movement ?
This would allow countries the prospect of EU membership in order to focus their development efforts , but at the same time avoid any negative impact on the EU’s capacity for development .
In my opinion , we cannot grant any country independence or offer it a closer relationship with the European Union unless it meets European standards .
This is the last thing we can afford in this highly unstable region , parts of which were ravaged by civil war until recently .
There are three priority problems for us to tackle in South-East Europe .
Equal importance should also be attached to the second aspect of this issue , namely providing the public with information about what happens if they book a ticket and an airline subsequently intends to use a blacklisted plane .
I am also delighted that we have succeeded in taking account of the rights of airline employees in the regulation .
That is the purpose of the regulation before us today , whose urgent adoption is backed across the political spectrum .
In the UK, the government , that is to say the taxpayer , has taken on the knock-on financing for the decommissioning fund : EUR 1.5 billion according to the Commission ’s estimates .
The aim of my compromise text , which I am presenting in this Chamber today together with my own-initiative report , and which we will be voting on tomorrow , is to encourage the Commission to take action on deficiencies in relation to provisions for waste disposal .
I will also work to this end in the context of discussions on the financial perspective and in the budget debates for forthcoming periods .
Let me once again appeal to the House to support Slovakia in this instance and give it a real helping hand , so that we can , in the interests of Europe’s safety , close this power station down as soon as possible .     .
Failing that , we will be unable to actively promote peace in Iraq .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , let me start by making the observation that the Council Presidency left us waiting some 10 to 15 minutes for the beginning of this debate .
It is also important , though , that long-term strategies should be in place to enable us to respond , and in order to give us the security to plan ahead .
Windscale is an example of the great experience you have had with the real damage reprocessing does to the environment and to people .
That was decided long ago .
That I regard as false , since I do not regard nuclear energy as a realistic alternative for the future and believe that the risks associated with it are not yet manageable .
I think it is marvellous that you use that to express indirect but justified criticism of the fact that there could be more of us here , but it was our quality that you chose to highlight , and that shows what mastery of parliamentary skills is to be found in the UK.
It has to be said , though , that if you and the President of the European Council are to do that , you will need to have the courage to draw a clear line under the issue of the British rebate .
