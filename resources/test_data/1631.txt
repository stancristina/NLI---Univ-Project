the Belgian Consulate in Vientiane , and with other Member States with local representation or accredited in Bangkok , and the Commission has held an informal meeting with top officials of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Laos .
The assistance is being provided in the form of health care and food support , increasing the availability of drinking water and improving the sanitation system , providing seed and tools , in order to guarantee food security , and distributing basic necessities such as shelters and blankets .
Furthermore , the Commission is preparing , together with the government , a programme for the rehabilitation of the north , a particularly difficult area .
Mr President , setting aside the issue of the choice by the new Spanish caudillos regarding Mr Rajoy - which , by the way , reminds us of General Franco 34 years ago - I will focus on the meaning of the outrageous exclusion of my political party more than one year ago .
This heat wave has furthermore led to a series of disasters , some of which are now recurrent , such as forest fires .
Since we are talking about an endemic affliction it is important to adopt emergency measures : they would serve as antibiotics .
As has already been said , we have had heat for centuries .
Why have appropriations always been left over , Commissioner ?
As well as the loss of human lives , which we have to mourn , as well as the Dante-esque images left behind by the fires and the economic losses they have caused , the magnitude of the disaster which year after year hangs over the forests of the south of Europe and the consequences it has for the European Union as a whole demonstrate the need for a Community policy for protecting the forests against fires , with its own funding , which takes account of the specific nature of Mediterranean forests and which provides for prevention measures as an integral element in the management of forests , as this Parliament had requested at the time .
Community competences in the environmental field as well as the commitment made by the European Union in Kyoto require greater budgetary contributions and greater involvement by the European Union in the fight against fires .
We cannot do many more things with much less money , because 5 million out of EUR 18 million is a very significant percentage .
That notion is the duty of loyalty enshrined in Article 10 of the Treaty establishing the European Community .
This has been suitably taken up by Mr Koukiadis in his report and I would like to thank him for that .
We would suggest that another new Europe-wide phenomenon should be taken into account also .
It is that nobody wants to go there to work .
Or should we be aiming at a balanced Europe ?
President Prodi circulated the research to the rest of the Commission .
Regions set to exceed the crucial threshold of 75 % of Community GDP as a result of the statistical factor need to know what provision the Commission intends to make for them .
.
Nobody wants that to happen .
The report I am presenting states that this should be the case .
The same should apply to territories .
I am confident that the Council , the Commission and the Commissioner will heed the report by this House rather than the report by Mr Sapir .
It is also vital to accident prevention .
This has facilitated progress on some of the issues raised .
It could even be deemed more important than the latter .
It will facilitate more widespread support and simplify earlier provisions .
This treaty accords Greenland a similar status to that enjoyed by 19 other territories , namely Overseas Country and Territory status .
The report should be set in the broader context of the Arctic dimension .
We therefore believe that even in the case of minor adjustments , the principles of good governance , transparency and optimal use of Community financial resources should be applied here and now .
The Committee on Fisheries is also calling for the cost of the agreement to be shared fairly , as is the case for agreements for the southern regions where the cost is divided equitably between the shipowners and the Community budget .
The fishing opportunities relating to the remaining EUR 28 million have a very low take up .
They could also be beneficial to the Community .
At the same time , the fishing opportunities have decreased .
I assume the hope is that this fisheries agreement will cease to violate the principles we hold most dear .
Another option would be to finance them through the European Development Fund .
In this connection , it is worth emphasising that the fisheries agreement with Greenland comes second in order of importance for the Union in terms of what it costs the Community 's budget .
Fishing remains crucial to the economy of Greenland .
Nonetheless , although the committee recognises the need to provide financial support for Greenland , it is opposed to the current approach of including such aid in the financial compensation that is part of the Fisheries Agreement .
I would therefore urge the Commission to present similar mid-term reviews for all agreements exceeding annual costs of EUR 3 million for the European Union 's budget .
If you will allow me to say this , I believe the Commission has backed down , or if I may put it another way , the wise are ready to rectify .
Experimental campaigns have been authorised since July , for new species , and there are possibilities for diversifying fisheries in Greenland , which is positive - I was in Greenland when I was chairman of the committee - and I know that there are other scientific possibilities and they must therefore be exploited
