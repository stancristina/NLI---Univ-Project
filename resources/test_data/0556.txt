The fashionable idea that the Eurocentric world ( or simply a world in which Europe is economically and strategically important ) died with the advent of the global economy is not a cast-iron truth , it is an opinion that may be contradicted by the facts ; and facts are shaped by political will .
It is also unacceptable for these countries to use child labour and forced labour and not to honour workers ' rights .
The 'trans-European networks ' are implemented with Community and Member State funding - in other words , clearly public funding - with the aim of completing the internal market , as explained in point 1 of the Council common position : 'strong and integrated energy and transport networks are the cornerstone of the European internal market and that better use of the existing networks and the completion of missing links will make it possible to increase effectiveness and competitiveness . '
They will enable us to save billions of euros and better to serve the consumers ' interests .
They therefore propose both wholesale and retail price regulation , including the creation of a regulated retail price - Eurotariff - which all operators will be obliged to offer , in order to achieve a significant reduction in the price of roaming .
In view of the cross-border nature of the contractual relations involved in these services , the Member States have shown they are scarcely capable of tackling this issue .
I hope that the operators do not react to the loss of revenue with an unjustified increase in the price of national calls , but instead take the opportunity to raise revenue by increasing the number of customers and by improving the services they provide both nationally and internationally .
In common with other Commission communications on healthcare , this own-initiative report is , to some extent , aimed at once again applying to health services the same approach as the internal market for services , which it does by tabling a fresh proposal for a separate health services directive .
In spite of the controversy generated by this report , which has been sorted out in time , I feel that the report in its current form reaffirms existing rights and fosters patient mobility .
I therefore feel that the outcome is a positive one , and favourable to the citizens ' interests and rights .
I also feel , though , that it needs to be brought up to date .
This is for two reasons .
( Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 163( 1 ) of the Rules of Procedure ) As the report correctly says , 'opening up trade is one of the most effective drivers of economic growth , which is indispensable for reducing poverty and promoting pro-poor economic growth and employment and is also an important catalyst for sustainable development worldwide ' .
In spite of its 'politically correct ' language , the report fails to hide the EU 's true intentions behind the current Economic Partnership Agreements ( EPAs ) , with African , Caribbean and Pacific (ACP ) countries .
In other words , this is merely a sugar-coated version of the neoliberal agenda .
Among other issues , the report advocates the rejected ( ! ! ! ) ' Constitutional Treaty ' .
The true intention of the political forces and the economic and financial interests at the root of European capitalist integration is to speed up the militarisation of the EU , in a legal and constitutional framework - within the NATO framework , remember - and this would be established by the so-called ' European Constitution ' .
The majority in Parliament blocked the adoption of some of the best paragraphs adopted in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the theme of 'Promoting decent work for all - The EU contribution to the implementation of the decent work agenda in the world ' .
Anything that can be done to remove or reduce the bureaucratic intricacies woven by agricultural policy while it has been in force , which in some cases have been the most surreal puzzle for farmers , has to be applauded .
For these reasons , the Socialist Group in the European Parliament gives the benefit of the doubt to the Commission 's proposal , and seeks to contribute by means of amendments on its initiative and by supporting others aimed at improving upon the proposal .
At the heart of the matter is the sovereign power of Member States to nominate MEPs and to define how they are represented in the European Parliament within the context of the existing regulatory framework for elections to Parliament .
There are currently 5 000 animals and 28 000 plants protected by CITES including species found on Portuguese territory .
In order to deal with the under-funding of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development , the report follows the trend of providing for the use of structural funds and seeks 'to promote and strengthen public-private partnerships' , in other words to put public investment at the mercy of private profit .
There is sometimes a discrepancy , however , between that idea and the reality .
As well as the opening up of physical borders arising from the process of EU integration , one must be mindful of the fact that globalisation and its mechanisms also come into play when it comes to crime .
Hence our vote against the resolution .
All anti-fascists and democrats should join forces to express their indignation .
I wish to point out that Portugal was one of the founding Members of NAFO , represented by the Community when it joined in 1986 .
Apart from the delay in activating this EU financial assistance , the cause of which must be investigated , one of the most striking points is the paltry amount in relation to
