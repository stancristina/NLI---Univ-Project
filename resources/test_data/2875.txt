It is very clear that this solution will involve one of the most important aspects of relations in this area at present , which is the extremely positive trend in relations between Athens and Ankara and the very important part played in these relations by the Greek Foreign Minister , Giorgios Papandreou , and the Turkish Foreign Minister , Ismail Cem .
.
But we also need to be aware that it is by virtue of rational political stances , and flexibility in negotiations , that we are able to find solutions to the major disputes which have ultimately led to many tragedies in history .
We do not play at political correctness in this House : we are concerned with fairness at international level and with concrete statements on this issue consistently defined by the Council over a period of time , and which the European Commission has also followed carefully , attentively and pragmatically .
The authorities of the Republic of Cyprus itself have clearly recognised that our relations with them regarding their accession to the European Union have been positive .
I believe that the work done by the previous presidency in defining the financial outlook was excellent , regardless of who was involved in that work .
It emphasised the importance of the Council taking new measures within a Community framework and in the context of its own work with international organisations .
This House will of course also be invited to give its views on these proposals , given that these are matters subject to the codecision procedure .
In view of the seriousness of such situations , we can congratulate ourselves on the fact that the authorities have at least reacted and undertaken to examine the legislative provisions already existing in this field .
The information that I have is to do with the 1995 directive , which does not include any provisions of that kind .
As you know , the European Community has contributed a total of EUR 378 million for the province of Kosovo alone , and this has to be seen in conjunction with the contributions made by Member States at national level .
This is not just a technical situation , it is a political situation , and it goes hand in hand with the need to solve the political situation , because there are aspects to this , and we may as well be open about this , which are associated with the international community ' s inability up to now to make a multi-ethnic society function in Kosovo , with tragic effects on attempts to improve health care in that region .
We have to remember that we share responsibility in that region with the international community .
The situation in Mitrovica is appalling , and involves very special tensions , and I believe that the measures taken over the last few hours to create safe conditions in that area are to be welcomed .
Everyone is free to hold such views .
I am sure you are aware , Mr Alavanos , that , during her recent visit to NATO headquarters , Prosecutor Del Ponte stressed that the International Tribunal was obliged to examine all accusations presented to it , including those made against NATO , in particular by pacifist groups from Canada .
With regard to the judicial structure in Kosovo , we have already heard Mr Kouchner , on various occasions , describe the enormous difficulties he is experiencing in setting up administrative machinery and a judicial structure .
We are certainly very much aware that this factor is seriously compromising Mr Kouchner ' s work and the normalisation of administrative structures in Kosovo , especially as regards judicial structures and police cover .
We are of course entering a grey area here , and you may say , Mr Marset Campos , that these are civilian targets , such as bridges and road and rail infrastructure , whilst others will tell me that they are military targets , because they are targets which support military structures in aggressive campaigns such as those carried out by Mr Milosevic ' s forces in Kosovo .
Another aim is to maintain a bilateral political dialogue with Armenia , in view of its major role in that subregion .
In December 1999 , as we all know , Turkey was accepted as a candidate for membership of the European Union .
We hope that Turkey will adopt a constructive and positive attitude .
Our relationship with Armenia , as evinced by the agreement we signed with that country last year , is of course one element in these foreign relations .
That Council emphasised its support for the efforts of UNMIK and of Bernard Kouchner , the special representative of the Secretary-General , and in particular their efforts to create an interim administrative structure , in Kosovo , under which the guarantee that it will include all sides , particularly those which have until now refused to take part in this interim structure , will not be an empty one .
These minorities are often not mentioned enough when discrimination taking place in Kosovo is discussed .
By this I mean the large number of refugees and displaced persons who have had to be rehoused , the fact that most of the infrastructure has been destroyed , the strength of feeling that still exists in every section of Kosovo ' s population , the fact that the economy has collapsed and the total lack of internal tax income .
Strengthening police forces is also an important task in the context of the growing threat represented by organised crime , and the Commission is seeking to include the fight against organised crime in its programme of assistance for Kosovo for 2000 and is asking the Member States to identify what assistance they can provide
