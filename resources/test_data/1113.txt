proposal and believe that it could benefit the industry , but , most importantly , that it could benefit consumers , too .
It will benefit those people who have been employed in the EU and have been fired for refusing to put their signature to false accounts and becoming whistle blowers .
They can bring cases of this nature before the European Court of Human Rights under Article 6 .
It will benefit fellow Members here in Parliament who receive extortionate fines for expressing their opinions freely and who have nowhere to go to appeal against this .
It is thus easy to see the benefits .
For example , there is no doubt that the Court of Justice , in particular , would use the accession to once again extend the EU 's powers .
We do not want to see a situation where Member States are not able to determine their own policy on aliens or issues concerning their freedoms , the freedom of expression and everything else covered by the convention .
Madam President , I would like to thank the various rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation .
We have managed to agree on a report containing recommendations for improving cooperation between universities and business - a report that , above all , contains very specific initiatives for modernising universities .
It is therefore not surprising that education , research and innovation have been given high priority in both the Commission 's work programme and the Europe 2020 strategy .
Of course , I hope that the majority will be in favour of following this upgrading of the priority status of this policy with an increase in funding , too .
We are currently in a situation where we need to think outside the conventional framework of our education systems and we can start by breaking down the walls between universities and the area that benefits from the universities ' output , namely business .
Firstly , I would like to mention the modernisation of the curriculum .
University courses must reflect , to a greater extent , the requirements of the labour market and they must be set up with that in mind , for example , in the form of more business-relevant curricula , which , in turn , the business community should actively help to keep up-to-date .
It is important to reduce the gap between universities and business and for there to be people who bridge this gap .
At the same time , these students are better prepared to enter the labour market after their courses .
Research can also build bridges between universities and business .
In fact , I held an evening of debate in Brussels on 3 February 2010 in Parliament with broad participation from both the business world and universities , and the view that evening was pretty clear : an EU business PhD scheme would be a most useful tool for promoting specialised business-relevant research , as well as competitiveness , in European business , thereby creating more jobs and economic growth .
It thus received absolutely unequivocal support from both parties .
Moreover , it is a most effective method of bringing business experience and practical knowledge into universities and thereby making the teaching more focused on skills and knowledge that are relevant to the demands of the labour market .
I am pleased that , tomorrow , we will be able to adopt a report that contains a recommendation to establish just such a scheme .
She is right in saying that the multiannual financial framework for the EU 's budget is now so tight that a lot of promises will be very difficult to fulfil .
We need to be able to follow up on the 2020 growth strategy and to invest in joint energy projects and in joint transport projects , we need to be able to invest in young people and in research and we need to be able to finance a strong and joint External Action Service .
We desperately need the promised mid-term review of the budget so that we can be clear about how we can finance new needs .
They just do not want to pay via the EU budget .
They are to be paid for both by the Member States directly and out of the EU budget .
If the whole of the expenditure were to be taken from the EU budget , the multiannual financial framework would burst !
However , it is , of course , a lot more bureaucratic and cumbersome to collect money directly from the Member States and it gives us a poorer overview , less control and a poorer ability to monitor the situation .
So , should we not make savings in the EU budget ?
There is no possibility of creating problems .
Madam President , I am a strong supporter of the transport of freight by rail .
Many EU Member States have for years failed to maintain their rail network , which has favoured the transport of freight by road .
It is high time that we gave the operation of trains a higher political priority .
But - for there is a 'but ' - the railway is not a magic or problem-free solution .
It has its Achilles heel .
Freight has to be taken from the place of production to the railway by lorry , after which it is transported by train to a station near to the end user .
This automatically makes the product more expensive , prolongs the transport time and increases the administrative burden .
We need to look at the national situation in the individual Member States and see how it can be improved and coordinated .
Our Member States and our rail systems are very different and we need to respect that and use it as the starting point from which to work
