We have always argued for financial perspectives that safeguard the principle of economic and social cohesion in an enlarged EU and we must not forget that today’s budget is the lowest since 1987 , in relative terms , in other words , less than 1 % of Community GNI , which makes a revision of the financial perspectives necessary .
Contributing to the privatisation of economies , to support for small and medium-sized businesses that create employment , which help to stabilise immigration in the countries of origin , and contributing to eliminating illiteracy , accepting education as one of the most important factors for development , and increasing cooperation in the field of justice , the fight against drugs , organised crime and terrorism , constitute key priorities that add to the dialogue between cultures and civilizations .
Our concern at the current crisis in Chechnya , with the steady stream of reports of serious human rights breaches , obliges us to keep this as a special item on the European agenda and to ask the Russian authorities to reopen negotiations with all the parties involved , in order to reach a political solution to the conflict .
Consequently , I voted in favour of the report .     .
I therefore voted in favour .     . I support the report drawn up by my fellow countryman and friend Luís Queiró , because I agree with the need to adopt measures that will enable us to establish favourable conditions for developing a competitive and viable European defence equipment industry .
It is also a way of respecting the Member States that do not shy away from giving pride of place and importance to transatlantic relations and that wish to cherish the Atlantic Alliance rather than destroy it .
The process of stabilisation and association that has been proposed could constitute an ambitious accession strategy , and it therefore won my vote .     Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to start by recalling that only recently , six months ago to be precise , we gathered here , in this Chamber , to address the situation of human rights in Vietnam .
Given this situation , I wish to reiterate what has been said here and urge the Commission to make our voice , the voice of the European Union , heard loud and clear in Vietnam in order to ensure that religious freedom and the principles of universal human rights are respected .     Presidents , ladies and gentlemen , like Mr Cohn-Bendit , I also take the view that there is no hurry , because the Nice declaration , which started the entire process , scheduled the Intergovernmental Conference for 2004 and I believe that a good and long-lasting agreement which takes a long time to reach is better than a bad agreement reached quickly .
I welcome the rejection of the so-called ‘simplified ’ methods of revising the Treaties , which would constitute an abuse of the traditional model of international and constitutional law .
A solution must also be found to the issue of recognising the heritage of Christianity , of the Judaeo-Christian religion , together with other components of Europe’s historical and spiritual inheritance , and the secular nature of the institutions must be confirmed .
These call for the implementation of the voting system set out in Nice precisely the opposite of the one approved by the Commission , which involves a double majority of States and citizens .
Indicative of this trend is the compromise reached between France , Germany and the United Kingdom , under the auspices of the USA , on the militarisation of the European Union , cementing its institutional bases as a more or less autonomous pillar of NATO .
We have already said here on more than one occasion that this Stability Pact is useless .
Does anyone believe , however , that the Commission will do anything to France and Germany if the governments of those countries do not agree ?
As we now see , however , it did so in order to enforce compliance on others .
We know that the Governing Council of the European Central Bank also supported adopting the Commission ’s proposals .
His words might be harsh , but they are right : ‘the Stability Pact was a stab in the back for the Franco-German axis , which changed from being a boost for a Community-based Europe to a factor for instability .
There is one thing I am sure of , however : we need mechanisms to discipline public finances in the interest of the euro and of Europe .
This is a worrying scenario for highly indebted families and individuals .
This is a powerful and stirring message , in which he recounts the difficulties facing democrats in Cuba , but also talks about the ongoing determination of the Varela Project ( I would draw the attention of all my fellow Members to this fact ) and condemns the fact that he was prevented from coming here .
The time has definitely come for a balance sheet , for an evaluation and for accountability .
Another contributing factor was the lack of auditors , whose skills must always be at the heart of combating financial fraud or irregularities .
We support the Miguélez Ramos report , and have nothing but praise for the rapporteur’s work and for the initiatives she has produced , which are doubtless behind the corrections that are being made to the proposal .
I genuinely believe that we need a global strategy so that we do not only respond to these situations as and when they arise .     Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in order to overcome the problem of its scant fish stocks , the European Union has , amongst other
