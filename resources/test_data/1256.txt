The measures agreed in November 1998 are binding since 21 June , I repeat 21 June 1999 , months before the communication was forwarded to the Parliament ' s Fisheries Committee and 9 months almost to the date .
Now I believe , Commissioner , this is not good enough and that in the future we must learn and that reports must be submitted to the Parliament ' s Fisheries Committee before decisions are taken , otherwise then we are nothing further than a rubber stamp and I know that is not the intention of the Commission or the Commissioner but let us learn from mistakes of the past .
I do not suppose that anybody in this House would object to the principle of protecting juveniles of marine organisms .
Indeed , it is often stated that one of the general objectives of the common fisheries policy shall be to protect and conserve living marine aquatic resources .
All laudable stuff .
There can also be no doubt that bluefin tuna is of enormous environmental and financial significance .
As a king sport fisherman myself , I would love to see the days of the 1930s come back when anglers from the port of Scarborough in Yorkshire caught bluefin tuna weighing up to 830 pounds .
I do not know what the metric equivalent is .
So I support the findings of ICCAT and I support the principle of intergovernmental cooperation on environmental issues .
My concern though with this debate is that we are fiddling whilst Rome burns .
The common fisheries policy is not working .
For all of the high-minded talk about conservation , the reality is that the quota system is directly leading to an environmental disaster .
In mixed fisheries , you cannot discriminate .
The sheer volume of fish that are thrown back dead also means that any improvement in fisheries data is meaningless .
From a UK perspective there is also a deep-seated political objection to the CFP.
Many people now feel if this is federalism you can keep it .
Let me illustrate this with a topical example .
In February , Commission Regulation 394/2000 designed to protect Irish Sea cod stocks was issued .
It means that in Fleetwood , 30 inshore boats are tied up until the end of April .
The scientists and the fishermen both agree that something has to be done .
However , more than a dozen large Belgian beam trawlers have been granted a derogation from this regulation so the vessels that caused the very problem in the first place are carrying on fishing whilst it is a criminal offence for the UK fleet to do so .
The CFP does not assist in conservation and is angering the British public to the point where we demand to re-establish control over our own territorial waters .
Can I first of all congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report .
Conservation is something that I hear on many occasions and a lot of people pay lip service to it .
A lot of people are all in favour of it until it arrives on their own doorstep.
It is all very well to talk about conservation and I agree with it totally .
But at the end of the day one has got to strike the balance between those who are dependent on their life and their livelihood from the sea and those who are making the laws which govern who may or may not fish and where , when and how they may fish in any particular waters within the European Union .
Commissioner Fischler , of course , knows me from a long time back and I have written to him on BSE and many other issues in agriculture but now that he is responsible for fisheries I am going to have to berate him on fisheries , along with his lusty colleagues , because one of the areas that has been most affected has been my region and the fishermen of Northern Ireland .
In actual fact they have had a moratorium imposed upon them without any recompense , without any real negotiation or discussion .
It has been imposed upon them that they cannot fish for about an 11 to 12 week period .
Now we all accept that there is a problem in conservation and a problem of stocks , but what I am really saying to you Commissioner , and I have said this to you in the Fisheries Committee and I will say it to you again : There is a wide divide between Brussels and the working fishermen .
It does not matter whether you come from Galicia , it does not matter whether you are from Northern Ireland or whether you are from Scotland .
That chasm exists and we in Brussels have not been able to cross that divide .
And we have got to take on board the views of the fishermen .
We have got to take on board the concerns of the fishermen and we have got to work closely with them and I hope that you , as the Commissioner responsible for fisheries , will recognise that divide and will try and work as closely as you possibly can to ensure that all sides are brought together and their views are taken on board .
I wish to put two questions to the Commissioner .
Parliament has passed a resolution calling for the polluter pays principle to be applied in this instance and for both the shipowners and the owners of the cargo to be liable .
The question for the Commissioner is really whether these principles can actually be applied and whether we will get any money by way of compensation from these people .
The second point relates to the future and the publication of the Commission ' s White Paper on environmental liability which is designed to ensure
