direction .
Such a development would benefit both parties in the short and long term alike .
We Swedish Social Democrats voted in favour of the report .
The report states clearly that this should be done together with the social partners where applicable .
However , the Swedish Conservatives have chosen to vote against the report because several of the proposals cross the boundaries of the principle of subsidiarity .
There are many praiseworthy statements about anti-discrimination and the importance of equal treatment in this report which deserve attention .
This must not become yet another example of where the EU goes in and regulates in detail in an area which must lie entirely and completely at the Member State level .
Approval of Minutes of previous sitting : see Minutes 1 .
Christian communities in the Middle East ( debate ) Mr President , whenever we discuss the EU 's agricultural policy in this Chamber , rational citizens are reminded how unreasonable it still is , in spite of certain improvements in recent years .
That is why the rapporteur is able to say the following with a straight face : 'It is vital for Community cotton production to remain prosperous , ensuring satisfactory production levels that allow for the continued viability of the ginning industry , which accounts for 3 200 jobs in Greece and 920 in Spain . '
The rapporteur also has no hesitation in using phrases like 'safeguarding a prosperous sector of Community agriculture such as cotton production is crucial . '
Such adaptation may be difficult and require State aid , but the support should be used for change , not to protect production which is clearly better carried out in other countries outside of the EU.
We therefore regret that the Commission has not had the opportunity to present a proposal in this area which is in line with the policy for other agricultural sectors in which support has been de-coupled from production .
However , this must take place through the UN and its various bodies which , unlike the EU , have legitimacy and broad support among a majority of states .
We are opposed to the passages in the report which seek to turn the EU 's election observation missions into policy toward third countries .
We have therefore chosen to support the report .
On the other hand , the June List sees free-trade agreements between the EU and other regions as a natural consequence of having a single market and a common commercial policy .
We support increased transparency in political decision-making .
It is not possible to provide a detailed account of how opinions and views are formed .
Transparency must be based on politicians taking responsibility for their positions and accounting for their motives .
Furthermore , a common register of lobbyists shared by the European Parliament and the Commission would be to give up Parliament 's independence .
It goes without saying that one person cannot be an expert in everything .
Registering interests is , of course , not entirely simple , not least when it comes to defining who or what groups are carrying out lobbying activities .
I voted in favour of the lobby report in its final version because it is , in spite of everything , a microscopic step forward relative to the present situation .
Instead , sport should govern itself as far as possible in order to retain its independence and autonomy .
The Lisbon Treaty is also 96 % identical to the Constitutional Treaty which has already been rejected in referendums in France and the Netherlands .
I voted against the report because I think it is too closely related to the Lisbon Treaty .
No one can reasonably be opposed to EU Member States taking strong action against doping and xenophobia within sport .
Personally , I believe that liberalisation , under controlled forms and with licensed gambling and lottery companies , would be able to satisfy both the interest of consumers in a range of gambling options and the sports movement 's need for resources .
In the great majority of cases , however , the problem has not been the legislation in itself but the implementation of the legislation by the national authorities .
As regards Amendment 14 , we think that it is factually incorrect to say that the Treaty does not permit military intentions .
Junilistan sympathises wholeheartedly with those parts of the Resolution which deal with the treatment of American prisoners and their transportation through European countries .
The United States must either bring the captives before a court or release them , in accordance with international law .
We do not think that the European Parliament has a role to play as regards the political situation in countries which are not in the immediate vicinity of the EU , such as Iran , Kosovo or Iraq .
The EU should not concern itself with everything .
But at the same time the text also covers matters which are quite definitely of national significance and should be decided at national level .
The affirmation in paragraph 35 that rural development measures should be aimed directly at farmers strengthens Junilistan 's impression that the old , overburdened 'common agricultural policy ' has now merely changed its name to 'rural development ' in the EU budget .
The fisheries policy pursued by the EU is not , and has never been , based on well thought-out , joint decisions .
The explanatory statement claims , among other things , that the recovery of cod is a matter of utmost importance and that the best method would be to completely prohibit cod fishing , even if this measure is subsequently rejected .
It is reasonable to suggest that the focus should instead be on safeguarding recovery to a greater extent than is happening at present .
I therefore voted against the report
