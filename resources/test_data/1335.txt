Finally , with regard to the transatlantic Summit at the end of this month , it is very important to demonstrate the will of both sides to once again take up our responsibilities within a multilateral context , particularly at a time when there are signs of hope in the Middle East peace process and an opportunity to work for the future of the United Nations .

The President tells me that this issue does not fall within the competence of the Council , but Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty indicate that it falls within the competence of the Council and of Parliament .
