maybe even some suggestions for finally changing the EPC.
Should Parliament have codecision ?     Mr President , we need a Constitution in order to respond to the challenges which the new millennium has brought for cooperation .
They have called for transparency in decision making , clarity in agreements and treaties , and power in matters which need to be dealt with together so that the measures taken are sufficiently effective .
As the next country to hold the presidency , Finland deserves our appreciation for implementing this principle .     Mr President , I would like to make three points .
We need to take a look at what we have achieved over the past 10 to 12 years and the results are overwhelming – everything from enlargement to justice and home affairs , CFSP , and , of course , the single currency .
Sometimes we have a tendency to lose perspective .
We go from one little crisis to another , but I think the bigger picture is a success story .
Five minutes after that , they get into the blame game , go in front of their national media and say , ‘oh no , what an awful decision the EU has just made’ .
The final point I want to make is that we need a constitutional treaty .
So we need to fix it , and hopefully we can fix it before 2009 .
Deepening and widening go hand in hand .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we have to understand that sustainable development is the basis of our future .
Our experience is quite the opposite .
The problem is that when an analysis is carried out , the results are not believed .
We need ambitious targets , when , for example , it comes to saving energy .
The least we could do , and the cheapest option , is that we should decide to end aid that is harmful to the environment .
Mr President , on behalf of the Social Democrats I can say that I agree with the Commissioner that we must at long last move from words to deeds in the matter of policy on sustainable development .
Policy instruments , for their part , need to adapt to these goals .
The Council decided years ago now that aid that harms the environment should be gradually withdrawn .
We know that their introduction will require consensus , but we need a step forward in the right direction .
The Council has also taken decisions that Europe-wide energy taxes should be introduced .
A condition of a genuine environmental policy is that the economic policy instruments in legislation and other legislative acts go hand in hand .
It is absolutely stuff !
To me this resolution is about four things .
Second , it is clear that racist violence has increased in Europe and we cannot just sit down and watch it .
We need action .
My third and final point is that when I came here I thought that the resolution should not name any countries or political parties .
Can you give us any information about what those ambiguities are ?
When are we expecting a response from the Iranians ?     President-in-Office , I am in the process of trying to get a visa for Russia .
We cannot find any of those .
Nevertheless , my question – which is slightly dangerous , as I come from Finland , which has a border of 1 300 km with Russia – is : what is your educated guess about the timetable for a visa-free zone ?     Mr President , we can all be very satisfied with the resolution before us .
The directive itself is nothing short of revolutionary in the way it opens up investment markets in the EU and achieves better guarantees for investor protection than in previous legislation .
This is the first time the European Parliament has been fully involved in concluding implementing legislation at the comitology phase .
All the parties involved can feel justified pride in the way we managed to overcome potential interinstitutional pitfalls since , as we all know , Parliament’s role in comitology is the topic of an often heated debate .
I agree with the remarks made by the Commission on Monday to the effect that we have achieved something historic not only for the financial markets but also in the manner Level 2 legislation and other comitology legislation is framed .
Despite the positive outcome , I should like to mention a few points .
I hope that the Commission and national regulations will interpret the resulting provision in the light of the agreement reached in the Level 1 Directive .
Finally , I had hoped that a more modern interpretation of the business in derivatives could have been found .
I should like to thank all the participants and all my colleagues who helped in this endeavour .     Mr President , even though you made some jokey remarks about this MIFID arriving in the European Parliament , I should like to say that it is not just a technical issue that we are adopting today .
It was a disgrace for Parliament that the issue was debated as the last item on yesterday’s agenda .
Getting those powers was a historic moment for the European Parliament .
I know that every political group backs these extra powers for the European Parliament .
Unfortunately , the PPE-DE Group did not sign the joint resolution as a group .
Even though the joint resolution had some ambiguities and was not 100 % perfect , I can support it , based on the fact that it was reasonably balanced for this House .     .
The recent unrest , violence and the huge numbers of refugees in East Timor have therefore been a disappointment for the international community
