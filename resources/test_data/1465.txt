European policy for tourism or , more accurately , for the modes of tourism that coexist within the confines of the European Union .
Obviously , the relative decline that has occurred is a consequence of the emergence of new destinations on other continents , although European tourism has continued to grow in absolute terms with the anticipated creation of 1.85 million new jobs by the year 2007 .
On the contrary , they will certainly benefit from it , although , as is emphasized in the report , they will be requested to refrain from taking advantage of its introduction to round prices up and introduce unjustified increases in the costs of the products and services they supply .
On Amendment No 11 Madam President , this is not a linguistic problem .
It even goes so far as to acknowledge that specific national features may continue to exist , provided that , as stipulated in the Treaty , each Member States must ensures that , at the latest , by the date of the establishment of the ESCB , its national legislation including the statutes of its national central bank is compatible with this Treaty and the statute of the ESCB.
Inevitably , the draft resolution is less specific .
Since the free movement of capital is one element in making maximum use of resources , the growth of trade has not been hampered by the free movement of products and services , as might have been feared and would be undesirable .
As we have repeatedly emphasized , this is a requirement which simultaneously renders service to workers and to citizens of the most backward countries , by ensuring that they are not exploited and that their quality of life does not deteriorate .
I would like to know how the Commission intends to act in situations that have unfortunately reoccurred , given that in the future the REGIS initiative will cease to exist , particularly since while the Commission increased its technical justifications , the United States army , for instance , offered cooperation in carrying out the technical restoration of the Ribeiro Quente area .
And as the Commissioner is also aware , there has been a disagreement , a conflict , between Portugal and Spain in connection with the Spanish hydrological plan .
This was conducted virtually up to the time of signing with practically no publicity or democratic debate that would be desirable and indeed necessary in the light of its importance , not only regarding public opinion in EU Member States but also regarding third countries outside the OECD.
The intensity of the euphoria surrounding international agreements may have the adverse result of cancelling their desired positive effects .
In contrast , under MAI , which is approaching its culmination in May , the audiovisual exception must be expressly guaranteed .
I also support the points made on the defence of the rights of patients , including compensation in cases of inappropriate treatment , the implementation of high safety standards in the veterinary and phytosanitary spheres and , finally , the reorganization and clarification of responsibilities in this area which is subject to problems at Commission level .
Curiously , it forgets that halting tobacco production in the European Union would simply give rise to higher imports and hence additional profits for the large tobacco-producing multinationals , which retain their empires intact and which are not even mentioned in the report .
I am taking the floor to make merely obvious points .
ECU 35 million is neither here not there ; it is not worthwhile .
Therefore , a method must be found to connect it to national civic services , merging it with the " Youth for Europe ' programme and linking it with new programmes such as that to create a European apprenticeship status which is currently being debated by Parliament .
Over and above the free movement of people and the human and cultural exchange that may be offered by the programme , one of its central elements lies in working together with young people from other European countries in the voluntary pursuit of a shared civic objective .
Member States must assume responsibility , and encourage other countries to do likewise , for applying existing measures and other measures identified as being necessary to complement them , such as those that are expected to emerge with the imminent introduction of the euro , which , as one OECD body recently stated , " will open the door to the laundering of dirty money ' , because tax havens and other forms of easy money benefitting organized crime can only be eliminated by adopting effective and bold measures .
In 1983 , in view of the gravity of the situation , the Commission submitted a first multiannual guidance programme ( MGP ) which was intended to reduce the fishing effort and which established basic parameters for the tonnage and power of vessels .
Portugal and Spain even exceeded the objectives set .
The Commission should , as a matter of urgency , submit proposals to facilitate setting criteria for such calculations .
In the light of this situation , and of the fact that a balanced conversion of national fleets is essential in guaranteeing the conservation of resources , and in ensuring that Community fishing remains profitable and competitive in future , it is essential that the Council and , by extension , Member States , should recognize their responsibilities and accordingly draw up enforcement measures with real teeth , in the event that the objectives laid down in the multiannual programmes are not met .
For instance , the report demonstrates that my country went furthest in applying MGP III as regards the key issue of reducing the capacity of the fleet 's different components and segments , and that it went even further than the levels set .
