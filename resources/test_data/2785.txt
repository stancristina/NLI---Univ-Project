be able to guarantee that everything has been managed correctly .
She also refused to sign off the accounts for 2001 .
It would be interesting to hear the opinion of the Court of Auditors on this matter too .
Why is the Commission in practice gagging Mrs Andreasen when members of the European Parliament have invited her in to make our audit work easier ?
All of us here are talking about EU unification .
The EU has been incredibly successful in bringing people and states closer together in the European Union .
The European Parliament has clearly stated that it would like to see the Turkish occupying forces withdrawn from northern Cyprus .
I would really like to dwell on this subject and wonder whether we can imagine a country negotiating with the European Union while at the same time unquestionably occupying 37 % of another Member State .
Let us not be blinded by the charm offensive on the part of Turkey .
We have to remember that , without fish , there would be no fishermen , there would be no economy and there would be no fisheries policy .
In its decision , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy also addressed the fact that we rich Europeans buy - for considerable sums it is true , but still for small change - fishing rights from poorer countries .
What are we really doing there ?
Do we have the right to behave as colonially as we are actually doing when it comes to fishing agreements with developing countries ?
Are we listening to their advice and suggestions ?
Sweden has decided , however , that a unilateral fishing ban on cod will apply , for we are living by the precautionary principle .
Simplification is more important than streamlining .
It must be family-friendly .
We regret that the Commission has not included this in its communication .
It is about giving the European Parliament not only the right to be present but also time .
Just like Mr Karas and Mr Bullman , I am quite disappointed that the Commission once again has managed to forget the decisions made at the Gothenburg Summit in which the environment was also to form an aspect of the Lisbon process .
We must also make sure that the environmentally harmful subsidies are abolished .
This is included in the concept of 'sustainable development ' , but the Commission does not really seem to have accepted this or thought it through yet .
Above all , it must be ensured that the environmental indicators are taken seriously , which will in fact not be discussed until a few days before the Council is to reach a decision on this .
What is being discussed is coordination of the economic guidelines and employment guidelines .
Otherwise , we will see an imbalance , changing the character of employment policy , for it will then no longer be determined by the link to the social perspective but will easily become a structural policy which means that employment policy will become a kind of reflection or mirror image - or an appendage .
I think this is so serious that I would like to formulate a kind of warning .
Furthermore , I would like to add something which has to do with synchronisation and coordination .
The biggest problem of all which we face , and which even the Commissioner , for example , knows that I always return to , is that it makes no difference how much we coordinate at European level if we do not achieve better co-ordination between European level and national level and as long as the national labour markets are not sufficiently open .
Others are exploited in hazardous occupations and are miserably remunerated outside any form of social protection system .
I believe that many of them may have reasons for remaining within the EU if they so wish , but that must happen through the customary channels .
She herself mentioned a number of proposals .
Mr President , there is probably no one here in the Chamber , or outside it , who would say that he does not want to combat this type of criminal activity .
I do not like texts that confuse crimes against the individual with crimes against the state .
Directives do not help , therefore .
Mr President , I too want to thank you for the efforts that you personally have made to enable Oswaldo José Payá Sardiñas to leave Cuba after a thousand and one difficulties and no end of bureaucratic obstacles .
I thought you might want to be aware of this before the discussion and prize-giving ceremony tomorrow .
It is a fact that unified scientific opinion , the WHO and the FAO say that irradiation in itself is not at all hazardous .
That is something there are good reasons for doing , because other methods of sterilising spices are still less appropriate from health and environmental points of view .
Naturally , we can say that this treatment is all right , if it is only apparent from the labelling , but I think that the risks of this technology 's being abused are too great .
Instead , quite a few Member States should be exercising tighter control over the irradiation of food that ought not to be irradiated .
It is also a fact that , if it is irradiated so that it will keep longer , food is in danger of losing some of its nutritional value and so becoming less good for consumers .
We recommend the latter alternative .
What is at issue here is Mr Tony Bunyan 's complaint to the Ombudsman , the outcome of which is a success for Parliament , the Ombudsman and Mr Bunyan .
