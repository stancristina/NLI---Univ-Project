In Armenia as in Azerbaijan , democracy is not yet solidly entrenched .
The peace talks are making no headway , as we saw at the most recent OSCE summit .
We must do our utmost , in the interests of the people of Transcaucasia but also in our own European interests , to seek stability in this region .
We cannot endorse this kind of strategy , which may be well-meaning but totally overlooks the real facts .
Of course the natural boundaries are fluid in this area too .
This meat does not even come from Swiss cows !
But there simply was not enough time to do that by tomorrow .
I ca n't help wondering - are n't we talking at such length about flexibility to prevent another area of the debate from going by the board , the area that relates to the democratization of the institutional structure ?
Another cause , as I see it , is that sources of conflict , are imported as a result of excessive immigration , where what happens is that disputes which normally take place in the immigrants ' home countries are transplanted into the countries to which they have migrated , and of course these migratory movements are also exploited by organized crime .
A policy against racism means an end to campaigns against refugees , against immigrants !
But you are right about one thing : racism and xenophobia do not flourish only on the right-hand margin of society .
In this introduction to this motion for a resolution , the European Parliament refers to another resolution of 9 May 1996 , and expressly mentions the recommendations put forward there .
Are there in fact first-class and secondclass citizens ?
So my country and my fellow citizens are making a very great contribution to that integration which has been the specific subject of this debate .
Sometimes it 's just a polite formula , but in congratulating Mrs Reding today I mean every word I say .
Our group hopes that this report will enable us to reject that legitimacy unambiguously and to make a contribution to an expert , efficient joint campaign against the cancer of terrorism !
Another , the biggest of all , is the social disaster of unemployment .
That was a step in the right direction , a step towards solving the problems of transport and achieving sustainable mobility combined with due respect for the environment .
The Green Paper does not invent any additional costs which make transport more expensive .
The taxpayers have to make good the shortfall , and not every taxpayer drives a motor vehicle .
Those new avenues may help to solve the increasingly difficult problems of transport , and I hope that together , despite all our differences of opinion , we shall be able to bring in and continue developing this new transport policy .
Let me mention just three .
( Parliament voted to refer the report back to Committee )
It is essential that we should make a start now on making our knowledge regarding the production of statistics available to the States of central and eastern Europe .
What is happening with the subjects covered by the third pillar ?
The European Union is the level , the organizational form , within which we can cooperate most efficiently and come to grips with the problems most effectively .
This is an abandonment of the ideal of a European institution which is also required to monitor sovereign institutions .
To that extent , I agree with the remarks made by a previous speaker , Mr Schulz .
The fact of the matter is that this Parliament has never been properly consulted at all .
Secondly , we should then turn to the question of substantive law and look for common ground , and the only way will be for there to be give and take on all sides .
The French call it la pr√©somption d'innocence , to use a European term for once , so it is ...
Why are energy efficiency and environmental questions regulated in a protocol , leaving aside Article 19 of the Treaty , which is not binding ?
Firstly , for reasons of content and then , of course , also for formal reasons .
German unity , which was only possible with the assent of the Member States of what was then the European Community , has given us Germans the chance to see what belongs together come together again , as a former Member of this House , Willy Brandt , put it in 1989 .
It is vital for local employment and development agencies to play a larger role with a view to reducing the current rise in mass unemployment .
These are the industrial regions that have to overcome problems for which they need our support because they are engaged in structural adjustment measures ; they were the motive force in Europe for many decades and they therefore deserve our support .
This report is a mid-term evaluation of the development problems and structural fund measures .
Delors also made it clear that basically regional development must be interpreted more broadly .
The lion 's share of ECU 1 130 million goes to NorthRhine Westphalia and Berlin .
And here , Commissioner , we are fully and entirely in agreement with our Italian colleagues .
We know that in the medium term too there will of course be a need for action here after 1999 .
Europe must become a place of greater social justice where social solidarity is ensured ; it cannot continue to be a black hole , swallowing up existing social security systems .
We are making a proposal along these lines .
But they should not be viewed simply in terms of reducing or axing parts of the social security net .
The future of social protection is a matter of great importance for
