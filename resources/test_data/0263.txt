conditions such as the 'commitment to non-violence ' , when it is Israel that is occupying Palestinian territories militarily ; or the 'recognition of Israel ' , when it is Israel that does not recognise the right of the Palestinian people to its sovereign and independent state ; and 'respect for previous agreements and obligations , including the Road Map' , when it is Israel that does not comply with the United Nations resolutions , the Oslo Accords and the Road Map itself and is continuing with its construction of the illegal wall and the policy of settlements .
It would also have the incidental and subsidiary virtue of being a solution that , being perhaps of interest to Morocco , Israel or Tunisia , might also be of possible interest to Turkey if that country were to come to the conclusion that the accession process had reached a dead end .
What , basically , is being put in danger are the nations ' own development models based on specific national needs and circumstances , together with a project of cooperation between these different countries that is genuinely based on mutual support .
I therefore voted in favour , but I would like our debate on these issues to move towards a broader view of the form our relations with our southern neighbours should take .
Furthermore , respect for the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be extended to the entire legislative process and to comitology .
I voted in favour of the report by Mr Meyer Pleite on the negotiation of an EU-Central America Association Agreement because I believe that the European Union must continue to play a fundamental role in protecting the environment and human rights worldwide .
Beyond the intrinsic merits of the proposals we are voting on , regardless of any particular view of the Cyprus issue , this resolution is important because it reminds us that in our ' Europe ' there is still a wall as shameful as the one we have called the 'wall of shame ' , even though in Nicosia the wall has been replaced with boarding .
It is a policy that sidesteps and fails to tackle the underlying causes of immigration , which have been identified for a long time , particularly by the United Nations .
Specifically , we must ascertain precisely what their characteristics and needs are .
There is already plenty of striking information about this issue .
We shall go directly to the places where this hunting is taking place .
We need both .
I trust you will make your contribution and help all EU governments to find a solution as regards both processes and the institutions , because if we want results , we need these institutions .

Turning to the subject of solidarity , I would like to say - in particular to certain Members of your House belonging to political groups with a rather more sceptical view of integration - that it must not be forgotten that solidarity is a two-way street and that you should not forget that the day will probably come when your own country will be in need of solidarity from others , expressed in practical terms .

The rejected proposals were as follows : the increase in national cofinancing of cohesion policy ; the establishment of a maximum period for receiving Structural Funds , regardless of eligibility criteria ; making the award of funds conditional on compliance with certain criteria of economic and/or budgetary policy , such as the Stability and Growth Pact .
For this reason , I share many of the concerns raised by the rapporteur , even if I do not agree entirely with all of the proposed solutions .
I voted in favour of the report because , first of all , it draws attention to the budgetary difficulties that the Member States are expected to experience , given the demographic changes predicted to take place in the EU.
The presentation of the Commission 's strategic policy for 2008 is the start of the process of negotiating the Community budget .
We voted in favour of this report , as it contains many positive aspects , of which I wish to highlight the following : urges the Commission to allocate resources to prevention measures within the framework of the Public Health Action Programme to combat HIV/AIDS and to require that the beneficiaries of public funds devote a certain amount of their research to such diseases ; highlights the fact that palliative care has an important part to play in the care of people with HIV/AIDS and urges its development and expansion throughout the European Union ; asks the Commission to pay particular attention to the promotion of sexual and reproductive health programmes for women , in order to counter the increasing spread of the epidemic among the female population ; encourages the Commission and the Member States to subsidise and provide money for research and development of microbicides and female condoms which give women the power to protect themselves and a male partner from HIV/AIDS with or without the partner 's agreement , since condoms continue to be the most well known and widely available protection against HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs ) , but require a male partner 's agreement . on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( PT ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to begin by congratulating Mr Seeber on the manner in which he conducted the informal negotiation process
