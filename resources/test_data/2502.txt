On no account should the international community tolerate this , rather it should take a co-ordinated and resolute stand against this on the spot , and under the leadership of KFOR , the organisation that has primary responsibility for public safety .
This indigenous display of moral courage certainly justifies having a European Office for Reconstruction in Pristina .
I consider that to be one of this Parliament ' s important demands .
It makes sense to administer that from within the region too .
So there is no response from the Council .
UNWRA has suffered a great deal on account of financial problems in recent years .
They must assist in integrating the Palestinians into their country .
Yet they took no action , under the pretext of the spurious , hence costly slogan : " Corruption is better than Communism " .
Violent conflict in Dagestan , bomb attacks in Moscow , and all this in the midst of rumours about plots and all kinds of theories as to what is supposed to be behind it all , and all the different associations being made , for example with the forthcoming parliamentary elections and attempts by certain groups to undermine this process .
Indeed the debate we have just had demonstrated this and all we can do is encourage the Russian authorities to restore order with the minimum of violence .
The Russian authorities must enter into political dialogue with the authorities of Chechnya , who must also take responsibility and stop supporting illegal groups in Dagestan .
That is one of the greatest risks which Europe will have to face in coming years and I call upon Parliament , but also the Commission and the Council , to put the debate on Russia and its future in Europe on the agenda , and keep it there .
The conflict has been over for a few months now , but the people are still in captivity .
They speak Albanian , and Kosova is the Albanian word for Kosovo .
That is why I give my full support to the appeal made both by Mr Wiersma and Mrs Pack , and to the compromise resolution before us .
There are now 150,000 refugees in camps , mainly in Thailand but also in Malaysia and India .
Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi has appealed to the western democracies to give her more help .
Mr President , the power struggle in the Islamic Republic of Iran between conservatives and those inclined towards reform continues to rage unabated until today with all the consequences you would expect for the constitutional state , in other words the non-application of the constitutional state ' s basic principles .
The international community , and therefore likewise the European institutions , must rally around the indigenous voices calling for open and just trials for the students and Jews held in captivity .
For it is only in a constructive and transparent climate characterised by goodwill on the part of all the parties concerned , that the national dialogue will have a chance of succeeding .
Mr President , Commissioner , the words spoken by my colleagues show how fragile a peace process is and , at the same time , how important .
That is why , Mr President , Commissioner , I want to make particular reference to the last few paragraphs of our resolution which state emphatically that we must assist with the implementation of the peace agreement .
Madam President , a train service has been axed rather than an additional one laid on .
There is a prestigious building here but no high-speed rail service .
I actually have a few specific questions to do with the building that my voters put to me .
Whilst I do not have any complaints about that , for I was freed half an hour later , I did just want to mention the touching solidarity displayed by my fellow Members of Parliament who could see me through a chink in the door , asked how things were , and on hearing that things were not going well , could not get away fast enough .
It was n' t allowed before , even when there was plenty of room .
In the first place , it has been funded by Community money , be it French or European .
Mr President , I have been fortunate enough to enter two new parliament buildings in the course of my political career .
I think this is a classic example of the injudicious use of the space available .
My country is now having to contend with the consequences of the notorious dioxin crisis .
But since there is a free market and open borders and almost unlimited imports , including those from non-member States I might add , then effective measures must also be taken to impose common safety and environmental standards within the European Union , but also in the countries from which our food imports originate .
I now ask myself if there are still a number of things which we do not suspect of being able to enter the chain but which do , in fact , end up there .
And so I think it is time to set to work on a positive list and , as Mr Florenz said , to ensure that we know what is allowed to be in the food chain and what is not .
I had wanted to ask the Council something else and I think it is a pity that they are not present .
Today , I want to touch on three points which appear to me to be crucial if these guarantees are to be lived up to .
To my mind , it is extremely important for supervision to be undertaken in the same way in all Member States , for there to be guarantees for this supervision , for
