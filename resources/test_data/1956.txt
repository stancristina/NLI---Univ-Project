In fact , there is no justification for the existence of three separate joint supervisory bodies .
There is also a vital need to create a single legal framework in the European Union to provide citizens with sufficient guarantees , essentially by preventing the improper use or dissemination of personal data and by remedying the shortcomings in the current system of protection .
This requires us to establish appropriate mechanisms for protecting our citizens from potential abuses of these rights .
This would create ideal conditions for achieving our stated aims of protecting our citizens ' private life and individual freedoms , without , on the other hand , impeding the free flow of information , which is the hallmark of modern societies .
The Commission is pleased with the initiative that has been taken by the Portuguese Government , as we feel that it will contribute to our efforts to rationalise , in a sensible way , the administrative support provided to the bodies responsible for supervising and guaranteeing data protection established by the Europol Convention , the Convention on the Use of Information Technology for Customs Purposes and the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement .
We must recognise that this is not an easy task , not only because of the sophistication of the technology , but also because it is particularly important for us to find a solution that strikes a balance between safeguarding citizens ' rights and freedoms on the one hand and on the other , having the instruments needed to ensure that the democratic rule of law is respected and that we can effectively fight transnational and organised crime .
Nevertheless , we understand that for the moment , the Council ' s prime concern is that the creation of a new budget heading could cause delays in setting up a joint secretariat .
It is nevertheless worthwhile saying , in line with the views of the rapporteur Mr Pirker and of the Commission itself , how incomprehensible we find it that in the new text , the Council proposes to reserve to itself responsibility for implementing the Eurodac regulation , which departs from the system previously envisaged , in which these powers would fall to the Commission .
Our view is that the generally accepted status of the Commission is still valid : it is the guardian of the treaties , equidistant from each of the Member States ; it is autonomous , independent and the defender of the common good .
Although it is true that this amended proposal did not include all the amendments approved by the European Parliament , it must at least be recognised that some of the suggestions made by Parliament were incorporated .
We will therefore continue to state our position to the Council , which is that we would have a win-win situation if the solution adopted were the one for which the Commission has always fought .
This work can , of course , only be carried out when there is a clear and unassailable legal basis for developing the Eurodac system .
The risks inherent in the building industry are even greater when compared with other , similar sectors .
The risk assessment has been carried out at a snail ' s pace in the European Union , and this second revision is a positive sign that we really want to support and encourage .
Europe cannot at the same time consider itself to be the world ' s leading social model and yet allow people to count for little and for their lives to be reduced to mere statistics .
What is not acceptable is that little more than a year ago , the Financial Perspectives up to 2007 were approved , and now , a few months later , resources that had been earmarked for agriculture are being withdrawn .
This week , the Commission has approved a document on the competitiveness of our exports , which reveals its fundamental position on the various types of export aid .
First of all , it contains a principle which I believe is universally accepted today : that of the jurisdiction of the courts in the Member State in which the defendant is domiciled .
I understand - and I feel that it is important to make this clear to the House - that the proposed regulation is a horizontal instrument , which can be applied , in a general way , to both civil and commercial matters .
Let us move on now to the issue that has aroused the most passion in the debate , which concerns consumer contracts concluded electronically , in other words , the amendments to Articles 15 , 16 and 17 .
Also and above all , it is because the speed with which these contracts are concluded by electronic means is in stark contrast to the excessive formality and slowness with which courts tend to act when resolving these disputes .
Furthermore , we are convinced that it is possible to make use of new communication technologies , such as the Internet , the new network concept and flows to facilitate extrajudicial dispute resolution .
It is because the Commission does , in fact , share the idea that extrajudicial resolution must become the rule but that , in order to provide an incentive for people to seek recourse to this extrajudicial approach , there must be clear principles for the alternative , that is the judicial route .
This action would , however , have two consequences for Article 15 .
I also have in mind contracts where the consumer has been given an incentive , at the initiative of the other party , the co-contractor , even to leave the state in which he or she is domiciled in order to conclude the contract , as happens , for example , in contractual situations involving holidays organised by the
