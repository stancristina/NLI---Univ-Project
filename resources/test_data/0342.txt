in drawing up some kind of morality clause to say that only organizations without convictions will be able to get funding from the EU.
Finally , I would again like to stress that our Community actually needs active , critical , independent voluntary organizations .
Mr President , our group welcomes Mrs Flemming 's report .
We shall , of course , also vote for Amendment No 2 , which clarifies the criteria for the grants .
We think the limits it creates on how these grants can be used are too restrictive .
It is in fact a very important part of the role of environmental organizations to influence public opinion .
These are very serious organizations doing extensive environmental work .
I believe it is entirely wrong to automatically exclude all these organizations through such a formulation .
It is not very many years since the French security service sank one of Greenpeace 's vessels in a New Zealand harbour .
We have talked about telecommunications and universal services from many aspects today in various reports .
We cannot suddenly decide how it will look and what the definition will be .
In addition we have various directives .
I believe this communication from the Commission , together with the directives which already exist , is quite sufficient .
The Council must be prepared to provide information where the treaty is unclear and ambiguous , such as with regard to the refugee question , that is , whether the right of asylum will be restricted and at the same time remain in place .
I am concerned to say the least .
That is , we will not get any information until the debates in the respective Member States are over .
Thank you for your answer .
Sweden and Finland were given a special , new objective within the structural funds in connection with the accession negotiations , objective 6 .
It will be included in objective area 1 .
As far as the plans for Bailers are concerned , I am not actually acquainted with the details .
That is our view .
The Swedish authorities refused to do so because it could not be proven that he had committed a crime .
Mr President , Mr Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , small businesses play a vital role in the creation of prosperity in Europe .
It is also apparent that it is the smallest companies which are hit hardest and are hindered by excessive regulation .
And so I would like to say to Mr Harrison , who was unfortunately forced to rush away from the debate , with all due respect to Gordon Brown and all his initiatives , it was under a Tory government that the UK was the only country in the EU able to show a real upturn in enterprise and new jobs .
I have now sat in this Parliament for two years .
I hope that I will no longer have to see myself waltz around in the internal press and various parliamentary publications like an unparalleled drifter .
I would therefore very much like to ask the President to slow down the tempo and think of us and the interpreters .
Did it have anything to do with the election ?
He had therefore sold it to the Croat house-owner .
From car and helicopter we gained a frightening picture of the destruction in Bosnia .
I admit that I was ashamed of being a human being when I saw in Bosnia how vicious we can be towards our neighbours and work colleagues .
But with international effort , it was possible to carry out the election itself in an acceptable way .
The election has also given Bosnia local leaders with authority to act and think in a new way as a result of the voters ' trust .
This initiative was announced on 28 August .

It is important that we devote resources to this , and that we strive to achieve a lasting reduction .
Today there are great differences in how we will be able to verify or live up to the agreements we are discussing .
The ban will also have different effects in different countries .
As a colleague here has pointed out , Finland only places mines for defensive purposes , against aggression .
Madam President , after the alarm bells which the events of the summer have been , I hope that the debate we have today leads to the Commission recognising how serious the people of Europe are about the conditions in the Baltic Sea , even though only Finns have spoken so far .
The preceding speakers have talked of eutrophication .
We must prevent vessels from dumping more in future .
Madam President , to begin with I would like to say that I am Swedish and am therefore breaking the Finnish domination .
It is therefore unacceptable for the EU to give grants to projects which further contribute to environmental damage .
Can they count on any help from the EU to stop this crazy , large-scale , anti-environmental project ?
Do you think , Mr President , that this method , which is used in a number of countries , is a good way to solve Europe 's problems , as they appear in the statistics , by actually working less ?
The implementation of the budget is gradually getting better and better , but we should not content ourselves with that .
Money has , in fact , been earmarked , but the systems in Sweden and elsewhere mean that the money is not paid out .
May I mention , in parentheses , that the first snows already fell in northern Sweden last week bringing 20 centimetres of snow .
Compare that with Brussels , where it is 20 degrees above freezing , and you can see that it could cause certain problems in northern Sweden .
