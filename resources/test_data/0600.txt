within Europe , something which would be absolutely essential in order for it to succeed .
Our colleague 's report says clearly that monetary sovereignty - he uses the word sovereignty - will reside in Frankfurt .
It is true that everyone recognizes today that monetary policy has an effect on the real economy and that the success of the third phase of Economic and monetary union assumes economic and social cohesion and respect for the objectives set out in Article 2 of the Treaty .
Mr President , on entering Brussels at the moment , you can see a large poster with the slogan , " Let us be concrete and positive ' , with regard to a Belgian political party .
It will also deepen political union and curb warlike nationalism .
It is , on the contrary , an asset .
It is so much more practical to produce in a country with low salaries and a large supply of labour than to make improvements in machinery .
If I add to this the fact that this sector is established in areas which are beset by many serious difficulties , which began with the restructuring of the mining industry , the steel industry and now textiles , you can see how important this issue is and thus how serious this debate is in our regions .
If we want this destructive process to end , we must get to the heart of the problem at all costs and not hesitate to challenge the very statutes of the WTO , where clear evidence of the principles of pernicious decision-making can be found .
Furthermore , owing to a rapid return on investment , liberalization risks leading to preference being given to electricity production based on natural gas , to the detriment of other sources such as nuclear energy .
Differences in the structure of consumption between countries must therefore be taken into account , and the minimum degree of opening up that is decided upon in the agreement consequently seems acceptable to me .
For years we have been told of such experiments and the Member States grant a handful of pittances in order to fool public opinion .
Mr President , given that the implementation of the single currency is nothing but a political fraud , I will not take part in this vote .
Yet I am saying " No ' to the transition to the euro , as it currently stands , and to Mr von Wogau 's report because the minimum democratic and social guarantees are not fulfilled , and because the overall balance presented at Maastricht is not being adhered to .
From now on , monetary and macroeconomic choices will no longer be subject to political arbitration .
Social Europe is on hold , as it was at Vilvorde and sometimes , unfortunately , the orthodoxy of competition at all costs causes unemployment and social decline .
How will parity between the CFA franc and the euro be handled ?
We merely want a period of adaptation for the operators .
In conclusion , on this issue as on many others , we are asking the Commission to be consistent .
However , as a member of the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education and the Media , I would like to repeat the comments of Mr Kerr , our rapporteur .
We are thus going to replace the spontaneous adjustments of the money markets with extremely costly bureaucratic adjustments .
Thirdly , by acting in favour of a massive reduction in the European working week - from this point of view , the wording of Mr Gasòliba I Böhm 's report is completely unacceptable - for a recovery in salaries in Europe and more widely , in order to advance the idea of social convergence little by little , with upwards harmonization of our social standards .
Since Marrakesh , the United States has systematically endeavoured to reduce environmental considerations and consumer protection as much as possible within the framework of the WTO .
Significant efforts have been made by the eleven countries which were finally chosen .
Good sense calls for , or rather demands , a clear and rapid solution ; this is the direction taken by Parliament in its vote last Thursday .
Strong and dynamic economies make for strong and respected currencies and not the opposite .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in giving their definitive consent to the changeover to the single currency , maybe there are some of you who will believe that they are voting in favour of the European Union ?
Our citizens , who are indeed the owners of their currency , are being excluded from this decision to expropriate them ; they are in fact doubly excluded , both now and in perpetuity .
( Loud applause from the extreme right )
This is where the importance of the euro Council comes in ; not , I repeat , to act as some kind of counterbalance to the Central Bank , but to define with it the common objectives of economic policy .
The next reform of our institutions must not ignore that .
The best way of combating that aggressive nationalism is by working together to guarantee our economic and social prosperity .
Instead of a physical standard , we will have a contractual aggregation , defined by administrative rules , but the aims are the same : to prevent a privileged player from acting in an arbitrary way and monopolizing a role essential for the general interest .
