If that is what Europe sets out to do , then I think we are at risk of reverting back to the seventeenth century , which may have been a golden age , but does not , I think , represent what Europe is striving to be .
In order to make these changes , we in the Independence and Democracy Group have tabled two amendments , Amendments 66 and 67 , which I trust you will support . on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , Commissioner , for a long time , we supported developing countries in all kinds of areas , except for that of trade .
The diversification of products makes for a more stable economy .
It is because of these problems that the ACP countries are not operating within the world economy ; if anything , they are moving away from it .
We are familiar with the technical discussion , but as we see it , disregarding bananas and sugar - as these have been taken out of the equation in practice , not least by us - this is very much a real alternative to the current trade conditions .
Secondly , I am a Dutchman .
The European Union has not attempted to trivialise the conflict .
Healthcare - just like other social services of general interest - often forms part of a national structure of social protection which ensures that the citizens ' fundamental rights are safeguarded .
To date , the Generalised System of Preferences ( GSP) has guaranteed the ACP countries preferential access to the EU market , with lower import tariffs at the EU 's borders and better market access .
Whether the EPAs will have a positive or negative impact remains to be seen .
We held stimulating debates , which were a great source of inspiration to me at the time .
I would like to start my statement about how I see Europe 's future with the idea that the Union is a rare and successful project .
Step by step , we are facing new challenges , building on our achievements , but always with a keen eye on the public 's expectations and concerns .
It all went very quickly - for some , too quickly .
It is that , of course .
If you think this through , these issues can , to some extent , be resolved in a new Treaty .
Before I turn to the things that the Netherlands hopes to find in a new Treaty , I should like to make a point .
No more , no less .
First of all , the successful method of changing the Treaty must be continued : improving Europe step by step , with a view to striking a balance .
The institutional proposals of the Constitutional Treaty are a step in the right direction .
The Commission 's right to initiative is infringed upon .
As you , Mr President , told me recently , the European Parliament and the national parliaments complement each other .
Where necessary , we must , therefore , dare take the step towards majority decision-making .
In matters such as the pension system , social security and education , however , the Member States seek to tailor these to the national situation .
As this is something that affects public support for Europe , it is necessary to include the criteria in the new Treaty .
In his declaration of 9 May 1950 , he said - and I quote - ' Europe will not be made all at once , or according to a single plan .
With regard to your interpretation of the 'no' , you only mention those objections to the Constitution that lead to a less ambitious Treaty , in other words , to fewer changes .
This situation is comparable to that of an unsatisfied customer who goes back to the bicycle shop and says 'fine , you can swap the bike , but only for a scooter '.
( Applause ) Unlike the ECHR , the European Charter of Fundamental Rights also contains social fundamental rights , which can put up a barrier against anti-social interventions from Brussels in the welfare state .
This sort of talk goes down well here , for this is a place where democracy is mainly seen on a large scale and from up above .
This is different from the constitutional text that calls for an ever more far-reaching liberalisation of services and free , unadulterated competition .
First of all , I appreciate your efforts in respect of the Constitution 's aspirations to do such things as introduce the position of a permanent president ; such a person would soon develop into a European President , and so I would propose a rota system for three presidencies , each lasting one and a half years , made up of one large , one medium-sized and one small Member State .
( Applause ) Mr President , I am very much obliged to those Members of Parliament who have spoken for their inspiring contributions .
We see changes in the areas of security , the fight against terrorism , the climate issue and energy .
Energy is not just a matter of its presence , energy is also related to stability .
In order to achieve this , we had to take action .
The Treaty of Nice is not enough to meet the requirements of the 21st century .
Let us turn this into a credible project .
That is when the period of reflection will come into its own .
If you talk about the Charter , then you can join our camp , because we are equally persuaded of the importance of fundamental rights .
I have made suggestions to this effect in my presentation .
I think we owe it to
