on my e-mail .
If unsolicited advertising eventually really does take off , I foresee a situation where many people will turn away from the open Internet and e-mail .
The second question concerns the nature and storage of traffic data .
We are still lagging behind and we must establish a semblance of order .
That is the question before us and we must give it further consideration .
Of course we do not see the providers as tracing services and for that reason the restriction of the nature of traffic data and the term for storing traffic data are of essential importance .
We are talking today about the limitations of introducing on the market and using certain hazardous substances and preparations , especially flame retardant agents such as pentabromodiphenyl ether .
Risk assessments have shown , as Mrs Ries has just said , that the use of pentabromodiphenyl ether carries risks for the environment and public health , because this bromide-based , flame retardant agent is used in the production of furniture and upholstery .
For octaBDE , however , I share the opinion of Mrs Ries that the use of this substance must be banned forthwith , even though the assessment of the risks is not yet concluded .
What ' s in a name ?
This matter shows yet again that the current chemical policy with a substance-by-substance analysis takes years and that as a result the authorities are in a very weak position for protecting human beings and the environment .
Besides self-supply within the Union , this is the voluntary and unpaid provision of blood and blood products .
If we start meddling with this principle , that will have a disruptive effect on the public bloodbanks which we are familiar with in a number of Member States .
This is a commendable effort which is in line with the expectations of both consumers and those who are involved in other ways .
On these , our view differs slightly from that in the report , but that was also apparent in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .
Furthermore , people have already had bad experiences with pledges from organisations which make their money through direct marketing .
It is too precarious at this stage to carve up responsibilities among different authorities .
Before the proposed reform can take place , the Commission must lay a foundation in the form of guidelines , or legislation which safeguards legal certainty .
In those countries , the euro will at best be the currency for the rich and foreigners and have a role similar to that of the American dollar in many countries .
Behind the guise of 'land reforms ' the so-called 'veterans ' loot and occupy white-owned farms at will .
I should like to take this opportunity to second the proposal of Mr Van Orden to put forward this man ' s name for the award of the Sakharov Prize .
A few days before , his host , Mr Ghaddafi , had given him an oil loan of USD 360 million and a gift of USD one million for his election fund .
I think , however , that Europe , in particular , must encourage Africa to condemn Mr Mugabe , because if we are not careful that situation may spread to other countries in the region .
Finally , I should like the Commission to investigate whether the rumour is true that people from Zimbabwe enabled to study at European schools and universities , are mainly selected from the circles of Mugabe and his henchmen .
Consequently I am disappointed by the attitude of the European Union , which is unable to adopt a coherent stand in respect of Zimbabwe and to take the necessary measures on Zimbabwe that are required to consign the government of Mr Mugabe to the past , and to give a chance to the hope for a new age .
Unfortunately , that is not yet the case in the United Kingdom .
It surprises me that the British government is only now considering using vaccination .
Controls on our outer borders were inadequate .
Finally I should like to know something about the costs .
The situation in Great Britain is special , since the whole question of rebate is taken into consideration , but how much does the Commission estimate that this has cost up to now ?
Mr President , in my country , financial subsidies to farmers are cut back drastically if they have made minor mistakes and have had foot-and-mouth disease .
The imprisoned politicians were kept incommunicado for a long period and then taken to prison 800 km from the capital , so that they can receive almost no visitors .
We cannot continue giving aid and maintaining intensive trade relations as if there were no problem .
A ludicrous cult of personality is designed to give the Head of State a quasi-divine status .
The question is whether or not we would then contribute to the organisation of a democratic farce , designed solely to give those in power a semblance of legitimacy .
On the contrary , the repression is simply continuing .
They must also be applied consistently and that also applies to a country like France .
I am far from being so enthusiastic .
Voter registration has been halted , so that 30 % of the electorate cannot even take part in the elections .
Their first port of call when they leave the country is generally one of the refugee camps in Pakistan and Iran , where they live in appalling conditions .
It is thanks to such humanitarian help that we can retain a vague hope in a better future .
We might have wished that Australia would use its political weight to condemn the regime in Afghanistan and to spur the international community on to constructive action .
