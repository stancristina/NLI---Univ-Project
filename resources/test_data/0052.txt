detection of mines placed in the ground .
Mr President , years ago when the international campaigns for landmine-clearance began , it used to be said that landmines were the poor countries ' atomic bomb .
I must stress that for this to occur the effort of the European Union must be more cohesive , bringing in Finland and Greece ; the European Union must coordinate all its power to exert international pressure on those countries that have not yet accepted the Ottawa Convention ; and the European effort must become more effective , for example through an increase in funding , taking into account the need for safe mine clearance , the systematic destruction of existing stockpiles and the further development of advanced mine detection and clearance technologies .
Secondly , nor do I agree with the indiscriminate generalisation of qualified majority voting , a measure which if divorced from the others on the table may conflict with important national interests , and which even contradicts the request expressed in Paragraph 7 of the resolution .
I voted for this resolution because in it Parliament wisely does not opt for the 'imperialist ' theses of the large , populous European countries against the self-affirmation of the others .
The experience of a full democracy in the European Union has everything to gain from the approval of a Constitution that is clear , simple , readable and a source of reference for all citizens .
In such a sensitive matter , boldness and prudence should go hand in hand .
Strangely , many MEPs and even Prime Minister Blair support a European Constitution .
The European Parliament and especially the Group of the European People ' s Party and European Democrats has always helped push the outermost region concept to the forefront .
We now look forward to initiatives from the Commission and from the national and regional authorities .
This could be rectified through the approval of a draft amendment that we tabled for this purpose in due time .
We have to bear in mind the type of practices employed in farming and the food industry , the problem of imported foodstuffs , the composition of the ingredients of animal feedingstuffs , the maximum levels of dioxins and pesticide residues , food additives and other matters , giving priority to food safety .
In Angola , the government and UNITA are waging one of the cruellest civil wars in Africa , and unfortunately it is clear that international aid to the Luanda government in particular has played a part in perpetuating this conflict .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , eight years on from Rio de Janeiro and three years on from Kyoto it is no exaggeration to say that the dossier on climate change has now reached its most critical moment , its real moment of truth , for two basic reasons : first , because at an institutional level COP-6 , which will take place in The Hague this November , is to draw up the Kyoto Protocol in its final form and initiate the Protocol ratification stage so that it can come into force by the ' Rio Plus Ten' Conference , i .e . by 2002 .
Let us begin by examining the Green Paper on 'emissions trading ' .
Secondly , this system will help provide an easier remedy to the situation that most Member States are in today of not meeting their targets .
One : the Green Paper should have set quantified targets for greenhouse gas reduction to be attained by the emissions trading system ; in other words , the Green Paper should have said what percentage of greenhouse gas reduction would be allocated to emissions trading .
To this end I invite the Commission to present a plan in a forthcoming communication specifying how those countries can be brought into the emissions trading system .
It is also a disappointment because this communication results in an unbalanced treatment of the various economic sectors ; in particular it was hoped that those sectors that were not included in the emissions trading system might see the approval of an ambitious approach with well-defined commitments in the other communication , the one on policies and measures .
If Bush wins , all the agreements we make in The Hague with the Clinton administration may be totally ignored by the new administration .
I should like to close , Mr President , by thanking all the Members , particularly the draftsmen of opinions and shadow draftsmen , for having made it possible to reach a broad consensus on the strategy for halting climate change .
The amendments tabled by the rapporteur , Mr Jov√© Peres , therefore deserve our support , since they seek to correct the unacceptable views held by the Commission , specifically in its proposals against increasing aid to farmers , on increasing thresholds and on resetting ceilings for aid to producer organisations .
I think that what is needed is an increase of the kind proposed by the rapporteur .
The European Union ' s fruit and vegetable producers are at the moment basically living from their income from the market , in other words , from what they sell on the market .
Furthermore , the haste with which this liberalisation of the highly profitable telecommunications sector is going ahead , following the conclusions of the Lisbon Summit , does not augur well for the protection of consumers ' interests or the interests of people working in the sector .
These are : the inflexibility of the current system for processed tomato-based products , the quantity levels guaranteed for processed tomato , pear and citrus-based products , the complexity of the operational fund system and the management of export refunds .
