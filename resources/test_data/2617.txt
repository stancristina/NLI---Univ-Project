There are plenty of reasons for this : the first is the Commission 's duty to defend the principle of Community preference and , as a corollary , all the standards that guarantee it ; the second is the obligation to ensure fair market conditions for Community producers with high production and transport costs , and for whom the loss of the European market would mean serious economic damage ; the third is the duty to uphold the agreements with the ACP countries .
The common organization of the banana market has not had a moment 's peace in its short life : it has been subject to all kinds of attacks , both in the legal arena and in the battle for public opinion .
Can they have such a decisive influence on Europe too ?
And here I believe the United Nations and above all the European Union need to play a fundamental role , taking responsibility for the political and social reconstruction of Zaire .
In addition , a measure of this kind would restrict freedom of movement of goods and services through a region of the Union , irrespective of which , and that could constitute a violation of the Treaty of Rome .
A young person from the Maghreb cannot .
Mr President , I just want to point out that up to now the Council has been governing the activities of the European Foundation for the Development of Skills Training as far as the CEECs are concerned , but it is also the responsibility of the Council to govern the activities of the same Foundation for the Mediterranean countries , as agreed in Barcelona .
All the reports relate in one way or another to essential foreign waters and their different forms of access and regulation , either through traditional fisheries agreements with third countries - like Sao Tom√© and Principe , in the Macartney report , regional multilateral agreements like NAFO , referred to in the Teverson report , or the New York Agreement on straddling stocks and highly migratory stocks , for which I am rapporteur .
Finally , it needs to be highlighted that this policy , so beneficial to the European Union 's interests , takes under 30 % of total Community resources allocated to fishing , a mere 0.31 % of the total Union budget .
Secondly , but very important , there is the question of responsibility , and several Member States have already objected in the Council to the European Commission 's position .
So codes of conduct between the Community and the Member States would be better than legal rules .
But there is concern about other aspects which are still not functioning entirely satisfactorily and the document takes this up .
You will appreciate that it is our right and our duty to defend the powers of this Parliament , and article 43 is considerably diminished by your proposal , so we shall continue to whittle away at it .
So we have a solid package .
When the resources allocated to fisheries are so limited and the intention is to reduce them further , that seems irresponsible to me because of the tremendous effects they are going to have on people and even on maintaining the quality and quantity of fish in the sea .
It generates activity and employment in areas where there are usually few economic alternatives .
The resources intended for these fisheries agreements , which must be financed by the Community budget , are not sufficient .
And they mean we have to try to find alternatives in second and third generation fisheries agreements .
This is also a good time to think about the future of the Community fisheries agreements , which have frequently been attacked from myopic political positions based on partial analysis of the relative participation of the Member States , sometimes on imaginary conflict with development policy , and occasionally on dubious reasoning associated with fairly unsound cost-benefit analysis .
And we must do so without abandoning the necessary improvement in the institutional procedures which will sharpen Parliament 's protagonism in the context of this policy .
Even if it does not have great incidence on the whole Community , fishing is a vital economic activity for the development of certain peripheral regions with income levels below the Community average and high levels of unemployment , regions where fishing is the principal activity and whose socio-economic structure would fall apart if they could not count on the international fisheries agreements .
Trade benefits both parties and so do the international fisheries agreements .
There are many projects currently being developed throughout the world for new power stations in Iran , Turkey , Brazil , Korea and China .
Yet no-one admits that nuclear energy does this .
And now we too , today 's mankind , in the 20th century and at the dawn on the 21st century , we also ask not be deprived of the sun .
Personally , I am going to vote in favour of the second part because I believe that not only do we lack an energy chapter - for which the Commissioner is now working so much , and I myself must recall that I drafted a report which went in that direction some years ago - because otherwise we shall have to introduce the theme of renewable energies into the Community legal framework .
Therefore , much of the debate has already taken place .
Only if the European Parliament receives a satisfactory response setting out in detail the reasons for which the Commission has not decided to take proceedings , will it be possible for the European Parliament to accept the way in which the system works .
We do not like the Helms-Burton Act .
However , there is one question which I must put to him and that is why the Commission , which has lost the argument over
