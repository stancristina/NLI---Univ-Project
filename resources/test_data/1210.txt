for toys that meet the safety requirements to be imported into and sold in the EU , irrespective of whether they have been manufactured in the EU or in Asia .
When a country exports defence-related products it takes a particular stance on foreign and security policy issues by so doing and it must be able to take responsibility for this .
Let us not allow this to happen .
Thank you for the opportunity to speak .
The intention of the report is to amend a previous regulation , Regulation (EC ) No 1338/2001 laying down measures necessary for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting , and to increase powers in order to facilitate and permit transfer between Member States of counterfeit money that is to be used to adjust the relevant checking equipment .
Sweden and other Member States outside the euro area should not involve themselves in the euro area countries ' handling of the matter .
We have our doubts about the proposed appropriation of EUR 262 million .
Now it wants to march in with emergency aid as a short-term solution .
This does not mean that we support the proposal in this amending budget for emergency aid .
I therefore voted against the report .
The June List also questions the rapporteur 's urging of the European Parliament to encourage continued economic activity outside the tourist season , a proposal that can scarcely be described as anything other than an attempt to establish cross-border employment protection .
The proposals in the report violate the principle of subsidiarity .
We do not want a common European media education for all children in the Member States .
The rapporteur seeks to introduce European media education at various levels , aimed at families , schools , older people and people with disabilities .
We believe that media literacy is a matter for the Member States .
In grand speeches much is said about subsidiarity , but the reality is rather different .
However , we do not believe that the EU should legislate on how trade in defence-related products within Europe 's borders should be controlled .
As the June List is strongly opposed to any attempt to establish military capability within the framework of EU cooperation , we are highly critical of the Commission 's proposal .
It is yet another step towards military cooperation within the EU , the aim being to establish common defence .
We believe that peace , democracy and human rights are more important than the creation of a new market for military equipment .
For the reasons given above , we are voting against the proposal .
We understand that the administrative burden needs to be proportionate to the amounts concerned .
We have absolutely nothing against ensuring that assistants in the European Parliament have reasonable salaries and working conditions .
Neither MEPs nor their assistants should be isolated in an 'EU bubble ' with high salaries and attractive benefits way above the reality experienced by the citizens they are supposed to represent .
We therefore voted against this proposal for an EU statute for assistants .
However , we have reservations about the proposal in paragraph 13 regarding the extension of the scope of Directive 2005/29/EC .
Institutional competition between Member States is fundamental to solving problems exactly like the one dealt with in this report .
A lot of the negotiations have been carried out in the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy and I would like to mention in particular some of the things included in the final negotiation results .
The system has become more open and transparent with a prohibition on insider trading , and this ensures credibility and effectiveness .
I find this regrettable , but I will nevertheless recommend that you vote in favour , as the cost of not having a climate package in place is infinitely higher .
Many of us would like to go further , but let us remember that at the same time there are many people who do not believe in the effects on the climate , who do not want a decision and who would have gladly deferred any action , any management and , above all , the vote that we are to take tomorrow .
It is clear that more emission allowances will be sold at auction .
From Parliament 's point of view , we will keep them under observation and we will hunt down with a blowtorch any who break the promises they have made here .
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will support all of the proposals included in the package .
We must put a stop to this .
Consequently , I am disappointed that as much as half of the EU 's emission reductions will be made in other countries by means of what are referred to as flexible mechanisms .
This was never the intention of the Commission on Climate Change and Development , which talked about the flexible mechanisms merely as complementary measures .
The proposal does , at any rate , result in an improvement in the ill-functioning system that we have at present .
This will mean that Europe 's emissions will have to be decreasing all the time .
There is a lot of talk , but very little action when it really counts .
However , what we are to vote on now is a lost opportunity .
What will become of Parliament 's requirement of 95 g per kilometre by 2020 ?
If this is adopted , we in the GUE/NGL Group are prepared to support this .
Once again the PPE-DE Group and the PSE Group have chosen to ride roughshod over the rest of us .
As regards the Socialist Group , this agreement demonstrates that they are increasingly starting to resemble their environmentally unfriendly political opponents in the PPE-DE Group
