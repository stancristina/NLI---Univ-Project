like – and not just on my own behalf , I believe – to express our indignation and outrage at the Russian Government’s policy in Chechnya .     Mr President , on this matter the European Commission has chosen an illegitimate course of action , which has taken away the European Parliament’s powers by well and truly surrendering European sovereignty to the United States of America .
It also claims that the Commission exceeded its powers and calls on it to withdraw its decision .
Even that characteristic bitterness towards Slovenia no longer exists .
I believe there is a danger , which was mentioned a little while ago , of seeing people get disappointed .
Therefore , in view of the recurrent infringements denounced in these reports and in the absence of sanctions , it is inevitable that we shall yet again see this picture deteriorate even further next year .
We also reject Amendment No 157 , which adds to this demand the right even to be able to adopt children normally .
They carried out some research in Italy in April 2003 , which they later published , in which they arrive at very different conclusions from those that characterise yesterday’s unbelievable report from the Committee on Citizens ’ Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , with its even more unbelievable amendments .
We call on Germany to compensate those Italian citizens who worked hard against their will in factories and labour camps , even though it is now really very late .
It is surely inevitable that , when databases are set up to store a large amount of information , there is then a temptation to use them for a wide variety of purposes .
This may be useful and legitimate on certain conditions , particularly with regard to the citizens ’ fundamental right to the protection of their personal data , as enshrined in Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union .
Besides , I cannot see what urgent need there is to allow direct access to Schengen data , given that this would not be allowed for any registration bodies that were private rather than public in nature under the rules of different countries .
This is a very serious precedent .
Here I can say it freely and no one , thank God , will silence me : down with thieving Rome !
Before Easter , Mr President , I wrote to you to submit a series of points that , from a procedural and regulatory point of view , do not seem to me to be in line with our Rules of Procedure .
You understand that at the basis of democracy , and even more so for a Parliament that is the ultimate embodiment of democracy , it is inconceivable that obligations provided for by the Rules of Procedure should be avoided by using majority voting .     I agree with you , Mr President .
This is a completely unfounded allegation .
Clearly , since they were tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , the amendments will have the support of a tenth of the Members and , therefore , having carried out this check , we will have fulfilled the task given to us by the President .     Mr President , this session is particularly complicated but unfortunately the world is also complicated .
This controversy has been going on for a year and the Commission , even now , repeatedly says that the directive has not been amended , but on this basis it has been breached .
Of course , it has not specifically voted on resorting to the Court of Justice but this , in my opinion , is a necessary consequence .
The reasons underlying the directive , which is designed to achieve higher consumer protection , are of an economic nature , and therefore relate to the completion and smooth operation of the internal market .
In this regard , we have tabled an amendment concerning the legal basis , that is , a proposal to include , in addition to the legal basis proposed by the Commission in relation to the internal market , a legal basis based on Article 153 concerning consumer protection , so that we can reconcile the objective of harmonisation and mutual recognition of the internal market with the possibility for the Member States to maintain legislation which goes further to protect consumers .
I will conclude by thanking all my fellow Members who sought to improve this document and find a solution with their contributions .
The authority of one Member State may request help from other members of the network in order to investigate possible infringements , to receive information and thereby to end exploitation by dishonest traders .
There are two fundamental objectives sought by the Commission by reforming company law in Europe : strengthening shareholders ’ rights and third parties ’ protection ; fostering efficiency and competitiveness of businesses .
I believe that the challenge that we must meet today is to aim to bring out the distinctive , characteristic features of European capitalism in the age of globalisation .
In other words , we need to ascertain whether there is a true European model , which differs significantly from the North American model , not because it corresponds with and emerges from a framework of challenges and issues other than those which concern everyone in a context of economic globalisation , but because it considers social consequences and implications , making it more balanced and more human : a model , therefore , which seeks to conceive of the essential core of the corporate model , represented by a company ’s interests , not just as the common interest of members and shareholders but as the interest of the company itself , a company which , as an independent economic operator , is also responsible for the specific interests of all parties outside and within the company itself
