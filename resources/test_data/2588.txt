Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , this week , Parliament will decide - or at least I hope so - to set up a committee of inquiry to shed light on certain aspects of the issue of so-called mad cow disease .
On 3 June , my colleague Mr des Places made a call for genuine solidarity with cattle breeders , and for those responsible - in the cattle-feed manufacturing industry , in governments and in the Community institutions - to be identified .
Naturally , we agree with Mr de Villiers .

Whether or not we have been successful is a matter for debate , as we have already heard from several colleagues .
I commend the rapporteur and our colleagues who took part in the many meetings of the conciliation committee on their dedication and their excellent work .
We shall therefore have to collaborate with our neighbours in developing the various links by rail , inland and coastal navigation , and combined transport .

In fact , this opinion contains two serious defects .
In particular , the June 1996 text , which marked the conclusion of the work of the Steering Committee - before it goes to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe , probably next autumn - to a large extent takes account of the criticisms which had been made , for example in Germany , where translation errors had distorted the debate .
This subject calls for reflection on our part as the scope of biological technology is extended .
I would add that the Intergovernmental Conference may also cause some changes to be made to the Treaty .
To this effect , I have tabled a proposed form of words which could extend the powers of the Bureau provided for in our report .
We cannot accept that certain gifts or benefits may be permissible , nor financial support allowed .
It also gives me an opportunity to offer my personal congratulations to Mr Ford for having come up with some provisions which , though they may not go far enough for some people here , nevertheless allow the process of clarification to begin on a sound footing .

That , Mr President-in-Office , is why I would like to concentrate on essentials , and especially on the work of the IGC , where we will need to start thinking about forms of differentiation .
