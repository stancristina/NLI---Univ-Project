to ensure that there is no distortion of the market and to report back to the Council and to Parliament .
We asked them to report , in the meantime , on a number of aspects : ensuring equal treatment of companies , looking at the choice of location , harmonising of international regulations and the possibility of establishing a clearing system , as was suggested by the rapporteur .
Another point we made , that was not made elsewhere , was that , as many may recall , Al Capone was gaoled not as a gangster but for tax evasion .
We see an unfortunate boom in aspects of e-commerce , in the growth of pornography , paedophilia and race-hate material .
The Industry Committee believes that registration for VAT will enable us to subject the companies concerned to the rigours of EU law on these matters .
This in itself may make the directive worthwhile .
Mr President , on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee I would like to address the same report as Mr Ford has addressed .
On the face of it this proposal would seem to be about taxation of non-EU businesses , but , of course , what it should be about is how we encourage and nurture Europe 's e-economy , which is a very fragile flower .
In this sense , I welcome the Commission 's brave attempt to find a way to close the competitive gap that clearly exists between EU and non-EU e-business .
But what we have to ask , and what our committee asked , was : is this the right way to do it ?
Our opinion was very clearly that it is not .
I was always told that one of the first rules or principles of a legislator should be : do not make law you cannot enforce .
This was our committee 's major concern .
It may not be enough to rely on the good will of enterprises outside our reach .
The good guys will comply , the bad ones will still be bad , and consumers may well use them in their search for a good deal .
What else could we be doing here ?
There is much talk about setting up business models for e-commerce regulation , but that is a wider issue and should be dealt with in a much more transparent way .
There are underlying assumptions in this proposal about the place of taxation which could store up problems for the future in an international context .
We may have something to learn from America , where they have , of course , imposed a moratorium on such e-tax .
In short , the aim of this proposal is correct but the method is misconceived and if we really want to encourage Europe 's e-economy , a right signal would be zero rate VAT for our own e-business rather than trying to impose our problems on others .
Mr President , very few issues among the growing band of United Kingdom Euro-sceptics excite as much interest as VAT , this being one of the concrete examples of the European Union interfering in domestic tax matters .
The tax itself embodies many of the features of the European Union which makes it so unloved in my country : it is complicated , bureaucratic , difficult and expensive to administer and , in the UK at least , enforced by a draconian and unpopular inspectorate .
On Parliament 's report , I find myself in complete disagreement with virtually every single word .
I cannot , for instance , see why the introduction of the euro should require further or even any coordination of VAT rates .
I do not see the introduction of a common system of VAT as a priority and I do not agree that the introduction of a common system is long overdue .
In fact , nothing would please me , my party and the bulk of business people in the United Kingdom more than the complete abolition of VAT.
We would prefer a simpler levy on retail goods .
Moreover , we would prefer to determine our own taxes and reject the idea of a common tax system .
Therefore , as to the Commission 's proposal to extend the timescale the reform is introduced , I can only express my neutrality .
But as to reducing that time , as the rapporteur proposed , I have to oppose .
I oppose Mrs Torres Marques ' call for harmonisation of VAT , but what I would really like to address is the García-Margallo report on e-commerce .
While I applaud Mr García-Margallo 's heroic efforts on aircraft fuel , I am afraid I cannot agree with his stance on VAT in e-commerce because I think that the Commission 's proposal sends out the wrong signal .
We should be thinking out ways to encourage e-commerce and not thinking up new ways in which to tax it .
The de facto tax-free status of much US e-commerce must have had a tremendous impact in encouraging the new economy and its phenomenal success in the US.
This tax is unenforceable , why should we spend the time and the money and the effort on creating a tax that we cannot collect .
The very day a respectable dot.com starts levying VAT , a less respectable dot.com will set up selling exactly the same products without VAT and that is where the customers will go .
The proposal is arguably inconsistent with the Ottawa Accord because it provides for different rates for on-line and off-line equivalent products such as , for example , newspapers which would enjoy a reduced rate in their off-line physical form .
It will be almost impossible for e-businesses to work out the VAT status of their customers and impossible to work out whether their customers are based in the EU , whether they are businesses or not .
