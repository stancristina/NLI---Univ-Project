which deals with disabilities .
The Commissioner presented in great detail the views of the European Commission for the part of the report which concerns the Commission .
However , Europe means precisely its citizens ; it means precisely its institutions .
The right to petition is one of the most important tools in highlighting a social and people-orientated Europe .
Indeed , we must inform the citizens better of our existence and , in all events , the Commission and the Council or the Member States must stop fearing further cooperation with us .
The debate was held not only for symbolic and anniversary reasons ; it was a political choice by our committee to sound once again the alarm bell for principles , security and the protection of human rights , women 's dignity and the image of Europe in the eyes of its citizens and in the eyes of the citizens of the entire world .
I am delighted , Commissioner , that you share our positions on the extent of this phenomenon and on the need to combat it with every preventive and repressive measure in the host country and in the countries of origin .
However , the specific situation which has arisen in Germany constitutes an opportunity for us to check how aware we are and how determined we are to become effective , both the political agencies and society , by which I mean society in the Member States and the European community .     – Mr President , Commissioner , I fear that you have confined yourself – and that we have confined ourselves – to statements , descriptions , studies and more remote , future policies on the taking of fundamental decisions on combating forced prostitution gangs .
Even in your references to the work of the German Government , which truly is an achievement today , these days , you did not clarify how the national local authorities should work in order to dismantle or combat these gangs at once and not with cross-border cooperation now that the goods have left the factory gate .
Because FIFΑ may consider that forced prostitution is bad advertising for these football matches .
It is fighting a huge fight with no means of communication .
Groundwater is also of great environmental value .
Secondly , it imposes the application of measures to prevent or limit the immediate ingress of dangerous substances into groundwater .
In this instance , the Commission considers that the Nitrates Directive , the Water Framework Directive and the present directive pursue the same objectives as regards the prevention and limitation of contamination from nitrates .
Over 2/3 of drinking water comes from reserves of groundwater and a great deal of damage has already been done .
My political group considers that the directive we are debating on the protection of groundwater constitutes the most important legislative tool for maintaining clean groundwater in Europe .
What is needed is for the Council to agree at long last , because if we leave it to the discretion of the Member States to prevent the contamination of groundwater from dangerous substances , we shall set this issue a long way behind existing legislative texts whereas , on the contrary , we need to push forward , to deal effectively with serious pollution from nitrates and to become more effective in our prevention policy .
Amendments 12 , 18 and 23 propose provisions for maintaining the status quo as regards the quality of groundwater .
In addition , maintaining the status quo is not in keeping with the requirements of the Water Framework Directive , in accordance with which the quality of groundwater must be managed so as to prevent any deterioration .
As regards programmes of measures to reverse trends in concentrations of nitrates of agricultural origin , it should be noted that the relevant provisions of the Nitrates Directive still cover these programmes , in which case there is no need for them to also be included in this directive , which is why the Commission can accept Amendment 43 .
However , it must be incorporated into the general administrative structure of the Water Framework Directive .
Similarly , Amendments 24 , 25 , 28 and 29 concern matters already covered by the Water Framework Directive and consequently cannot be accepted .
To close , may I say that the Commission accepts 9 amendments in full and another 19 in principle or in part .
I should also like to again thank the rapporteur , Mrs Klaß , on her excellent work .     Mr President , I should like to start by thanking the rapporteur , Mrs Brepoels , on her excellent work on the proposal being debated .
Agricultural and regional policy , for example , rely in particular on the existence of spatial information .
In this way , the potential offered by modern technology as regards access to the information we need can be developed in the best possible way .
The most basic issues are as follows : the degree to which the public will have electronic access to spatial information , the removal of barriers to common use of spatial information between public authorities and the comitology procedure for the introduction of implementing rules .
Given that many of the Member States continue to have reservations as regards basic issues , it is clear that they will demand concessions on both sides .
The public agencies will be able to find information more easily and , of course , the citizens will be able to access sensitive data , so as to formulate an opinion and be able to participate in real consultation procedures .
The Commission is therefore in a position to accept the amendments in question in full .
Nonetheless , there are – as I said earlier – certain categories of data which it is financially difficult for information providers to provide free of charge
