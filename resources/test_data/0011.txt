Genetically modified crops are currently being grown on over 50 million hectares of land around the world .
Community law already contains regulations concerning the labelling of threshold values for unintentional occurrence .
I repeat that the Commission fully supports the principle of establishing threshold values for unintentional occurrence , as proposed in a number of amendments .
Mr President , I would like to emphasise what Mr Sakellariou said regarding the Speaker of the Taiwanese Parliament and the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Common Security and Defence Policy .
How do you think this is perceived by the rest of the world ?
If a Swede or a Greek living in Denmark wants to bring his 18-year old fianc√©e from home , there will most likely be no problem .
You cannot want to drive away so-called aliens and , at the same time , seek to expand freedom of movement in the EU to cover all European countries , some of which are Muslim .
Is it not going a little too far to try to manipulate the Irish referendum results out of existence ?
I can see Denmark from my window .
During the Swedish Presidency , we carried the baton a long way forward .
I hope you will not incline too much towards the US , for example on environmental issues .
In this context , I would like to refer to a report by Mr Haarder , in which Member States were urged , in conjunction with the development of a common asylum system , to go one step further than the minimum levels for harmonisation by adopting high standards of protection as the basis for future asylum systems However , Denmark has done exactly the opposite in the time that Mr Haarder has been a minister .
Therefore , I am incredibly disappointed in Denmark .
Mrs Van Lancker 's report contains much that we in the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats think is good and important .
We also voted in favour of Amendment No 7 which clearly explains our position .
The issue of abortion does not belong at European level , as public health matters fall within national competence .
This item shows that the European Parliament is clearly not prepared to show any regard for the fact that a number of Member States , including Ireland , Portugal and Germany , consider that abortions directly contradict the principle of the State 's primary task of protecting life , especially the lives of the defenceless .
Carrying out such a unilateral and dangerous power policy not only undermines relations with Europe , but also - which is worse - jeopardises and weakens the International Criminal Court .
I appeal to the Commission and the Council to urge the Member States to stand by the decisions taken and stand up for the UN and the ICC.
In 1998 , 120 states voted in favour of such a court - only seven opposed it , including the US.
It is surprising that a country with such a long legal tradition and so many lawyers per square metre as the US can consider exempting its citizens from liability to prosecution for such serious crimes .
This would in effect legalise rape , sexual assault and forced pregnancy , which unfortunately also occur with peacekeeping forces .
Welcome , President-in-Office .
We had invited four Cuban citizens to take part in the meeting , but they were refused exit visas by the Cuban authorities .
A quarter of an hour ago , I received a fax from the Cuban Ambassador , stating that the seminar was an affront to the people of Cuba .
I wonder whether the Danish Presidency is preparing to bring further pressure to bear now that so many different initiatives in favour of democratisation are to be seen .
I would like to thank Mr Haarder for his reply and welcome our former colleague to the European Parliament as the Danish Minister for European Affairs .
It is vital to work together within the EU to strengthen the protection available to victims of xenophobic and racist crimes and to ensure that those responsible are punished and that we remove the loopholes in the law .
Racism must be considered an aggravating factor when punishment is meted out .
This is not the case today .
This is totally unacceptable .
In certain Member States , including my own , freedom of expression and freedom of the press are enshrined in the constitution .
I believe that it is important to bring the matter out into the open to be debated .
Things have started to improve now , so there is cause for hope .
Competition policy is particularly important for small countries , where the risks of monopolies and concentrations of undertakings are obvious .
In my country , we have had a broad discussion on these issues since a number of high-profile intended mergers failed to happen .
I would like to mention a few particular points .
Secondly , acquisition control must become more predictable .
We need more competition .
However , this ignores the local labour markets , the differences between them and their significance .
These are therefore important elements we are talking about , including in economic terms .
If the economy is to bring itself out of the current decline , it is particularly important for local labour markets to be functioning well , as they constitute the bed from which new companies will grow and new activities can be developed .
As such , it is not a question of marginal problems , but of an economically extremely large , significant and important element of the overall employment policy .
The local labour market therefore has an important function as a bridge to other parts of the labour market .
