We were not confronted with the decision-makers themselves - as I like to call the research ministers .
I therefore call upon all Members to vote for the proposal .
Because our farming policy is quite simply the cause of BSE.
Thank you for your generosity !
Let me end by thanking you for this debate .
Manufacturers quite simply want to have a monopoly of this market , and that is not desirable .
The Council has taken the side of the motor companies in this , and in tomorrow 's vote we in Parliament should support the consumer and the free market .
If the repair clause is to be introduced in the form preferred by Parliament , these amendments could in our opinion give rise to uncertainty as to the meaning of the individual details of the clause itself .
There is the possibility that a door has now been opened , through which a majority of European states will later be able to pass in a determined manner .
While the targets set by the Commission , the Council Presidency and the rapporteur too , are quite correct , we still need , in addition to labour-market stimuli and reforms , a quite different economic framework in which to operate .
The debate has gone on long enough , now is the time for action .
It should be made easier to establish new companies .
The objective , or as Commissioner Flynn puts it , the result , is to create 12 million new jobs in five years - an ambitious undertaking , particularly since no additional resources are to be made available .
Here I wish to focus on a number of measures whose implementation is necessary , in my opinion , to combat youth unemployment .
We agree on many points , including those voiced by the President of the Commission .
If political accord can be reached this year within the Council of Ministers on the basis of this partnership solution , then this will also be good for European employment policy .
Those in responsibility find it much easier to send women back to the kitchen or to parttime jobs .
Clearly we need to survey what has been accomplished , but also what remains to be accomplished , and this should include the annual reports submitted to the European Parliament .
Since it is better to have any kind of work than none at all , I now see increasing numbers of people in such a plight that they are forced to accept this type of employment , despite the fact that it involves no social safeguards whatsoever and in terms of workers ' rights falls far short of the benefits enjoyed by full-time workers .
I shall attempt to present my report in less than the allotted 15 minutes , since I am simply unused to speaking for a quarter of an hour in the House .
The President-in-Office has it in his power to convince his colleagues of this , and I call upon him to do so .
Now to structural policy , which has already been mentioned by my colleague Fabra Vallés .
For the sake of transparency the Commission should also be required to show the amount allocated , for example , to the Socrates programme for countries with which association agreements have been concluded .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , if the Commission or the Council were to have their way , then consumer protection and environment policy would have been well and truly blamed for the finances .
Let me now conclude by again thanking the rapporteur .
First a positive example : this year , our budgetary process has centred around the EU 's capacity to act in the fight against unemployment .
Now it is up to the Commission .
Secondly , we have helped make a decisive change to the structure of administrative expenditure .
Letters of amendment after the first reading of the budget in Parliament , no voting motions being placed during the first reading in Parliament , and then a joint procedure in the trialogue prior to the budget 's second reading in the Council - from an institutional viewpoint , that constitutes a decisive step forward .
It is therefore important that we should address ourselves to this matter .
Alien rules only serve to confuse , more bureaucracy only pushes costs higher and impedes transparency .
The question is neither theoretical nor rhetorical .
Mr President , let me begin by complimenting Mr Bösch on his report .
Mr Bösch , who is to be congratulated for producing such an excellent report , is quite right in urging greater cooperation between the Commission and the European Parliament in a number of key areas , and particularly in one which is of great interest to our peoples - namely , what is really happening with Europe 's money and is it being used to best effect .
Do you not sometimes think it contradictory that the Commission should on one hand behave so admirably in informing us of the dangers of cancer , while at the same time providing substantial funds each year , and in fact probably more , for the promotion of tobacco growing - an industry which even from an employment point of view hardly justifies such rewards ?
I am pleased that Commissioner Van den Broek is here , since we are not really discussing detailed transport policy issues in the narrower sense , but rather are dealing with transport infrastructures , both remote and close to home , which are adapted to the needs of the last enlargement process as well as to those of the next .
While I do not share the conclusions which Mr Kaklamanis has drawn from today 's meeting , both Members have gone to some trouble to prepare their reports and
