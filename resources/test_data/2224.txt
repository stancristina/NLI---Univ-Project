We will have to fill this vacuum .
Following the adoption of a single currency , nothing in Europe will be the same again .
Excessive tax and administrative burdens borne in particular by SMEs in the face of increasingly fierce international competition , inadequate vocational training , excessive rigidity of the labour market , preventing the development of new job opportunities and high non-wage labour costs reduce companies ' capacity to invest and grow .
To conclude , owing to its general nature , paragraph 40 seems to be the result of a confused political agreement .
We also need to help highquality products by adopting a policy to support small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector , to increase the fashion content and the quality of the raw materials used .
The first is to promote the mobility of trainees , and in this sense it is included in the subject we are dealing with in this session : the euro helps us to integrate Europe even further , to bring the European Economic Area even closer , to consolidate the internal market , and therefore to consolidate an area in which the free movement of people and , in this context , the free movement of trainees , should actually be promoted .
It is not a new programme , it is a type of work-linked training , it is a means offered as an opportunity to the Member States and therefore implies voluntary acceptance .
With our amendments , we want to promote the actual application of this decision by urging all Member States to take part , even those that have not yet provided for training in their regulations .
The Institute of Apprenticeship , while operating under various procedures in the various Member States , is considered a privileged meeting place between these two worlds and therefore a sector for priority intervention by the Union .
As the European Parliament , we will ensure that the Commission keeps its promises , in the context of the proposed training and educational programmes for future generations .
In my opinion , this is therefore a positive proposal overall , which we should naturally see incorporated into the Green Paper which this Parliament will soon receive and which will constitute the mosaic in which the central problem will be situated .
Moreover , the amendment introduced by Mr Pompidou and accepted by the Desama report , which requires an assessment of the results of this directive over a certain number of years , offers the European Parliament a certain pathway along which to pursue our objectives .
It is hoped that the Council will outline a new common strategy to encourage the adaptation of the sector , on the eve of new liberalization worldwide .
Mr President , Presidents of the Commission and Council , ladies and gentlemen , today , 2 May 1998 , we are celebrating an historic event for Europe and for the whole world : the euro has been born , the new unifying and invigorating symbol , as I see it , for Europe and for our peoples , in a spirit of stability , solidarity and peace .
I think that the decision to set up the monetary union with the Eleven has also been dictated by the belief that the countries structurally furthest behind know how to show that they can transform miracles into serious , continuous and highly responsible recovery and development programmes , in which inflationist and welfarist policies which eat up resources , which will now for better or worse be common policies , finally give way to policies to promote healthy management of public budgets and a strong commitment to economic recovery .
The currency alone cannot loosen the binds that today still torment European society and have not yet allowed political union to get under way .
A technical device such as the euro , essential as it may be , cannot provide a satisfactory answer to unemployment , which requires coordinated strategies and political solutions at Community level .
These threats , which are an attack on our unity , can only be faced once political union has been achieved .
Once again we are forgetting the real origins and foundations of the Union , the role of the communities , the municipalities and the regions .
We will contribute decisively to ensuring that the Union has a real common economic policy and strong representative political institutions .
Just three years ago , Mr President , it was thought that monetary union would relate to five countries .
We have seen in today 's document the product of the work carried out over all these years by Parliament and by all the European institutions .
But today , for now , we can without reservation quote what Gandhi said : " One step at a time is enough for me ' .
Monetarist integration has been demonstrating its limitations for some time : high unemployment among young people , the absence of a common economic policy , widespread crises in the social state , stagnation of environmental policies , increased poverty and marginalization of the weakest .
For me , this represents the fulfilment of a commitment solemnly entered into between me and the electors of Piedmont , Val d'Aosta , Liguria and Lombardy , who genuinely believe in the reasoning behind political and cultural autonomy .
The Secretary of the left-wing Democratic Party , Massimo D'Alema , said a few days ago , " In Italy , there is no freedom of the press ' .
Instead , it has preferred this to be carried out by means of structural reforms and lasting cuts in useless expenditure .
For this and many other reasons , sincere pro-Europeans in Europe should be pleased that Italy is joining the single currency from the outset .
At the time of the Trojan war , the people of Veneto were alongside a people that had been attacked , to defend , along
