What more specific comments can he make about which sectors and which products will be concerned , and for how long ?
That is the sort of message we want to hear .
I wonder whether it would not be a better step forward , in terms both of winning the confidence of the developing countries and of acting as an example to other trading partners , for us , as Europe , to say : " now is the time ; we are going to offer this now .
We do not want to wait for five years ; let others follow our example " .
Question No 45 by (H-0208/00 ) : Subject : China 's accession to the WTO In keeping with the Commission 's opinion on the IGC , would the Commission agree that the accession of China to the WTO represents a sufficiently important agreement to justify invoking the assent procedure of this Parliament ?
Will the Commission agree to submit the agreement on China 's WTO accession to this Parliament 's assent even if the IGC has not yet been concluded ?
Thank you very much for that reply .
Let me reiterate my appreciation that the Commission and Parliament are , for the first time , speaking with one voice on changes to Parliament 's role in important trade agreements .
I just want to ask you a non-legal and institutional question : if we look , for instance , at the decision which was taken to submit the Uruguay Round conclusions to the assent of this Parliament , there were some legal questions relating to the institutional and budgetary implications of the Agreement , but the decision was fundamentally a political recognition that this was an agreement of such importance that the strict boundaries of what was then Article 113 could , so to speak , be overstepped , thus allowing the Agreement to be submitted to Parliament 's assent .
My own view is that the accession of China to the WTO , whilst perhaps not quite as eye-catching as a multilateral agreement , is just as important to the future global trade regime , and that a similarly political position might therefore be taken by both Parliament and the Commission .
I would urge you to do so .
I would ask you what you think we could do together to promote this type of action .
As we are talking about blood-alcohol levels I wonder if the Commissioner , in her recommendation is also going to be looking at the broader issue of drugs ?
This is an important issue that is often left out when we are talking about driving .
Will this ever be put into the recommendation ?
Mr President , whilst recently at my sister-in-law 's house , I noticed that she had a container of "eco-friendly " washing-up liquid .
When I congratulated her on this , she looked rather guilty and admitted that the green bottle now contained normal detergent , as the alternative product was not only more expensive but needed four times as much and even then it did not get the dishes clean ; by refilling the container , she could both do the washing up effectively and impress eco-warrior friends .
The moral of this story is , of course , that to compete in the mainstream market , eco-products must give a performance close to their alternatives .
Only then can these products move out of the niche market they already have and into the mainstream .
The eco-label should not be associated with mediocrity .
The German Blue Angel and the Nordic Swan have led the way in eco-labelling .
To scrap these successful schemes now would be to throw away the baby with the bath water .
In the long term , I can see the merits of the single European eco-label , but this must not be imposed on those with existing schemes .
A single scheme has advantages for business : for example , only one registration fee and inspection , standardised packaging , and advantages for consumers who will not be confused by a plethora of labels .
Eco-labelling is moving on from forest products and detergents to computers and household appliances , but why stop there ?
Services such as tourism and clean taxes could register .
In addition , groups of similar small business could possibly cooperate and register together .
In the United Kingdom , we have a flourishing ethical financial services sector , offering savings and pensions which invest from a green perspective .
These should not only qualify for an eco-label , but be allowed to sell their products without hindrance throughout the EU in a single financial services market .
Mr President , I would also like to congratulate Mr Blokland on this report which will set Europe-wide standards for incineration , including for the first time emission standards for dioxins and furanes ; this should lead to more competition between different methods of waste disposal , and as a result help bring to an end the transport of hazardous waste across Europe in search of the cheapest waste operators .
With the predicted increase in incineration , it is vital that overall EU legislation on waste disposal and on air quality is consistent and comprehensive .
We must look at the whole hierarchy .
Incineration may increase as stricter controls are put on landfill , but it does not go hand in hand with recycling and environmentally friendly waste-disposal methods .
Building new incinerators is a costly and long-term venture which in turn has to have a long-term return for the investors , so it would be in their interests for waste to continue to be burned .
This means that there is a danger of over capacity which will lead to encouraging incineration for reasons of profit , rather than encouraging the reduction , recycling and safe treatment of waste , which is our goal
