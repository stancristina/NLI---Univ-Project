package of amendments to the common position which is acceptable to both colegislators and to the Commission .
Similarly , their application in practice is feasible .
For consumers , it means new means of protection in certain sectors , such as aggressive practices , and the certainty that cohesive rules apply throughout the European Union .
That is why we call on the Commission , the Member States and the social partners to pay particular attention to this issue and to include occupational risks for women among the indicators used for monitoring health and safety at work , by which we mean the relevant research and studies carried out , statistics and accident reports .
I therefore ask : First , is it or is it not our strategic choice that the European economy should become the most competitive economy in the world by 2010 ?
Commissioner , ultimately what we need to achieve is not double the resources , but our strategic objective and this begs the question as to whether double is enough to achieve our objective .     . – We express our undivided solidarity and support for the workers at the Thyssen Krupp steelworks in Terni in Italy , who are fighting for the right to work and for industrial steel production to be protected and against the anti-labour policy of the EU and of the company , which is expressed in terms of coercion and threats of further redundancies .
The right to work and satisfaction of contemporary grass-roots needs will be achieved through the working-class and grass-roots fight against the ΕU and its anti-labour policy .     . – The resolution by the Committee on Foreign Affairs expresses in its entirety the reactionary , aggressive and anti-grass roots foreign policy of the ΕU and its imperialist character .
On the contrary , it collectively condemns Iraqi and grass-roots resistance in general as terrorism .
The ΕU and the European monopolies are jointly responsible for the situation .
Universal problems are deliberately projected , so as to conceal the class character of the policies applied for the benefit of big business .
The Communist Party of Greece will vote against both resolutions .     – Mr President , the question of Lebanon is included in this week 's agenda .
Is there no sensitivity on that subject ?
If , therefore , we really want democracy and equality before the law , we should call on the Turkish army to leave Cyprus , just as we are calling on the Syrian army to leave Lebanon .     – Mr President , as one of the basic financing institutions of the European Union , I consider the importance of the role of the European Investment Bank in achieving the objectives of the Lisbon strategy to be self-evident .
Within these frameworks , I commend the effort of the European Investment Bank to guide the investments of the European Union on the basis of the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy .
I think it is important to extend loans to the social economy and local service sector as well as reducing high administrative costs .
To close , I should also like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Lipietz , for his excellent report .     – Mr President , given the important advantages of alternative forms of energy to the environment , public health and citizens ’ quality of life , the question to which neither the Commission nor the European Parliament has given an effective answer is : how can we promote the further development of alternative forms of energy , so that the citizens can enjoy their advantages ?
The first line of approach is to create a more beneficial political environment in which to promote alternative forms of energy .
In other words , we need to protect these markets from the shackles of an energy system built – together with its legal bases – at a time when alternative forms of energy were almost unheard of .
I await the Commission ’s response and – more importantly – the next steps with interest .     – Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to put the question of alternative forms of energy into the context of the Lisbon Strategy and the approach to climate change taken in the Kyoto protocol .
Without doubt , renewable sources of energy can contribute to a secure energy supply in Europe ; however , they can also contribute to the Lisbon Strategy via technological development , technology exports , job creation and environmental protection .
However , it is particularly important that we are debating them again today , 8 March , on International Women 's Day because , in this way , we all – men and women – have a greater realisation that these problems are centuries old and cut across the ages and remain unresolved and topical .
As European men and women , we have a heightened awareness of this global endeavour , because our historical experience convinces us that combating women 's problems and achieving real equality are necessary prerequisites to growth , the quality of democracy and peace .
Development aid and development cooperation must be evaluated and based on issues such as : First , safeguarding women 's rights as the core of human rights in a country .
Violence against women and inequality between men and women have not disappeared .
Unfortunately , the Lisbon strategy has proven so far to be inadequate in drastically tackling the deficits in the social sector in the Union .
Sustainable development and social justice make sense not only when the general indicator of the economy and of human prosperity increases , but when social cohesion also progresses .
The roadmap of the Lisbon strategy should be adjusted to the new circumstances
