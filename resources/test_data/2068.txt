This is a very important point and I am delighted that both rapporteurs saw fit to mention it .
A multi-speed Europe has become the order of the day .
It is the task of Parliament to stand up to the Council and to present it with its own vision .
If we are to acknowledge and comprehend these traditions , we will have to do more than register the differences purely as ethnic characteristics or as a list of discriminations .
Parliament has shelved the issue again , and has failed yet again to deal with these major problems .
Extending majority voting in the Council must lead to codecision rights for the European Parliament .
Allow me to leave you in no doubt as to how the vast majority of people in my country , Austria that is , feel about such a development .
Our demands must not be more conservative than those of the European Commission or of individual Member States .
We are also a community of values .
Work is now to begin at last , and the costly palaver is over .
However , all parties involved in the Stability Pact will need a great deal of stamina .
Instead of maintaining a protectorate for decades , more commitment should be given to establishing the nation state of Bosnia Herzegovina .
But there is a new government and attitudes towards the refugee situation , economic development and , in particular , Europe , have changed .
But leaving that aside , the fact remains that this Stability Pact is of course adversely affected by the heterogeneity of its States .
I would be interested to know how the President-in-Office of the Council views the sale by auction of UMTS licences .
I emphasised how important it still is today to nip things in the bud whenever human dignity and human rights are at stake .
There have certainly been many shortcomings as far as our more recent history is concerned , and we are more conscious of them these days .
All the people of Europe must play their part in this .
Another matter of special concern to me is the framing of a European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights , relating as it does to quite crucial issues pertaining to the protection and furtherance of fundamental and human rights , and to making them more coherent and effective .
In its turn , invalidity cover provides for a pension in the event of complete or partial inability to practise one ' s profession .
It is not the task of the European Union to define the nature and scope of the risk coverage concerning other biometric risks .
The arrangements for this vary from one Member State to another , and if we want these funds to be compatible throughout the European Community then we are going to have to produce common provisions .
( The President cut the speaker off )
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we are all in favour of securing future financing for pensions , having an equitable and stable inter-generation compact , and creating a workable , clearly defined three-pillar model that increases the individual ' s range of options and supports the mobility of employees .
The PPE Group has not taken the easy way out .
What I am saying is that we now have the perfect opportunity to extend the European social system further and to develop it further in a judicious manner .
Discussion is currently ongoing in all Member States as to how we can reform the pensions system .
People need time to make these provisions .
I am thinking mainly of such fundamental draft directives as those pertaining to " copyright in the information society " , "distance selling " , and "financial services " , where we have already been kept waiting for the common position for a very long time .
The exchange of information , the collation and processing of experiences , as well as the development of new , modern methods of improving access to languages and making it more efficient , is also one of this project ' s key areas of concern .
This illustrates that everyone has recognised that there is an urgent need to develop EU citizens ' knowledge of languages , and also to encourage them to learn new languages .
I welcome the compromise we have reached on the Community action programme " Youth " and the outcome of the conciliation procedure .
The fact that we secured social protection for the young participants from their home country , and sickness insurance cover in the host country was another coup , likewise the fact that age limits are to be kept flexible and not rigid .
The new " Youth " action programme is the way to further European integration .
Thank you very much and the best of luck !
This is also in the interests of those who have been hit by the punitive tariffs imposed by the United States .
The arrangements for EU banana producers are not as good as they might be .
I would of course be delighted if Mr Chichester ' s amendment , which I have also signed , were to be accepted , but I would like to tell Commissioner Fischler that even if this amendment is not accepted , Amendment No 5 , which was accepted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , will give him the remit of coming up with a workable compromise acceptable to the WTO .
Furthermore , with regard to the demand that the tariff quota administration system should not have an adverse effect on operators and producers already present on the market , I must say that if we have to modify the whole COM now , there can be no guarantee that things will stay exactly as
