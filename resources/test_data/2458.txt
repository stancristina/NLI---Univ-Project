There are already horizontal measures in place guaranteeing equal access for organic bananas from third countries and organic bananas from the Community .
The President has accepted Amendment No 5 , and out of respect for the authority of her position , I accept this decision .
Madam President , this amendment has been tabled under the Rules of Procedure and it should be voted on accordingly .
It has subsequently voted against or withdrawn its name from all the compromise amendments that it had signed , without informing us of this .
Mr President , Parliament has been dealing with the situation in and around Chechnya for some time .
On the other hand , we are determined not simply to stand by and watch whilst Russia violates one international convention after another in this war in Chechnya .
We wish to help both peoples and both peoples have the right to advance towards freedom and towards taking their proper place in the international community .
The Chinese are still refusing to enter into a constructive dialogue with His Holiness the Dalai Lama , and political repression is on the increase .
How did a Tibetan delegate put it ?
We owe a debt of gratitude to the USA for defeating two totalitarian regimes , for defeating national socialism and communism , and for establishing democracy and the rule of law throughout our continent .
The result was primarily an expression of the internal policy debate , and the newly elected President , Mr Chen Shui-bian , based his election campaign almost entirely on internal issues , and the high-profile , aggressive and provocative noises emerging from the People ' s Republic of China , from a variety of sources , had , if anything , the opposite of the desired effect .
This makes the behaviour of the People ' s Republic of China all the more worrying for us , as before , during and after the democratic elections in Taiwan the Republic did not cease to make in some cases totally unacceptable threats towards its little brother .
They work very conscientiously and we should be just as conscientious when it comes to voting ! ( Loud applause )
Mr President , I just wanted to ask why we are not voting on Ethiopia now .
The Commission text indicates that additional administrative options are to be created , so as to facilitate more precise selection of those goods for which export refunds are to be granted .
I am sure that you will be able to give us some answers in a moment .
You gave yoghurt as an example , and it is a good one , as it demonstrates how illogical a system can be .
The level of aid will remain the same , only the source of funding will change , and no one can seriously maintain that aid is only good if it comes totally from the Community budget .
Second , my thanks also to the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for supporting this important reform project .
Mr President , I will not actually speak for very long , but , so far , if I disregard the comments made by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten , only those in favour of the process have been allowed to speak .
Motions for resolutions ( B5-0345/2000 , B5-0348/2000 , B5-0360/2000 , B5-0392/2000 , B5-0395/2000 ) on the famine in Ethiopia
Commissioner , I am waiting for your master plan , your schedule , your specific measures for implementation .
Where are these 32 and more who stood up before and who will stand up again , but who now , when we are discussing matters , are no longer here ?
However , you have not set any deadline for this .
It was offered on a voluntary basis in an exemplary manner .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is now some three months since Hurricane Lothar caused devastating damage to forests in Europe , and in particular France and Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg .
During his visit to the Black Forest on 16 February , the Commissioner for Agriculture , Rural Development and Fisheries , Dr Fischler , indicated broad flexibility within the existing financial framework for measures for rural development .
For me also the timber trade is something of great importance , but then our aid to Ethiopia is equally important .
They are no less valid because only a few delegates participated .
On 16 December last year , at the time of the decision on the 2000 budget , the budgetary authority once again called upon the Commission to submit a multiannual financial plan for a programme of assistance for the Western Balkans and , if necessary , depending on the amount required , to submit concurrently a proposal on the review of the financial perspective .
It therefore proposed and decided to reprogramme the budget for external actions , as I will describe in more detail in a moment .
In connection with the 2000 Budget , you proposed that , in future , the appropriations allocated for Cyprus and Malta should no longer appear under the external action heading but be reclassified under the pre-accession aid budget , so as to make it clear that we have a coherent plan here ; that these are appropriations that will be spent with a view to the desired accession of Cyprus and Malta to the European Union .
We had an opportunity to go into this in depth during the 2000 budget discussions .
I think we must not give the impression that we can keep using the agriculture budget as a kind of bottomless pit whenever we are short of money in other areas .
Regarding your question of when the documents will be available , you will find them on the Internet tomorrow morning
