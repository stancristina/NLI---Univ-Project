It is a pleasure and a joy to see our fellow Member Baroness Ludford back at work .
We are greatly looking forward to seeing Baroness Ludford welcome with open arms the several thousand refugees from Sangatte who are hoping to settle in England .
The European Parliament ' s reaction may not be fully appropriate , but it has been triggered by a genuine reason .
The numbers of those returning will be limited , we must have the courage to say this , but a State of Israel is a State of Israel , a Palestinian State is a Palestinian State and the two must remain separate .
As one speaker said today , there is an elected president - Mr Arafat .
This is not true ; there is always another solution .
I am thinking of the courageous statements made by Mr Avraham Burg , Speaker of the Knesset , who believes that a nation of occupants will end up being disfigured by the crimes of occupation .
Mr Barak made some proposals with which we are all familiar and these proposals were not accepted .
The State of Israel now possesses three quarters of Palestine ' s former territory under the British mandate .
We can only encourage you to pursue all initiatives for cooperation between the United Nations , the United States and the most directly involved Arab States , in order to put forward proposals , in conjunction with them , on actions that are crucial to restoring mutual trust and respect , without which the current downward spiral of violence can never be halted .
Simply by complying with international law , by ending the repressive occupation of Palestine and by withdrawing behind Israel ' s internationally recognised borders .
Our objective is food safety .
Instead of giving the Commission and the Veterinary Office greater powers , it would be better to harmonise the measures that need to be taken and then implement them effectively .
This step is essential to finding a way out of a crisis that is still unfolding .
The other countries affected have a lower rate of prevalence and also appear to be in control of the situation .
In a world in which everything is going faster and faster and in which speed of movement has become a factor in the generation of wealth , there are increasing numbers of men and women for whom the doors to work , to culture and to knowledge are closed .
The first idea concerns the involvement of citizens in the debate on the future of Europe .
So we have to combine the two .
It was a short two - or three-month solution to a very important point in terms of the powers of Parliament .
The consultation of Parliament is therefore utterly illusory ; it is worthless and I would even go as far as to say that it is insulting .
The requirement of 'dual criminality ' - under which the person accused can only be surrendered if the facts that motivated the issuing of an arrest warrant also constitute a crime in the Member State where the arrest warrant is to be executed - is abolished for 32 offences that are punishable by a term of at least three years ' imprisonment in the Member State which issued the arrest warrant .
Regarding the arrest warrant , it has been repeatedly reiterated , most notably in Article 1 , that in the execution of a European arrest warrant , the Member States and judicial authorities must always ensure that they scrupulously observe the principles recognised by Article 6 of the Treaty and that are reflected in the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights .
People have accused European legal affairs of lagging behind for years .
I do not know if the draft consensus for Monterrey , which does not propose any ambitious objectives , any practical financial measures or a timetable , is set in stone .
However , the essential guarantees that we requested in our explanation of vote of 29 November 2001 have still not been included , such as the right for the judge of the executing country to properly check the validity of the request and for the new system not to apply to the nationals of the executing country as they should continue to enjoy maximum protection .
When will they stop pulling the wool over their own eyes , and over the eyes of the citizens at the same time ?
The zero tolerance principle must always prevail in any matter regarding the protection of public health .
Mr Napolitano , the rapporteur , is proposing a number of specific measures which have been approved by the Group of the Party of European Socialists and which could , in my view , easily receive the unanimous approval of the Convention .
European integration must involve the people and not the institutions .
Mr Napolitano , I would like to thank you and congratulate you on behalf of the Commission .
First of all , it must not bring their legitimacies into conflict , as universal suffrage runs through European integration in several ways ; in a direct way for this House and in an indirect way for the Council and the European Council .
The European decision-making process is already sufficiently complicated , not to mention , of course , the risks of institutional conflicts that might arise between the third chamber and this House , with which the Commission has , for many years , shared and defended a certain vision and ambition for the Community model .
I cannot conclude without giving my thoughts on paragraph 12 of the report .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would firstly like to thank Mr Pohjamo for his excellent report , for the interest he always shows , as
