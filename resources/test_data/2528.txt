Balkans will at the same time undertake to readmit citizens of third countries who have passed through them illegally on their way to the EU.
The Commission has already put forward proposals for talks both on visa flexibility agreements and readmission agreements with Macedonia , in the former Republic of Yugoslavia .
These mandates for negotiation are now being discussed by the Council at working group level .
Proposals for mandates for other countries in the Western Balkans are expected to come from the Commission in July .
We hope that the first agreements will be in place as early as this year .
This is a very important issue for us .
Visa flexibility is a very real issue that affects ordinary people and which can strengthen rapprochement with the European Union in the countries of the Western Balkans .
It is also a way of lending support to the stability and development of this region , and it is therefore important that progress be made in this area .
We will , however , push energetically forward with this issue .     .
Parliament’s supervisory powers hitherto in the comitology procedure have been virtually a farce .
The case began on an initiative by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , when the Commission , exceeding its powers , had granted an exemption regarding the banned fire retardant Deca-BDE.
This Deca-BDE case was rectified at the end of June , when the Commission actually reversed its decision , which means that this hazardous substance will be removed from electronic equipment .
I am glad about that .     Firstly , I would like to praise this proposal for its timeliness .
Freedom of expression is an important issue .
We need to be especially concerned about children and young people , who are our society’s most valuable asset .
That is worth remembering at a time when the main theme in society often seems to be worthlessness .     .
Carbon dioxide emissions from traffic have increased by almost a third since 1990 .
This completely wipes out the effect of a large proportion of the reductions in emissions in other sectors .
The European automotive industry is not going to achieve the emissions reductions for cars it promises by 2008 .
Taxation on vehicles in Member States varies widely .
In Finland , on the other hand , car tax actually punishes those who buy vehicles that produce fewer emissions .
It must also take account of emissions other than carbon dioxide .
Furthermore , the tax should also apply to SUVs , that is to say , N1 vehicles .
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance also believes that this should be possible .
The present situation , in which the car is one of the most difficult objects to move inside the Union , is intolerable .
For example , in Finland , a country where distances are long and the population is sparse , a passenger car is not exactly a luxury , but a necessity for working people and their families .
Car taxation should also move towards a system of tax concessions for equipment that increases safety on the roads .
Obviously , it is not worth talking about car tax unless you include fuel taxes .
Besides , the latest research shows that carbon dioxide emissions from diesel engines are lower than those from petrol cars .
That is what we need .     This is an important debate , and it is important that we demonstrate solidarity with the citizens of countries that have become the victims of forest fires , especially the Spanish .
When the wind blew from the east , large clouds of smoke came across into Finland .
Russia must comply with international agreements , and Parliament should call on the Commission to take action and negotiate with Russia to ensure that it too adheres to these agreements , provides its neighbouring countries with sufficient information , is prepared to accept help and also takes adequate action itself .
It so happened that when Finland’s Prime Minister offered Russia help , the latter did not even agree to accept it .
I contacted the Sittings Secretariat at approximately 11.15 this morning .
Of course I understand that I cannot use my speaking time now , but I really regret that the Sittings Secretariat informed Members so late that the debate would continue and not end at 11.30 , as it was supposed to .
I also thank you , too , Mr President , for your kind words of introduction .
Your powers of influence are considerable : you have a chance effectively to promote the aims of the entire Union in your day-to-day work .
The Finnish Presidency wants to work very closely with the European Parliament .
The importance of European cooperation and integration to promote peace , stability and prosperity in our continent is obvious , and the results are striking .
Each Member State must implement these values in its own way , but together we often achieve better results .
The EU is a visible and important actor in matters ranging from development to crisis management .
That is why we try to promote multilateralism and reach international agreements to combat the threats and dangers that are common to all of us .
International crime is a great concern to us all .
If there is to be security on a broad scale and if it is to be endorsed globally , it needs to be linked to human rights and development .
It is one of the strengths of the Union that it has at its disposal a wide range of resources , from humanitarian aid to its policies on agriculture , trade , development and the environment .
