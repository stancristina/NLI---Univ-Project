We shall certainly strive in order to do that and I think that the effect over the next few years will start to become apparent .
One of our difficulties is always going to be of course that the better we are at reform , the less anybody is going to know about it so we will be relying on our friends and partners in the European Parliament to explain with their customary generosity the full efforts being made by the Commission to properly serve the people of Europe .
I know I can rely on everyone here .
As we sit here , hundreds of thousands of people are in enormous peril from the floods in Mozambique .
This has not just happened .
The flooding has been going for weeks , and yet only now it seems there is an assessment of need .
The level of practical assistance from the Community and from the Member States has been pathetic .
For a long time , many of us have sounded a warning that the European Union was spending too much time on its potentially damaging and essentially political project of establishing military decision-making structures , when instead it should have been concentrating its efforts on the improvement of its civil instruments , particularly for humanitarian intervention .
I acknowledge Mr Patten' s efforts in this direction , but what a pity that the governments of the Member States had not devoted as much time to sorting out their capacity for disaster relief and humanitarian assistance as they have in the dangerous business of creating military structures that will ultimately duplicate and undermine those of NATO .
Of course , there is a relationship between military resources and humanitarian assistance , and there are serious military deficiencies in the armed forces of many European countries .
These are of long standing , but are being addressed already within NATO .
I have not yet heard a convincing security-policy explanation of why the European Union needs to establish autonomous , decision-making capabilities for the use of military forces outside of the NATO structures unless it is to create bodies which will rival NATO .
After all , the EU Member States are either full members of NATO or sit around the Euro Atlantic Partnership Council table .
NATO is largely European .
Finally , Mr Solana , I would just like to ask you what point there is in having the much heralded policy planning and early warning cell in the Council Secretariat if still we are taken by surprise by yet another humanitarian catastrophe .
Mr President , I seem to recall from my study of European history , that the 1809 Convention of Sintra was a controversial peace agreement which probably lengthened rather than shortened the Napoleonic wars and nearly cost the Duke of Wellington his job .
I hope this is not an omen for this Sintra Agreement .
That said , I would like to congratulate the high representative on the progress that has been made so far .
But it has to be admitted that much of what he said is the progress in institutional matters , and the real test of the European defence identity will be in its ability to produce capability and capacity , rather than nicely formulated institutions .
And , to that end , I am not clear as to the extent to which we have progressed on developing heavy lift capacity to be able to get these 60 000 troops into operation , or what progress we have made on autonomous intelligence capacity , particularly given the American statements that they are not giving intelligence to Europeans until they can deal with security .
We have all heard some of the tales emanating from the Council of Ministers building in Brussels .
To what extent are we going to get some form of convergence on defence expenditure , because some Member States spend considerably more than others .
And indeed , some Member States are not geared for mobility .
They are very static in their military forces , and unsuitable for this sort of warfare .
Can I perhaps also turn to Mr Patten as well and ask , in terms of the conflict prevention work we are going to be doing , to what extent will it be possible for us to look at long-term conflict-causing situations such as environmental degradation and shortage of water and then incorporate them into mainstream EU policies , particularly in development , because there is no point trying to rapidly respond to something we have had years to put right .
And finally , can I also endorse Mrs Schroedter ' s comments that we do need to have a Parliamentary dimension in this defence development .
We cannot leave it simply to governments .
I would also like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their statements and I agree with the Commissioner ' s statement ; it is time that fine words were translated into action .
We all know to what extent women are under-represented in decision making at all levels because we have the statistics and they speak for themselves .
I agree that accurate statistics too are essential because it is only when we see the figures changing that we will know we are beginning to overcome the problems .
It is systematic monitoring which will reveal this .
Mainstreaming is a long-term commitment and process .
In the meantime , we need positive action and this means the use of quotas and other measures .
We can learn from the successes mentioned , not only by looking at the actual numbers of women that were elected , but the effect that has had on the nature of government to illustrate that everyone benefits from a truly representative system .
I am pleased to say that in Wales , which I represent , 40 % of
