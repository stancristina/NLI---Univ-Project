recognise that the European Union has an interest in the stability of this country in the heart of Africa .
Above all , however , we need a convincing plan , a plan that is able to convince any troublemakers that it is better to accept the results of the election , and also to encourage the citizens of Congo to exercise their right to vote .
Ladies and gentlemen , a fine gesture by Mr Chirac cannot conceal the issues that have still not been addressed , that is to say how is dispatching 1 500 soldiers to Kinshasa going to guarantee free elections throughout Congo ?
The military is making it increasingly clear that it is not in favour of this deployment .
In my first statement I said that very clear comments had been made by the President and the two Vice-Presidents , and I might perhaps quote just one paragraph from the press release issued following Monday’s Defence Council : ‘During its meeting held on Monday 20 March , chaired by the Head of State , his Excellency Mr Joseph Kabila’ .
The reason for this is clear : we did not want to reward the inefficiency implied in the non-implementation of appropriations .
There is one more point that I need to comment on , since you raised it , Mrs Kinnock , and that is how the overseas countries and territories and administration costs are to be dealt with .
This would represent a backward step in all our efforts to improve coordination of EU development aid .
I am also very happy that it will be a unanimous resolution , because of course that would give a great deal of support for the positions that various Members of this House have expressed here today .
The Council has fully adhered to the practice adopted up to now and has included Romania and Bulgaria , which will have acceded by then , in its calculations for the appropriations for the tenth EDF in 2008 .
The Morgantini report calls for basic provision with drinking water , education and other key public services to be excluded from liberalisation from the outset .
It is after all their own money and the EU funding regulations should not place disproportionate restrictions on the parties .
Our young people represent our future .
We want sustainable long-term planning of party funding ; we do not want a situation in which , in the run-up to Christmas , so to speak , money is splashed about because of the pressure to ‘use it or lose it’ .
If I may return to Mr Lehne’s remarks , I do not regard that as an ‘abstract concept’ but as a new political departure .
None of us has said here that a party statute alone would make political parties adopt the right course of action .
Let me say in conclusion that I am fully in favour of European electoral lists to supplement national lists , because a European list will serve to encourage European parties to campaign under a high-profile European leader .
There is even something of a debate on whether the work we are considering here could ultimately lead to a uniform European code of civil law .
Firstly , the Commission should keep Parliament constantly and comprehensively informed of progress in the formulation of the frame of reference and the improvement of the body of Community law and practice relating to consumer protection , and we should have the opportunity to pronounce ourselves at any time within a continuous process .
In the days and weeks to come , the Council will carefully consider what specific measures can and should be taken to express our discontent with this situation , and also to influence future developments in the country .
That is the truth of the matter .
That is exactly what we need now .
We shall endeavour to do that .     .
One of the main problems is that most mothers from the days when mothers could not have or did not want careers because of bringing up and caring for their children are at a clear disadvantage , first in their careers and subsequently in old age .
We need a different kind of debate , as we cannot just see children as an investment to safeguard labour and pension provision .
The use of renewable raw materials and renewable energy production both represent an enormous potential for European rural areas .
If we wish to use recovery , therefore , it is important to recover straw , wood or hedges , but tying up land for renewable raw materials that we need for food is a major problem that calls for less enthusiasm and more precision .     – Mr President , there is no doubt that biomass belongs to the future of European energy supply .
We now have 10 party families , which shows the variety of our political culture .
We are rightly making policy in other continents , we are taking responsibility for peace and freedom , but we are not managing to provide the instruments that are needed .
I would just like to move that we should either slot it in at 3 p.m. on Thursday or begin earlier on Thursday , or else we will have even more problems with the voting on the two reports scheduled for that day , in that we will again be in the same situation of having to defer the vote , and all the rest of it , so we can either begin earlier on Thursday , or deal with this at 3 p.m. in order to have a proper vote on both reports .     – Mr President , according to the original title , we were to have been debating the Assyrian community in Iraq , but then the Conference of Presidents changed the title to ‘the prisoners in Iraq’ .
