to vote for referral back to committee , in accordance with Rule 144 of the Rules of Procedure .
Objectives such as these will be difficult to meet if we retain , on the same issue , a spread of provisions , many of which are substantially amended .

The document concerned is clear and forms part of a range of measures that seeks to avoid the creation of any technical barriers to the trade in motor vehicles between the Contracting Parties .
Mr Berenguer Fuster’s report calls for the approval of the proposal for a Council decision on a draft regulation of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe .
In this particular case , it is hoped that a new regulation will be approved on uniform requirements concerning the type approval of tyres with respect to tyre rolling noise .
This proposal suggests that the dispatch or exportation of the products concerned should be authorised after the economic advantage has been reimbursed .
In view of the importance of the European Audiovisual Observatory and the laudable work it has been doing , I welcome the rapporteur’s proposal to accept the Commission ’s proposal to extend the Community’s participation in the Observatory by two years , whilst retaining the current budget ceiling .
This deserves my support .
Indeed , tobacco consumption represents significant public health risks .
Whilst the report received a favourable opinion from the committees involved and the adoption of the World Health Organisation Framework Convention would not have serious financial implications and would not affect existing legal acts , I continue to have the reservations expressed during the parliamentary process , particularly as regards ensuring compliance with the subsidiarity principle .
Without this objective , I feel that Europe would become ‘funnelled’ , a victim of the gravitational movement towards a centre that is divorced from local realities .
In light of the crisis in the coal and steel sector and the social and economic costs of the restructuring that has taken place over recent decades , the liquidation of the ECSC – irrespective of criticisms that one might level at it – has left a void that must be filled , also at Community level , which the new Research Fund for Coal and Steel does not fill .
We should also like to join the rapporteur in praising , once again , all those who set up and developed the European Coal and Steel Community , and who thus made a significant contribution towards the unification of Europe .     .
We hold the Commission and the Member States responsible for allowing this crucial sector to be dismantled and thousands of workers to be made redundant .
Such actions are designed to promote the dissemination of practices , develop innovation and demonstrate how skills and experience can be used elsewhere ; they also help to enforce Community policy and legislation in the area of the environment .
Following on from previous positions , Parliament has not agreed to conclude the Agreement with the USA on transferring air passenger data within the framework of the so-called ‘war on terror’ .
In view of the fact that this consultation was approved , this report has yet to be voted on .
Because I disagree entirely , from both a political and a technical point of view , with any recommendation to the Council not to conclude this Agreement with the USA , I voted against consulting the Court of Justice , which I see as a disgraceful delaying tactic and a new hurdle in the way of an Agreement that is necessary to our security and freedom .     .
This will be a step towards tightening control of the external borders and enhancing mutual trust between Member States in the area of border control .
Consequently , and in view of enlargement , we accepted Mrs Angelilli’s position that this should be a first step towards ultimately harmonising procedures , such as stamping the travel documents of third-country citizens as they leave the ‘Schengen area’ .     .
The Common Manual of External Borders provides for the stamping of travel documents and the relaxation of land border controls in exceptional circumstances , due mainly to the intensity of traffic implied by such circumstances .
The intention is that the Monitoring Centre should not simply collect data but should also evaluate national policies and strategies and assess trends in drug consumption .
Nevertheless , it has become clear that the many amendments that have been tabled and which are scattered throughout this report , detract from this fundamental aim .
The discharge process for 2002 has been marked by the Eurostat case and by the ongoing Commission reform .
The Eurostat case also highlights the need to review the accountability chain in the Commission and the relationships that exist between the various key players and the Commissioners .
Furthermore , this will enable a more reliable comparison to be made with the EU’s own financial perspective .
In fact , it was even rejected recently by the Council .
I voted against the van Hulten report because the rapporteur has taken the opportunity presented by the assessment of the implementation of Parliament’s accounts to proffer , out of context , his own political opinions on the system of payments to Members of Parliament and on the location of Parliament’s seats .
We are consequently unhappy that , instead of focusing on the issue of relations between shareholders and managers – between ownership and control – the Commission has not attached greater importance to effective protection for workers , to their participation and that of the organisations that represent them in the process of taking decisions on the lives of their companies .
