particularly when comparing framework conditions , because tradition and culture are also reflected .
Finally , Mr President , I am a bit sceptical about taking up methods development at a political level .
Developments in industry and research have actually overtaken us politicians .
It is therefore natural that there are demands like this on the part of consumers .
We still do not know what is equivalent to ordinary food .
On the other hand , I would also like to pick up on a little of what Mr Gillis talked about , namely that we have in fact worked on modifying the genes in crop plants and domestic animals since we left the hunter-gatherer stage around 10 , 000 years ago .
We have always looked for strange plants which could be better than those we have .
No, instead it is by some kind of strange chance that we grow maize ; it should not really have existed , but even nature is very strange sometimes .
But we are not doing that .
However , I am not so sure that deregulation is the best way to do that .
It should be about us exploring what space has to give and nothing else .
Several reports from Parliament in the past have said that this is dangerous on safety grounds .
Fourthly , we must do much more research on solar energy than we have done so far .
In fact I believe this is the only possible solution given the pressure of time under which we have to work .
That is of course not something which Mr Fayot can control .
Firstly , with the euro , crises and disturbances in the economy are going to spread more rapidly on the capital markets , and Europe risks having an Asian situation .
Secondly , democracy is being eroded .
Thirdly , this debate shows a massive conformity of views .
We know that when markets for all goods grow , especially for food - that is , when food is transported further and further away from the place of production ( one of the ideas of the EU and a free market economy is that this should be possible ) - something else also happens .
If we do not do that , we take the risk that consumers will not get sufficient information .
It concerns two paragraphs with essentially the same content , in which the Commission wants to establish that 'to avoid creating new barriers to free movement , Member States should refrain from adopting more detailed rules . '
But in the Lannoye report something has been drafted which begins to resemble an environmental and health guarantee - that is , a right ( not just a possibility ) for individual Member States to take a lead in tightening rules aimed at protecting health , the environment and consumer interests .
I therefore hope Parliament adopts this report and that it also has an effect on the EU 's official policy .
When does the Commissioner think this recommendation is going to be adopted by the Council , and how did the discussion go at the Council 's meeting in November when , according to reports , this question was discussed ?
Let me start like everyone else by wishing everyone a happy New Year and thanking the Commissioner for his reply .
That means , Commissioner de Silguy , that if we have a requirement for a nominal budget balance and the countries have a national debt , and we assume that we have inflation which is nominally at 1 %-3 % , the requirements of the stability pact will lead to a real squeeze on demand .
I shall do no less than everyone else and also wish everyone a happy New Year , not least the Commissioner .
We all have an exciting year ahead of us , now that we are going to launch the euro , and the Commissioner is going to be very much involved in that .
That means , if I understand correctly , that there are no formal discussions about majority decisions and such .
I also join in the goodwill wishes for the New Year expressed by previous speakers .
Are there any thoughts about how the few countries which remain outside EMU, when it is implemented , are going to be kept informed ?
It is a fallacy to believe that you can conduct an independent monetary policy outside .
One of the reasons for this is that at the same time as EMU is to be implemented our unemployment is much too high .
But the balance between growth targets and price stability targets should be better .
Employment has not been mentioned at all , while growth has been mentioned .
The question which then also arose was the lack of democracy when we were not really sure who is in charge of the ECB.
I also believe that through currency stability the euro is good for growth and employment in the EU , particularly in the euro countries .
I have never before received an answer which is so definite about the timing as that it will be done in 1999 .
I am therefore grateful for the reply .
Now I have got this answer about the year 1999 .
We do not have a difference of opinion .
The EU now has access to the legal framework and the possibility of using economic pressure .
Thank you for your reply .
I wonder whether I would have an answer to that question .
We have now had another reminder of the Columbian Government 's duplicity through its arming and use of these paramilitary groups .
Mr President , I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for , as usual , a well drawnup and very good report .
