serious discussion about a citizens ' Europe or citizens ' participation under such conditions ?
Such terms as partnership , decentralization , dialogue with the citizens , and communication without propagandist undertones took on a new meaning .
And from within this general framework has come the report we are debating today , after so much delay .
The approximately ECU 100 million a year represents little more than the budget of an average European company which normally advertises a single product .
We need even better cooperation with the Commission and even better coordination .
The main thing , I think , is that we must not be discouraged by the difficulties , and we must persevere .
Recital G begins : ' Inquiet du non respect par Israël des engagements ...
Madam President , our draft resolution asks for a very small number of reasonable things from Slovakia : an assessment , and the promise that the findings of that assessment will be respected .
We know very well that it is a pan-European matter and , I would venture to say , a global matter .
The assault on the president of the Turkish Association of Human Rights , Akin Birdal , is the product of an unwholesome political climate which favours and breeds violence , and the activity of the para-state against the democratic and human rights of the Turkish people .
The European Parliament must take urgent action and force the Turkish government to respect the rights of the Turkish people and to abide by its obligations , which arise both from the customs union and from its other international commitments .
Human rights are not simply an internal matter for a state .
Turkey 's establishment cannot tolerate discontent , protest or a different outlook .
It is defended through reasoning .
Relations between the European Parliament and questions of foreign policy : there is no interpretation , Parliament 's opinion is sought neither by the Council nor the Commission , decisions are not taken at a cross-institutional level which would make the demands of the Treaties binding .
There is no coordination in arms exports .
( The president cut off the speaker )
This division by the European Commission is wholly unacceptable .
Not only does it heartily accept the findings , conclusions and guidelines of the European Commission ; on several points it even outshines the Commission by demanding yet tougher measures to the detriment of the workforce and to the benefit of private-sector profitability .
We support the plight of the workers , which is taking on ever-increasing dimensions , and we shall continue to do so .
The second step will be the vote on this report , which really sets out the basis for an integrated policy which will create equal conditions for competition and development in both continental and island regions .
Also , when drafting regulations and directives account needs to be taken of the unique nature of the island regions and the opinions of local bodies .
In addition , we need to examine the environmental impact of activities in neighbouring areas , such as the polluting industries on the Turkish coasts and plans to construct a nuclear factory in Akouyiou , as these will have a horrendous impact on the environment of the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean as a whole .
And finally , we need to introduce codes of conduct and environmental and cultural rules for tourist enterprises .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to congratulate the three rapporteurs , Mr Klaß , Mr Arias Cañete and Mr Viola on their reports .
These provisions could form the basis for the application of an integrated policy for the islands .
Firstly , we need to include a new sub-programme in the Interreg Community initiative devoted entirely to island regions and to further promote trans-island cooperation .
And finally , we need priority cofinancing from the Commission to buy emergency means of transport to provide fast links between islands and other islands or mainland areas in the event of an emergency .
From this viewpoint , we feel that the agreements with Russia and Canada , while they do not provide the ideal solution , nevertheless give a positive thrust to the matter by prohibiting leghold traps and any other methods of hunting which are unnecessarily cruel .
However , there is another aspect that I wish to talk about : sensitivity towards animals is justified but there must also be sensitivity towards native peoples .
Thousands of people earn a living from treating and trading in fur .
As a result , we cannot ignore such vital aspects of the matter .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , listening to my colleague from the Socialist Group , Mr Wynn , I have to tell you that I too am a member of the Committee on Budgetary Control of the European Parliament and , naturally , not all the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control share the views that were expressed by Mr Wynn .
I wonder whether , if you had rejected them all , that would have been a mark of respect or derision for the European Parliament .
Secondly , could you tell us whether the tobacco that is imported into Europe is of better quality than the tobacco that is produced in Europe ?
But what I have not heard from the Commission today is how much money you will give to teach our children in school that they must not smoke .
If the Community really wanted to reduce or to put an end to smoking , it should not implement an anti-smoking policy but should , within the context of an anti-smoking policy , reduce and even ban tobacco imports .
The previous regime brought about a significant reduction in real average prices for the producer and a corresponding reduction in his income .
