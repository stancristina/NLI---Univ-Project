Padania is liable to Italy for its taxes as well .
The Archbishop of Milan , Monsignor Carlo Maria Martini , is calling upon all politicians , in particular those like you and me , President Prodi , for whom the cultural and historic principle behind their presence in politics is the principle of the active involvement of Catholics in politics , to reconsider a development process , which , in addition to economic profit , takes the marginalised and those left behind by society very much into account .
Our heritage has taught us that politics must have a heart .
These goals will be more easily obtainable only if the Intergovernmental Conference , which will draw to a close within the year , results in constitutional reform , providing the Commission with real and adequate powers so that it will no longer merely implement Council decisions or Parliament ' s codecisions but will have to perform the role of a real European government .
Firstly , the promotion of and participation in the drafting of joint plans for the creation of an integrated services network in the transport and energy sectors , with the backing of the European Investment Bank .
( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for this strong , serious and constructive debate .
It has been a calm debate with broad agreement over the basic points , but also where there has been a marked reassertion of Parliament ' s rights and of the need for cooperation and dialogue between Parliament , the Commission and the Council .
These are the contradictions that it is our duty to rectify and overcome .
The Commission wants globalisation .
This still does not go far enough towards controlling globalisation , or at least understanding the consequences of globalisation , but it is a substantial and necessary response .
The synergies between the Commission , Parliament and the Council are essential , Mr Cox .
Well , we have presented - and in January this House supported these hypotheses with an overwhelming majority - a programme for reform which will allow the Commission to concentrate on the fight against the most serious and important breaches of competition policy at European level , and we have begun a process of major cooperation with the national authorities on this .
I welcome this broad unity over enlargement .
We did this , mindful of the serious problems for the local economies , but we explained that these are Europe ' s rules and that this is a safety measure which everyone has to and will have to adopt .
I would remind you of the long journey the American President made in recent years which brought hope for a time , but then nothing came of it .
I have also been rebuked for not having mentioned certain important sectors such as fisheries .
So while the term "manifesto " might sound negative , it does , nevertheless , have an important value of its own and a sound political content .
You said that the honeymoon is over .
It was a real five-year programme of the Community of Siena ; it was their document whereby they tried to describe the society of the time .
Mr President , I voted for the Decourri√®re report on the Community initiative INTERREG , mainly because of the reply Commissioner Barnier gave to some Members who took the floor and asked for this programme to make greater reference to border regions with maritime frontiers .
I voted for it , not just because I was born in a coastal town , Genoa , but above all because the frontiers of regions bordered by the sea are frontiers too .
Mr President , it is difficult to summarise the areas covered by such a large and complex directive .
As regards eliminating the pollution generated by dangerous substances in the aquatic environment , an optimum approach should provide a regulation at both national and Community levels , which enables clearer identification of the various classes of bodies of water polluted as a result of human production activities .
Following the working meeting of 1 February , which Commissioner Barnier referred to and which benefited from the weighty contribution of the Commission , the committee intends to take stock of developments at the Intergovernmental Conference at all of its meetings .
As you know , there are problems which not only concern this House but also the European officials who are also European citizens .
Like a number of previous speakers , I , too , wish to consider the economic problem and the problem of finding funding for projects , which , in my view , should be incorporated into the pubic domain .
I would therefore ask Parliament and the Commission to give the matter their full attention .
With the Maastricht Treaty and the single currency , budgetary discipline became tighter and recourse to devaluation ceased as a means of endeavouring to restore marginal competitiveness .
That is something we would do well to recognise .
I also abstained for another reason .
I trust that this will be remedied in the future .
.
The second concerns the management of welfare systems and those who operate them .
It is , after all , a matter of civilisation , progress and common dignity for the present European Union and a future enlarged community .
In that sense , we need to be able to export a culture based on legality and respect for the law .
By that I mean the use , and often abuse , of embargoes during recent years , and the over-cautious application of the clause allowing suspension of the agreements between the European Union and third countries , where there have been human rights violations .
In particular , we should be updating the areas where human rights need to be safeguarded .
