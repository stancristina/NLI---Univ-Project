for doing this , as does the use of less harmful materials in the construction of infrastructure .
One of two things could be at work here .
Not only Parliament , but also our own ministers competent in all the different fields are at risk of falling victim to the undisguised takeover attempt on the part of the Finance Ministers .
In the past , the IGC has not managed to establish efficient , transparent and democratic structures , and at this rate , if the results of the Convention are now being brushed aside , we are at risk of ending up in a debate that is altogether different .
The Committee of the Regions is not the answer to the regions ’ laments .
I also welcome the newspaper report to the effect that the Council has agreed to Commissioner Patten’s proposal to set down in writing an unambiguous policy for the EU’s relations with the Russian Federation .
Putin and his cronies will therefore need to abandon the traditional attitude of wanting to operate both within and outside of the partnership .
What strikes me in particular , is that you have specifically mentioned Moldova , and the timeframe for the withdrawal of the troops .
I have to say that I find the Commissioner’s approach very clear .
What is important now is to formulate policy for relations with our new neighbours for the next couple of years , and one thing should be paramount in this .
It is understandable that countries such as Moldavia and the Ukraine should ask why the Commission ’s plans avoid the issue of their possible EU membership .
If both our new eastern and southern neighbours can make progress in the field of economic development , security and human rights , this will ultimately be to our benefit .
It should , by now , be apparent to everyone that Turkey’s chances of meeting the accession criteria next year are as good as non-existent .
It is also becoming increasingly clear , sadly , that a process has been started in which the international community , once hailed as a liberator , is increasingly being regarded as an occupier .
My second point is about Serbia and Montenegro .
There are many of those areas , both in Montenegro and in Serbia , that need funding , irrespective of whether those countries become independent or carry on together .
In conclusion , the final topic .
Accordingly , my message to you is that you will need to discontinue those bilateral agreements in a few years ’ time .
What should matter to us is to strike the right balance between , on the one hand , our criticism of the United States and of those agreements , and , on the other , recognition that we also want to bring those countries closer to Europe in the next couple of years .
This is certainly not insignificant from an electoral viewpoint .
First of all , in paragraph 10 , does the rapporteur not turn matters on their head in connection with the present visa regime between the European Union and the so-called SAP countries ?
That is by the by .
It is regrettable that we have missed the opportunity of communitising authorisations policy .
Even if employment and economy are allowed to take precedence over everything else , there are better ways to spend our tax revenues .     .
I also support his call for a speedy settlement of the permanent status of Kosovo on the basis of far-reaching autonomy or independence .
I quote : ‘The European Parliament ... considers that there is a need to introduce measures for administrative adjustment , structuring and staff training , aimed at the effective operation of the external offices and the network of information centres ... , which could also be used by MEPs in their respective constituencies’ .
It is only after a long , hopeless war of secession that a government has emerged ready to talk seriously with the Tamil resistance movement , which wants its own State .
These peoples can only be protected by a large degree of self-government or by secession .
In East Timor , we saw the devastating consequences of this kind of policy on the part of a previous president .
Against this depressing background , I ask that both Commission and Council show their ability to act .
The man on the street wonders why he should support a new treaty if it is uncertain that it will be observed .
The Constitution offers us more democracy and enables us to achieve more concrete results in areas that matter in Europe .
The public want to see results , and we can obtain those results with the new Constitution .
Such an historic reunification should not founder because Heads of Government behave in a wholly unacceptable manner , throwing their weight around and refusing to accept an adult outcome . : either you agree to the present proposal as Heads of Government or you are opposed to it .
In my country at least , many people are asking these questions .
He notes that we have reached a critical moment in time .
As the Guardian of the Treaty , the Commission has no choice but to follow the route it has now proposed .     . – The Queen of the Councils of Ministers , the Ecofin , has come tumbling off her pedestal with a loud thud .
As such , they carry a heavy responsibility .     . – Mr President , Commissioner , Europe must do better on behalf of its citizens .
In 2001 , we issued the White Paper on European Governance , on which we in this House gave our opinion .
I have , in this report , made various proposals to this effect
