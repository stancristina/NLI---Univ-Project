at national level .
I congratulate the Greek Presidency on the progress it has made in the field of justice and home affairs , and on the results achieved at the Thessaloniki European Council .
Finally , as a result of the Council 's decision , I hope that the European Parliament will be granted powers of codecision on asylum and immigration issues .
This report emphasises the need to make systematic use of gender budgeting , with a view to incorporating the gender perspective into Community and national budgetary procedures .
This will allow the development and dissemination of good methods and practices .
By voting in favour of this report , we are also underlining the importance of implementing the Beijing Action Platform and of drawing up provisions in the European Union 's own budget with a view to applying the proposals contained in Mrs Ghilardotti 's report .
The image of food additives among consumers has deteriorated , even taking account of risk assessments and the concept of the acceptable daily intake .
I welcome the appreciable increase in allocations , especially for rural development , although that increase is mainly directed at the candidate countries .
This will avoid penalising those who comply while offenders get off scot-free .
The poor implementation argument cannot , of course , be used to justify cuts in sensitive areas .
The aim is to ensure that the EU 's financial resources are used effectively in order to attain the goals laid down in its policies , as well as to guarantee continuity with next year 's budget .
I also support the idea of streamlining the rules for submitting applications for structural funds , especially by improving the timetabling and implementation of those funds .
All this is always packaged in the dogmas of service , support for the Stability Pact and flexibility of the labour market .
A full assessment is needed to investigate the introduction of excessive increases , especially for domestic payments , and illegal charges on crossborder payments .
In many cases , however , their contribution is not properly recognised and they do not have the support they need for their quality of life to improve .
I would emphasise the special importance of the statement made in the report under debate here to the effect that the mid-term review of the CAP will only have a positive impact on equal opportunities if its objectives are substantially modified so as to ensure that family-based agriculture and small and medium-sized farmers are given particular prominence .
I want you to know that the people of Portugal were particularly moved by Commissioner Barnier 's statement that he had never seen such a tragedy in the whole of his political career , and by his acknowledgement that the EUR 31 million of aid from the Solidarity Fund was not enough , or , to use his exact words , that it did not come up to expectations .
As you well know , Commissioner , and as you have argued in the past , European solidarity is needed .
Following this debate , Parliament must approve a resolution stating its position on this matter .
I would also like to thank those countries that are not Members of the European Union and that also gave aid .
This was an enormous disaster , one which has worsened Portugal 's already difficult socio-economic situation .
This is necessary not only in order to provide compensation for the social costs incurred but also to help restore productivity in the affected areas and to encourage reforestation .
We call on the Commission to continue working with national authorities , both to minimise the environmental impact and to support the communities affected , but also to aid reforestation by supporting all the government aid initiatives and revising the Forest Focus programme to make its scope broader .
I would also like to thank Commissioner Barnier for making himself available for this debate , for the words he spoke at the start of the debate , for his amicable and thoughtful visit to our country , for the statements he made there and also , of course , for the concern shown by the Commission even before that , through Commissioners Diamantopoulou and Vitorino .
We are therefore dealing with a natural disaster whose devastating human , social and economic consequences have already been mentioned here .
To give you an idea of the situation : in Gavi√£o , a town in the north of the District of Portalegre , on a hill , from a tower behind the church , looking inland towards the horizon ? we are talking about an area many kilometres across ? everything , over the mountains , to the left , to the right , and straight ahead , is scorched .
EUR 50 million is the sum advanced by the Council of Ministers at the height of the Portuguese crisis , and this sum equals the value of national contributions to the restructuring of various Community programmes already mentioned by the Commissioner .
Was this the result of humanity 's own thoughtlessness ?
Some have written that we are , because of our love of bonfires on Saint John 's Eve , and of firework parties .
Most of that woodland ? two thirds ? is made up of pines , used only in construction .
It brings to mind the two original Greek elements of Thales and Heraclitus .
Swift action is needed in Portugal before this shock is forgotten , and this applies to the rest of Europe too .
Mr President , I should like to start by thanking the Commission for its prompt and generous response to the Portuguese Government 's appeal for help in minimising the cost of the damage caused by the fires .
We have an objective assessment of the short-term damage , which runs to about EUR one billion .
