than one school then it must be located in schools on the outskirts and in central schools .
I am convinced that it will only be possible to correctly apply the technical rules governing fishing if fishermen are willing to comply .
My heartfelt appeal today is to avoid a disastrous political error : a true political error since , after resolution 884 , intellectual , political and financial energy was unleashed in Europe , with enormous expectation surrounding the idea of continuing the TEN project .
In specific terms , we need to invest in education , training , research and innovation in order to render our production processes competitive .
In order to create a more favourable climate for companies , the recommendations of the European Employment Taskforce need to be implemented rapidly .
In Italy alone , by 2050 , young people will receive a pension of only one third of their final salary .
I detect a conflict of interest behind these problems , because very often these are companies that are wholly-owned , or at least majority-owned by the State .
I reiterate our firm opposition to dangerous sources such as nuclear power .
Protectionism really serves to defend weak and inefficient companies , or to create national champions artificially .
To have the courage to take that decision means really being a serious European : competitiveness , growth and the well being of citizens , based on an integrated market , are vital to prepare the ground for the birth of the European Constitution .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we find ourselves faced with two possible mergers .
The merger between and , which controls the Belgian company , carries a serious risk of encouraging protectionist trends , not only in the energy sector , but also in other industrial , financial and service sectors .
In other cases , the European Commission has strictly applied its antitrust instruments to prevent the development of dominant positions and retaliation by international competition .
In conclusion , we need the regulatory authority to be strengthened and integrated , antitrust to be strengthened and , in the immediate term , a more active and effective attitude from the Commission .     Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in the last few weeks the Italian UDC-SVP delegation has presented a written question to the Commission in order to highlight the contradictions of a European energy policy apparently in crisis .
A Europe that has created for itself a single currency , that seeks to harmonise laws , legislation , statutes and institutions , that has created a central bank and that has established the Schengen area , cannot be reduced to a game in which national interests prevail over community interests , and where policy is fast taking the place of the market .
We are aware of his very difficult position , particularly after the result of the legislative elections in Palestine .
This does not make us weaker : on the contrary , it opens up the chance for close dialogue , and reassures the Iranian and Syrian people , who feel threatened .
It was actually an example of vengeance and brutal colonialism .
Nor will we be able to confront the problems that the Commission and the Council have very clearly set forth , namely how to succeed in establishing a Mediterranean that is truly cooperative .     .
The European Union must show greater courage on this issue : at stake are our credibility and our policy of promoting human rights .
We must also grant a more important role to international non-governmental organisations , which are truly democratic and independent , through the creation of a UN committee on NGOs , which needs to able to provide both encouragement and criticism for the UN system of human rights .     .
Lastly , I support Amendments 48 and 50 , which are aimed at allowing the involvement of regional authorities in the national checking phase and greater protection of the protected designation of origin ( PDO ) and the protected geographical indication ( PGI ) with respect to other forms of protection like trademarks .
For this reason , we believe that labelling is needed to reveal the indication of the place of origin and processing of a product .
We voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a Council regulation because , with this report , the EU is establishing a system of protection for the producers of ‘regional specialities ’ in the context of agricultural foodstuff production .
I would just like to state that this meeting does nothing to resolve the irregularities committed by the leadership of the IND-DEM Group towards 11 Members forming the so-called minority within the group , who , perhaps not by chance , are also declaring that they are totally unconnected with the obscure events which have brought the leadership of the group to the attention of the European Court of Auditors .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are now discussing another strategy , another paper and another set of priorities ; in the same way in which we debated the others , we would like to place the emphasis on two or three issues – firstly on the agreement concerning the financial perspectives .
The fact that the Commission is not able to say one word – not even one – on the subject of the thousands who have died between Mauritania and the Canary Isles and on the fact that my country , Italy , still has an unknown agreement with Libya that has been hidden from you and from this Parliament , which has caused the death of a huge number of people in that desert , means that debate about a common immigration policy is still just empty words .
