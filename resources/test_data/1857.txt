This problem has been clearly accounted for through one of the so-called buffers , in this case , the capital conservation buffer , which stipulates that a bank cannot pay out dividends if it has not fulfilled the minimum capitalisation requirements .
I am going to prepare a consultation aimed at strengthening this regulation .
Is there a need for a formal legal framework ?

Firstly , individual sanctions must not call into question our current system for controlling infringements , in particular , the leniency programme .
That is why we are keen to propose , as indicated in our White Paper , that we will act on damages actions to check how effective they are and to assess their impact .
The challenge for us , then , is to support this social dynamic , to finance it , and to coordinate it , while at the same time telling ourselves that perhaps one day , it will become self-sufficient , but not yet today .
Health is not only a universal right , but also a part of economic development .
In the plan that I shall be presenting to you in the autumn , on fighting piracy and counterfeiting , I have provided for several sections that we shall be financing and supporting ; on technology for detecting counterfeit goods , on communicating with the European public , and on training personnel in customs or at the external frontiers of the Union .

It is a decision that will have a major psychological impact on the population , for example , on students , who , up until now , have had to form queues in the consulates .
Gang rape , mutilation , gratuitous violence , looting , sordid murders , not to mention the mockery made every day of the most fundamental freedoms , in a State that is in full decline .
We can add impunity to the absence of any action or reaction , the result of a non-existent justice system , as well as Congolese authorities who resign rather than face up to the essential duty of protecting their citizens .

In any case , I wish her every success in this mission .
