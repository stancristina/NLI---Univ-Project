The policy of helping renewable energy to make a breakthrough is just as much an opportunity as a necessity .
Since I am only too well aware that this is a very complex issue , I do not pretend that what has been penned here is the last word in wisdom .
The content of the proposal - due to shortage of time , I will not read it out , as you can all read it in your mother tongue - the actual message of this proposal is that we should mobilize private capital to promote renewable energy in the European Union .
The dismantling of internal borders makes customs points for traffic with third countries the last instance of control to prevent the infringement of property rights by means of the import or export of illegal , counterfeit goods .
Today , the balance of payments in many developing countries is weighted not only by debt , as addressed in the ministerial declaration , but also by other factors , for example , keeping to traditional energy imports .
However , we also know that European Parliament criticism of the fact that not much has been achieved in terms of trade , the environment and social norms is largely down to the developing countries themselves quite understandably dragging their heels on these issues .
What has gone wrong when the developing countries are losing even more of their share of trade ?
Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , I should like to outline my group 's view on this difficult and delicate issue in 10 points .
Five : The European Union must continue its policy of strengthening the economic infrastructure of Palestinian areas .
The Commission 's representatives have made some appropriate suggestions in this respect .
You then decided , quite rightly in my view , to allow another vote on Recital A by way of a check .
Anyone can make a mistake , but I do not believe that we will make any progress if we go back to committee now .
But I leave it to your wisdom to decide whether you want to take the vote again or not .
Five : I also believe we are right to prepare for military intervention if Milosevic does not give way , and therefore I also believe that we must do everything possible to ensure that NATO makes all the necessary preparations for such intervention .
He had even been praised for them .
So we need to exert much greater political and military pressure on Belgrade .
Mr President , Commissioner , on this occasion I , too , am unable to share our view that Europe has acted in a timely manner .
I wonder whether there is not some instrument we could use to tackle the situation , for example by creating an alternative stream of public opinion in Serbia .
There is , however , one thing I should like to emphasize .
It means that if we take ourselves seriously we must do everything we can to get rid of Milosevic .
So far the NATO manoeuvres have been purely symbolic in nature .
Their right of self determination and their very existence were ignored .
The first , Commissioner , relates to an ongoing dispute with you , and that is the issue of labelling in the broadest sense of the term .
This is something which Mr Donnelly from the Socialist Group emphasized quite specifically in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy .
For this reason I , too , submitted several amendments to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy , designed to dismantle the bureaucratic devices which are so costly to business .
For example , we believe , in contrast to Parliament and the Council , that conditions for animals in zoos should be regulated at national level .
And it is timely , because the internal market will quite simply never be completed unless we put an end to harmful tax competition in the European Union and make further progress in the areas of tax alignment and tax coordination .
Whatever happens , the tax oases in the European Union which currently allow transnational companies to transfer profits between countries in order to escape or reduce levels of taxation in their country of registration must be eliminated immediately .
With the code of conduct for corporate taxation and the other two elements of the package dealing with capital earnings and taxes and licence fees between companies , he has achieved the first , important advances in taxation policy .
And to do this we should take up and support the new convergence introduced by Mr Monti and , perhaps , as it has been increasingly watered down , give it back a little of its original shape .
This is our chance to achieve better harmonization in this sector .
The total technical cost of UMTS involves high investment costs , but we all want the end price for the customer to be as attractive as possible .
During these six months we have arrived at the necessary legal guarantees and I believe that we will now be able to move on to commercialisation very quickly .
We are also completely aware , Mr Malerba , that we need to pay great attention to the Radio Conferences .
Rather the other way around !
You have said that there is no risk .
For this reason I should like to know in greater detail exactly what the Commission knew and when .
This is the reason I simply cannot understand why your statement , from which I have just quoted , states in this important area that the question of security is discussed not from the point of view of risks or
