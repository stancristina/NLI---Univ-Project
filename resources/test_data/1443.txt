First and foremost the enormous complexity of the problem , but secondly the fact that the wrong approach was used to tackle the problem .
As long as countries do not tackle trafficking in women in similar ways , do not penalize it in similar ways , do not employ the similar penalties , prison sentences and impoundage of goods , as long as there is inefficient international policing and judicial cooperation , we will not be able to tackle trafficking in women effectively .
Women 's rights are human rights .
The Dutch presidency organized an excellent conference on the prevention trafficking in women , and thoroughgoing agreements were made during this .
The DAPHNE and STOP programmes are in fact a response to the need for an integrated approach , and we should be pleased with this , although we cannot be pleased with the fact that the European Parliament has been so frugal in allocating funds for both programmes for the coming year .
All manner of things have been tried using extremely complicated regulations .
Some sectors can be excluded entirely from compulsory indication of price .
This point continued to cause friction and in the end we made a compromise in which , after three years , the Commission will draft a report on the state of affairs regarding small businesses , and we , after having received the report , will then be able to examine whether they - and this includes small shopkeepers - will have to meet those obligations , or whether we might decide to prolong the general exception for such tiny businesses as corner shops .
Nonetheless , in this House too , there is more sympathy for the position of the monopolistic postal services than for the consumer .
This means that , in future , every President of this House will be able to make use of this facility for a period of three months after the end of his mandate .
The Committee on Agriculture nevertheless adopted it and accepted it because it is also aware of all the cuts which have to be implemented throughout Europe in connection with the introduction of the euro .
One thing became clear .
I would like also to address the President of the Council .
It needs to be linked to the overall budget for the benefit of the farmers but also for the benefit of the overall community .
It is not spent in vain ; it is spent for specific innovation ; it is spent for small and medium-sized businesses ; it is spent for the coal and steel industry and against that background it is important that we support Mr Giansily .
There is nonetheless no reason for euphoria .
During the Dutch Presidency the action plan against major crime was developed .
Because too few staff in this sector of the European Commission shows that evidently too little priority is given to this policy area .
So it is all going too slowly .
Despite over 500 amendments , all noses in the Commission were made to point in the same direction as far as structure and substance is concerned .
Research and technological development in the sphere of ICT must therefore be given a high priority in the fifth framework programme .
We could also think of projects aimed at a specific branch within SME.
I therefore think that what this Parliament has proposed is in agreement with this , and so I hope that this structure will be taken over by the Council .
I think it is important that communal research centres are brought more up to date .
A report from you on this issue would be very welcome .
I can tell you that we have talked with the President and the Secretary-General on numerous occasions , but Parliament is very conservative on this issue .
Mr President , I would like to offer my apologies for having been held up , and arriving a little too late for the reply to my question .
But the general interest is a broad notion which everyone interprets rightly or wrongly , but in any case differently .
The Commission should do something about this .
A charter is too heavy and unsuitable an instrument for this .
The coin will become one of the most visible results of European integration , and respect would have been shown for the citizens if we had been able to influence this process through Parliament .
That is why the European summit in Luxembourg is an historic milestone in the history of European unification .
Ladies and gentlemen , I want to pay tribute to the Luxembourg Presidency , which has done exceptional work in perfect dialogue with the European Parliament .
We also find a paradox , as do you , between an increasingly coherent and structured core around the Euro Council and an eventual enlargement of the European Union to 25 Member States .
The 110 million citizens who are called to cooperate with us , will have to make enormous efforts to integrate their economies into the European Union .
The choice made by the majority of this Parliament a few weeks ago was a different one .
As a result of the effectual cancellation of the start of the negotiations with the other four , Slovakia now enjoys exactly the same conditions .
Europe , after all , has never had the courage to speak plainly to Turkey .
The fact that no one has dared to speak plainly to Turkey leads me to fear that the second possibility is the case , and at any rate has made me a eurosceptic .
This unit of weight can comprise one item of 500 letters of 20 gram .
Progress in the area of justice and home affairs Mr President ,
