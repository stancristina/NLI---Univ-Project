Mr President , Mr Medina and Mrs Plooij have already spoken on the subject of methods .
The European Union 's view , as has incidentally been reasserted in declarations by the Council and by its representative in this House , is that extraterritorial legislation is unacceptable in law and in principle .
Now we have done what we have done , in other words , we have failed to assert those principles ; well , I believe that Europe 's assessment of its own interests cannot be so narrow-minded as to fail to understand that saving our political credibility is more important than a few trade deals !
Many of the representatives of this resistance abroad have been savagely murdered , even in our own capital cities , by Iranian agents sent by Tehran .
Can we tolerate all these things happening without anything ever being said or done ?
The Sudanese Government must not be allowed to think that it can continue defying the entire international community , and for that reason I believe it should agree to a visit by a UN delegation with a view to clarifying the human rights situation in the country and verifying the activities of the international terrorist training camps of which we have heard so much , and which the Council and the Commission , too , would do well to investigate more closely .
The crimes committed in Sudan must be stopped , and our Community must do everything it can to achieve that , if only to prevent these fundamentalist viruses from propagating in our own Western societies , giving rise to hatred and irreconcilable divisions .
We cannot allow this situation to exist : we must do everything in our power to prevent it .
Quite the reverse : a genuinely free system must be based on a rule of law that allows the development of a strong economy - and a strong economy , necessarily , is not based on the exploitation of anyone , still less of women and children .
Indeed , if that were to happen it would be further proof that there is no such thing as a political Europe , and that Europe is incapable of co-ordinating its actions at international level .
To arrive at a social as well as economic dimension , this workforce should be multiplied by three or four to give a global framework for the sector .
Of course , we cannot stop there .
We know that Community law is strongly rooted in precedent , and I therefore feel it is important for this amendment to be adopted .
The first is the activity that favours the exchange of information : understanding each other in order to know each other .
I say all this because we are seeing the birth of other , foreign Euroregions , unfortunately supported by Community funds .
Madam President , Commissioner , I am an elected representative of the two largest islands in the Union which are not home to a European capital city - Sicily and Sardinia - and I must therefore express my continuing regret at the lamentable absence of any integrated Community policy or specific instruments for the European island regions , confronted as they are by an extremely wide range of problems which continue to act as a permanent obstacle to their development .
Commissioner , the United States was instrumental in bringing Laurent Kabila to power in the Democratic Republic of Congo .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we shall not conceal our doubts and concerns as regards the progress of the IGC 's work , as revealed yet again at the recent Noordwijk summit .
Such is the spirit with which , in our opinion , the IGC should be imbued , in order to rewrite a treaty which is no longer equal to the major challenges of the coming decades .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council - as well as the chairman of the representatives negotiating the new draft treaty - whether he has noticed the rare degree of unanimity which has so far echoed around this House in our comments on what is taking place , and on the draft text which he himself has referred to in optimistic terms , unless I am mistaken .
Never before has European foreign and cooperation policy been as negative as in recent years , since the CFSP was codified , and never before has it led to such political inertia .
Certainly not a political union which faithfully reflects European ideals , and certainly not a social Europe which is more than a mere talking-shop , given that certain nations are still putting obstacles in the way of innovative solutions to the tragedy of growing unemployment .
The social clause alone is not enough , and nor is the social protocol ; there is little cause to be optimistic concerning the outcome of the Amsterdam European Council next month .
Certainly not one which interests our citizens , whose concerns lie elsewhere : the unemployment , poverty , social exclusion and violence which are afflicting all the EU countries .
The Amsterdam European Council will in fact be addressing itself to the action plan for the single market , the purpose of which is to establish the timing and mechanisms for all the measures needed to complete a real single market sufficiently in advance of the transition to monetary union , and before the launch of negotiations on further EU enlargement .
The room for manoeuvre here , even following the Growth and Stability Pact , is very limited indeed .
But I feel that it is my duty , and a great pleasure , to comment on what has been said by two such illustrious persons , both of
