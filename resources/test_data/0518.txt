There has to be a real step forward at the Toronto Summit , given its importance for global stability and also for the credibility of the G20 .
No consensus was reached in Busan , Korea , on the idea of such a levy on financial institutions to foster financial stability and strengthen the resolution framework but , on the other hand , there was agreement on developing a common set of principles on burden sharing .
These discussions will continue in Toronto , and I can say from the point of view of the European Commission that we are in favour of broad transparency over the bank stress tests , which are essential to restoring and reinforcing confidence in the European economy .
There is understandably an atmosphere of frenzy in this House .
The attack on the Gaza aid ship has shocked us all , but a few facts need to be coolly stated .
It is the result of weekly attacks on Israel .
The justification for regarding Gaza as a hostile region exists , and the terms of international law on the legality of the sea blockade are being met except on one point : the Treaty of San Remo prohibits the use of a sea blockade to starve a civilian population .
It is a reasonable request , considering there have been two illegal attempts at smuggling missiles by sea .
At least two of the six Israeli soldiers who were the first to land on deck lost consciousness as a result of the beatings , two were shot , probably with pistols taken from the unconscious soldiers , and two escaped with stab wounds and having lost their equipment by jumping into the sea .
From the Israeli Defence Forces ' video and audio material , we may conclude that the commandoes opened fire on the activists after this .
Only on the basis of facts can we draw the right conclusions .
Before that , I wish to present the report by the Committee on Foreign Affairs , whose purpose it is to improve the protection of human rights defenders .
Often , we cannot even precisely tell who the human rights defender is , and it is important that we accept that there are very many types : journalists , lawyers , ordinary brave women and men , who set aside their own interests and stand up for human rights - more often than not , the human rights of others .
Secondly , I am sure that the European Union can do a lot more than it does now .
Parliament , the High Representative , the new European External Action Service , all of us can work together more effectively and exchange information between us .
By this , I am referring to the Council of Europe and the UN , for example , and , obviously , the countless NGOs with which we are continuously in contact .
They are not all new , but I want to point out that some excellent ideas have been put forward that have not , however , been properly put into practice as yet .
When I was drafting this report , I realised that the idea had prompted a major response among various NGOs .
Secondly , I would like to stress the importance of human rights defenders in serious situations being able to get out of a country quickly .
Although our human rights people in the Member States and our foreign affairs ministries are very willing to help , they always have to speak to the Ministry of Internal Affairs , or its equivalent .
Thirdly , the report proposes that the European Parliament , the forthcoming European External Action Service and the EU missions abroad should have liaison officers responsible for the protection of human rights defenders .
Many very important things were said .
There are incredible prison conditions within the European Union .
I also believe that in the near future , we should have the courage to look at the contribution and involvement of some of our Member States in the CIA renditions in the fight against terrorism .
I know it is a very sensitive subject , but I think we should have the courage to look at this again .
This would be the least , I think , we can do to make a positive contribution .
Trade policy is certainly something we should look at more closely to see what we can do , so thank you , Mr Moreira , for contributing to this debate . rapporteur . - Mr President , there seems to be broad agreement between the groups on two oral amendments to this report .
I hope these can be adopted . 2.

Assessment of the results of the 2006-2010 Road map for Equality between women and men and forward looking recommendations ( - Before the vote The report 's basic themes , the preservation and development of the European labour market model , employment contracts of indefinite duration and the tripartite system , and resolving the problems of atypical work and work undertaken in the context of the grey economy , are all worthwhile objectives .
As the threshold for entrepreneurship is lowered , it is also important to ensure that employees are not outsourced as virtual entrepreneurs , who are , for example , worse off than others with regard to their social security and protection against dismissal .
The problems of atypical contracts have been discussed a great deal by the EU 's different institutions .
