Mr President , anyone involved with health knows that the best way to save financial resources and , obviously , human life is prevention .
I hope that this House will do the same , and that the Commissioner will support Parliament 's work and manage to convince the Council this time to do what has to be done in our Europe .
Finally , we agree with the timetable of activities and initiatives of this six months according to the legislative programme which this Chamber has already debated , above all for the intention expressed by the President-inOffice of the Council , Mr Cook , to take serious and determined action against drugs .
Mr President , after listening to Mr Cook 's statement - and I thank him for its clarity - I would like to be able to repeat what was affirmed recently by the British Prime Minister , Mr Blair , in an interview given to the Financial Times , namely that the British Presidency represents a great opportunity to demonstrate that the United Kingdom intends to play a constructive role in Europe and for Europe , and an opportunity to demonstrate that the agenda of economic reforms for monetary union is proceeding .
The list of things to be done was long and has touched the various sectors of activity of the Union .
Why ?
I think that during the six months we will certainly have occasion to deal with our positions and have a dialogue on a subject which I think is very important , which cannot be taken lightly and which thus increasingly requires , in an increasingly integrated Europe , an increasingly single market , a coordinated approach at the European level .
Mr President , in the six months of the British Presidency of the Union , a series of important decisions will have to be taken as regards cooperation with developing countries .
Even up to today some parts of our cooperation have had to beat a retreat faced with the supremacy of other strong interests .
The event of the banana panel is perhaps the most significant example of this .
However , we confirm , we cannot just play a waiting game on an issue which is , moreover , very urgent .
This is the issue which also interests consumers .
A third central element is the relationship between the need for competitiveness and the preoccupation with equality and guaranteeing opportunities to all , especially the weakest and the excluded .
For fifty years we have been maintaining that overcoming the class struggle and eliminating the conflict between capital and labour must essentially come through the participation of employees in the company capital .
I would like to say here that Europe is not only the Europe viewed horizontally , as Mr Cook viewed it this morning , framing it from Edinburgh to Vienna , but it also goes from Edinburgh to Barcelona , to Naples , to Athens .
As regards the legal and institutional aspect , I would mention that Title IV or the new treaty confers on the Council the task of defining , within five years , common rules for crossing external frontiers , visas , asylum and immigration .
I believe that all this makes it urgent and necessary to hold an international conference on the Kurdish question .
Europe is there , but when it is needed it is missing and missing too often !
What Europe do we want to build if we fail once again to demonstrate the capacity or the will to combat effectively the criminality which organizes mass exoduses speculating on the lives of desperate people ?
And still they ask us , they have asked us , starting with the Archbishop of Lecce , whom we met , to formulate a policy on the right of asylum .
From this angle - if you will permit - those who abused our government were twice mistaken , but above all made a grave error : that of demonstrating that this Europe of exposed nerves , of ugly conscience is alive in their person and in their behaviour .
At the November plenary session in Brussels , Sir Leon Brittan commented in detail on the first report .
First , the code of conduct .
This initiative was , unfortunately , not adopted , but the Commission will continue to support the work of the ILO and to look at other means , for example , measures associated with the GSP , to further improve these standards .
I have two further points to make .
Having said that , the Commission welcomes this report .
More specifically , the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1 , 2 , 4 , while Nos 3 , 5 , 5 , 7 and 8 perhaps require a touch of redrafting .
On the final point I am addressing Mr Langenhagen , in particular : I am perfectly aware - we say this every time - of the European Parliament 's request to reach a codecision on the agreements in due form .
Everyone knows that the results of this agreement will also determine the transit conditions for all the other Community Alpine passes , starting with the Brenner , certainly the most delicate , the key point in the great north-south linkage , above all on completion - as soon as possible we hope - of the great rail axis linking , to take a rather optimistic view , Stockholm and Palermo .
They are just keeping to the rules of the game , in sporting terms , and the Commission needs to be very careful to referee properly , because the agreement with Switzerland is at stake and so is internal credibility .
I concur with that statement , although I am very concerned about the current process of globalization and interdependence of economies .
It is a shame , because we
