As I recall , the outcome of this vote was 422 votes to 180 with a few abstentions .
The fact that the subjects are connected also suggests that we should hold the debate on both programmes together .
Thirdly , this directive , as it currently stands in the common position , guarantees - in particular because it confines itself exclusively to minimum standards - a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the European Union ; by adopting it we contribute to the Member States ' bearing a high level of individual responsibility .
I should like to address one final point .
But I believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum , in all countries , whether they are transit countries or not .
In addition , the need for greater transparency has been pointed out .
We observe that there is always a possibility of major problems of this kind occurring where nature gives rise to troublesome phenomena such as mist , storms or cold weather , particularly in the narrow Alpine passes .
Welcome to Parliament !
For example , the question of partnership was simply left out of the central part of the structural funds .
This is what I expect the outcome of the Community development programmes to be , and I do not expect you to give way on this again .
The report demonstrates that - measured in terms of gross domestic product per capita - the poorest regions are beginning to catch up and that is how the situation is set to continue .
In addition , more attention must be given to boosting entrepreneurial potential in small and medium-sized enterprises , and the services they call upon must be developed further .
And those that do pursue such a policy must invest in expansion for the most part and , to a lesser extent , in rationalisation .
The reactions from experts and persons affected range from complete rejection to unconditional support .
However , it will only be possible to form a conclusive assessment once the currently awaited bills produced by the Commission are published .
However , I am convinced of the fact that the White Paper has put us on the right path .
It should continue along this path .
Competition is an instrument and does not always produce ideal solutions .
Hence , what we must focus on today is the question as to how state aid is to be managed in future .
Consequently , Parliament believes it is necessary for the steel aid code to be amended in the light of the industry ' s claims about unequal treatment , and for the Commission to provide the Council with follow-up regulations .
Dropping the obligation to notify will mean less red tape and administration costs , at any rate .
This own initiative must not be destroyed by European intervention .
That is why we should bear in mind what was said by the French writer Vivienne Forestier , who described the state of the world in terms of the economy ' s reign of terror .
The problem of overwork highlighted by the Commission is not a sufficient reason for making radical changes to the legal system .
Mr President , the monopolies ' ban is the key element of functioning competition order in Europe .

For some time now , these abuses have meant that Parliament has been called upon to initiate measures that should serve to protect the European taxpayer ' s money , which , when all is said and done , is what sustains the Union ' s budget .
I support the proposed deadline for the Commission being 30 September in a proposed amendment .
The Court of Auditors publishes its report , which criticises the Member States on account of various incidences of fraud .
There is no doubt that I myself am one of the advocates of this principle and one of those who oppose any further extension of competences at European level .

There is one thing I would ask though : I believe we must prevent the debate on extending the legal basis for OLAF from leading to the misconception that OLAF does not now have enough authority .
In other words , we need real cost-effectiveness for our entire energy supply system .
Thirdly , we need to carry out checks on these safety and insurance certificates in the ports , that is in every port of the European Union .
We need to have a long memory when we say : " for once we are united , at last as far as port charges and requirements are concerned , and will not play one off against the other in the European Union . "
