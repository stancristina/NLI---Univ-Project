world capitalism .
In conclusion , I wish to point out that the life of companies is too important a matter to be left to financiers alone .     – Mr President , for years , the boss of Parmalat had to use the same language to his 36 000 employees , scattered among thirty countries , as all bosses use to their workers .
The financial world , the media and political circles were satisfied with the appearance of success , and neither the auditors , nor the bankers , nor the rating agencies , nor even the Italian regulators questioned the accounts published by Parmalat .
Conflicts of interest between the various supervisory and auditing functions etc . should also be avoided , but it is not a question of punishing the banks and other financial operators .
There is one area in which it would be as well to maintain our efforts : that of flags of convenience because , in my view , as long as it is possible , through a lawyer covering for an anonymous and ultra-rich owner , to register a ship in Panama for USD 1 500 , and to do so with complete discretion , threats will continue to hang over sailors and the environment .     Mr President , it is essential that , in order to prevent abuses and to avoid temptation , the tasks devolved to the Community agencies be defined very precisely , even though the number of such agencies is tending to multiply at an alarming rate .
Finally , we must support the Afghan Government in its fight against opium growing , with a view to helping it to find effective alternative solutions .
Afghanistan and Iraq are both countries with a tribal structure where local bosses and ethnic and religious leaders only want to take the biggest slice of the national cake .
So why do we not focus on the issue of women today in Afghanistan ?
A great deal of progress has indeed been made , at least in the constitutional text : political power exercised by constitutional representatives , representation of women , equality between men and women written in black and white , respect for linguistic diversity considered as an asset and not as a threat and , finally , respect for the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .
We are well aware that , in the evaluation of the association agreements , the constraints of the on the part of the States are terrifying .
A year ago , a Spanish judge ordered the closure of , the only daily newspaper in the Basque language , and imprisoned several journalists – some are still in prison .
I would like to express some reservations however .
Then , the EU must stop giving public subsidies to this type of company .
I would insist , under these circumstances , and we have already told you this – I remember in particular the speeches by Mr Langen and Mrs Flautre , last year – on the fact that we do not want a new communication on the interpretation of the Treaty and jurisprudence .
Will you state that your executive texts are of a provisional nature while we await the adoption of the corresponding legal act ?     – Mr President , I believe that in this debate our problem is not so much to reopen all the discussions we have held time and time again on the meaning and the nature of services of general interest , but to deal with the issue of security and the framework , and more precisely that of the democratic security and the democratic framework , within the context of the debate on services of general interest .
However , has any consensus been reached on the need for democratic clarity mentioned by Mrs Flautre ?
Where is transparency ?
It is , after all , an elementary principle of good democracy to answer yes or no after so many years .     Mr President , Commissioner , today in Iran the conflict between conservatives and reformists threatens once again to throw an entire nation of this great Middle East into obscurantism and fundamentalism , into a pernicious and despairing arbitrariness .
In short , Iran is essential to us and yet , within a month , it has destroyed our hopes of seeing it make progress in terms of democracy .
The Cambodian Parliament must take up its duties again , and a serious agreement must be ratified , not a compromise which looks more like a masquerade between the UN and the Government , with a view to creating a special tribunal with responsibility for judging the crimes against humanity perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge .
But without high-quality education and training , it is illusory to imagine that we shall achieve our objectives in terms of growth , employment and social cohesion .
Indeed , without public and private investment in research , the economy of the Union will stagnate , deprived of its motive force , which is knowledge .
This report identifies several priority areas for action .
This , indeed , is the message of the Commission ’s spring report and of the interim report .
Moreover , Community programmes , which are veritable innovation laboratories , contribute to reforms and adjustments of education systems and serve to promote the sharing of experience .
To this end , we must focus our efforts on high-tech sectors such as health and biotechnology , defence and space – the Galileo programme sets a good example in this respect – state-of-the-art telecommunications and renewable sources of energy .
Where special efforts are really required is in the domain of minimum European standards with regard to labour legislation and the social security of permanently mobile workers , standards that will prevent any unfair competition based on low pay and poor working conditions
