the next part-session regarding the decisions that the General Affairs Council adopted on matters of sensitive institutional importance without consulting the European Parliament .
I do not consider this appropriate and I think it should be corrected .
The European reference framework on combating corruption is still fragmented , non-binding and in need of a bold step forward .
Madam President , I believe we should always pay great attention to our behaviour and political actions towards the countries with which we have relations and agreements in matters of cooperation and aid .
I believe we must make a major effort in the fields of cooperation and trade and carry out political analysis in the areas of development and education , and I also believe that the human rights of all people should be upheld , even those accused of terrorism .
For its part - and in saying this I am simply describing the situation and not wishing to be judgmental - the Musharraf regime is essentially a consequence of the fact that there was previously a string of corrupt governments .
The MMA , the party that brings together the various fundamentalist strands , will create problems for Musharraf and for the government that is to be formed .
Just as much prudence is needed , I believe ( and the report gives a very well-balanced definition in this regard ) when citing new rules as a panacea for the ills or difficulties that the markets may encounter , especially if public control is mentioned .
For instance , the scope of the directive is specified and the use of traditional herbs in other areas , such as foods , food supplements and cosmetics is excluded .
As a specialist in the area - I am a pharmacologist - I believe that ten years ' use in Community Member States added to 20 years ' use outside the Community is sufficient to assess any potential toxic effects .
I am therefore in favour of reducing the 15 years laid down in the initial Commission proposal , but I do not agree with Chris Davies 's amendment , which does not provide for at least ten years ' use in the European Union , not least in that , given the genetic make-up of different populations , without extensive use in the Member States severe toxic effects might still emerge .
I do not wish to add much , or even anything , to the opinion already expressed in the debate by the Commissioner and so many other Members on the question of temporary work .
Parliament can debate today , and tomorrow , I hope , it will be able to adopt a report that improves the Commission proposal .
Madam President , President Maystadt , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the European Parliament for having once again taken the initiative of organising a debate on the work of the EIB .
The Commission acknowledges Parliament 's wish to evaluate the impact on SMEs of the ' Multiannual Programme 2001 - 2005 on small and medium-sized enterprises' , known as the MAP.
The third point : with regard to the EIB 's work in the candidate countries , the Commission endorses Parliament 's view that absolute priority must be given to the Bank 's activities in these countries .
I certainly support the major undertaking of the EIB in the candidate countries , but objective 1 regions should not be forgotten : even after they no longer have this status , they should be monitored as appropriate and given substantial credit support so that they can conclude their development process - certainly not fully completed - by 2006 .
Allow me to set out the main features of our competition policy in the state aid sector .
I will now , if I may , respond to some of the points raised in Mr Herzog 's report .
Work being carried out by the Council regarding the Commission proposal - a proposal fully supported by Parliament , which once again , I would thank - is now nearing completion .
Even though this is the highest number of prohibition decisions issued in a single year , this figure continues to represent only around 1.5 % of all final decisions .
Regardless of whether or not we appeal to the Court of Justice , it is right and proper that the Commission learns as many lessons as possible from certain assessments which have been made and , accordingly , the reform will be even more far-reaching and sweeping .
The other improvements to the decision-making process which I plan to propose include : the formalisation and extension of the existing system of cross-checks in all cases which reach second phase investigations ; greater transparency , allowing access to the dossier and dialogue between opposing market views at an earlier stage than is currently the case ; more human resources in the Competition Directorate-General , both in order to work in a more appropriate fashion with regard to the high standards set by the Court and to improve our economic analysis capabilities .
Whatever kind of reform is considered in order to achieve a successful system , it is , in any case , important not to lose sight of the many merits of our administrative system .
In particular , I am unable to consider one point which I know , however , to be of great interest to the Chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , Mrs Randzio-Plath , and that is international cooperation , an area in which considerable progress has been made over the last year .
There are other unresolved issues : former state monopolists - starting with EDF , Enel , France Télécom , Deutsche Telekom - state aid for broadcasting , state aid in the event of structural adjustments and , in this context , also state aid disguised as something else .
