we must work towards disarmament , and I think we can achieve more if we have a common policy rather than all acting individually - that the armaments industry in Europe cannot simply be closed down if we want to have products that meet our requirements , but it is in grave danger at the moment .
We are delighted that Parliament has been able to discuss such a sensitive issue , and we hope that we shall achieve a successful outcome .
He complains about the unequal balance of trade , unfair competition and the development of powerful equipment with the best possible price/quality ratio .
They must be covered by strict codes of conduct , with an annual report to the European Parliament .
There are just a few further comments I should like to make , however .
In presenting a list of demands from the European Union , we must not forget the war and the underlying tensions which caused it .
We cannot hope to solve all the problems in the Balkans overnight .
There are several countries here which have just emerged from a terrible war with each other and still harbour various grievances .
I would prefer to give Romania a more prominent role , especially now that it has a more constructive government .
I would therefore urge that we should vote for the section on this subject in the Cohn-Bendit report , as amended , since this is how we can genuinely promote the international rule of law .
That is where the real problem lies , and I would urge the Commission to consider possible ways to get round this in the meantime , since we feel that the current system works to the disadvantage of European importers .
We spoke out clearly in favour of finding solutions to explosive problems such as that of the refugees .
But it is hard to find words to protest at what we find so very sad , to give expression to our sense of bitterness .
Perhaps you have forgotten , ladies and gentlemen , but we declared that 1997 was to be the year of combating racism .
While we are talking here , tens or possibly hundreds of people are being murdered , and we are drawing up communiqu√©s .
She has said throughout the world what Europe should have done , but she did not have the means to do it .
That must be the decisive factor .
I think the honourable Member is right in referring to the political and economic importance of the Cohesion Fund .
I believe that the honourable Member is right to ask for attention to be given to this kind of phenomenon , but I repeat - and this is an established part of the whole political and legal system of the Community - that Member States have the freedom - and I would add on behalf of the Council that they must have it - to adopt measures in certain sectors , including goods traffic , which they regard as being in the interest of public order and the safety of their citizens .
We are indeed dealing with something of a question of principle here , namely how a body of the European Community should handle information .
Once again , I would regard it as unwise if we were to make any protected business information held by the Commission available for public discussion , other than on the basis of the rules for publishing this kind of protected information .
We are now waiting to see the results of this undertaking by the US administration , and if the Commission and the Council in any way have the impression that the American administration will not be able to fulfil the agreements , then we shall not hesitate to restart the WTO panel .
Precisely because of this , it is extremely important that information which is available in Member States - for instance on new substances which in principle fall under drugs legislation - is analysed and exchanged as quickly as possible , so that these new substances can also be outlawed in the legislation of the various Member States and the judicial and police authorities then have a legal basis for responding to them quickly .
This involves making it impossible to use modern coding and scrambler technology in such a way that intelligence and security services are no longer able to do anything .
The only solution that we in the Liberal Group can see is to reduce fleet capacity , because tighter controls do not provide sufficient guarantees .
We have had serious talks on the subject with Senegal and Namibia , which led to the setting-up of a fisheries working party under the ACP-EU Joint Assembly .
International fisheries face the same problem as do the Union 's own waters : a catch capacity which is too large for fish stocks to be maintained .
I therefore agree with the rapporteur that we must try to replace these agreements with second or third-generation agreements , under which the financial aid goes to benefit research , training , monitoring systems and other activities in the domestic fishing sector .
But even the safest power station is manned by people .
The Commission must safeguard conditions for competition now that the electricity market has been opened up .
This means that there can be no subsidising of new nuclear power stations , either by national governments or by Europe .
And secondly , if research into nuclear technology is being carried out and subsidised under the European fifth framework programme , is that not tantamount to subsidising nuclear energy and does that not distort the internal market ?
Mr President , the Liberal Group has tabled three amendments , two of which concern the promotion of energy from biomass
