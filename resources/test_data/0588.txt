up with the national aims of different Member States .
That means that gas emissions will increase if nothing is done about it .
Fourthly , it is realistic to suppose that the use of gas , and specifically imported gas , will increase rapidly .
All these large-scale trends can be influenced positively by increasing the combined production of heat and power .
The production of energy , however , is not the affair of the EU.
The CARNOT programme , which aims at improved fuel efficiency , simply does not have the resources , and there are even fewer to spread the word on the combined production of heat and power .
Mr President , when national leaders meet in Cardiff , public interest will clearly focus on how unemployment can be reduced and what is going to be done about it in practice .
Merely examining national programmes will not necessarily be sufficient to tell if the strategy for growth and employment is working at the pan-European level .
I believe we need a European contribution to programmes to reduce long-term unemployment and unemployment among young people .
The success of an active employment policy is ultimately the yardstick by which we can gauge whether Europe can solve the mass unemployment crisis of post-industrial society .
He forgot to mention that the football championships will start in June ; maybe that is also due to the British efforts .
The answer is No.
Everybody is talking about the weather , nobody is doing anything about it .
Everybody is talking about foreign policy but where is the substance ?
General politics remains the heart of the matter within the Union .
The Spencer Report clearly shows that there is almost no progress in the foreign policy field .
Madam President , this report had to be produced hastily , and that may be the reason for its general nature .
The Commission has for the first time taken a genuine step forward in the direction of concrete targets for employment with these broad guidelines which they have laid down for the economy , and our group is very satisfied .
We wish to emphasize that employment must really be the focal point of the coordination of economic policy in the future .
We must absolutely ensure that national economic resources are targeted at growth and sustainable action .
We should be able to make it more and more costly to pollute the environment by fiscal means , and correspondingly be able to then lower income tax .
My group would like to state that it will be terribly important that a counterweight is created through a truly common economic policy , so that the ECB does not ascend to a position that is too dominant .
The total amount for the budget is 916 million euros , which is in accordance with the Bureau 's proposal .
This represents a rise of 5.2 million euros on this year 's figure , or 0.6 % .
The proportion of costs in relation to total EU administrative costs is also below 20 % , which falls in with Parliament 's previous level of commitment .
That is why the budgetary change , and in particular staffing costs , have demanded much restraint .
The experience of already two and a half years has shown that it is necessary to have one .
As the institution of the Ombudsman has been once and for all established by a unanimous decision by Member States , it should at least be given the modest resources it requires , or else the whole system will turn against its very own aims as matters pile up and decisions take so long to be made .
The proposal by the Ombudsman for six interim posts is modest when we consider the quality of the work done by the institution and the vast area their work covers , as well as the incredibly short period of time they have had to develop .
In all other respects I endorse the acceptance of the report .
I also wish to draw your attention to the European Ombudsman 's budget .
The Ombudsman 's office has been now running long enough to judge what sorts of staffing levels are necessary for a sufficiently up-to-scratch and speedy service for the citizens of the Union .
In his report Mr Viola suggests establishing three new posts to ease the work pressures on the Ombudsman 's office .
The problem , however , is not only the number of new posts , but , more particularly , their professional level .
Otherwise we create a situation where the European bureaucrats are racing finely-tuned Formula 1 cars against the Ombudsman 's Mazda 323 family saloon .
The Commission is proposing to keep the quota system as it stands , in order to make the Community 's starch markets more viable .
Because of its cold climate , crop rotation in Finland is in much greater evidence than it is in Central Europe .
Because of that , it is difficult to apply the conditions of production to the quota 's 5 % flexibility limit .
This is the proposal to be able to deviate from the quota by 10 % .
It is clearly evident from both the Commission 's report and Mrs Kla√ü ' report that there are problems in how to use Structural Fund resources to best effect .
This means that considerable appropriations have to be used the following year for spending commitments from the planning stage .
In addition , the size of the administrative machine does not always accord with the sum of money to be spent .
Furthermore , comments on the vagueness surrounding the use of Structural Funds testify not only to the complicated nature of the administrative process but to a lack of clarity in the area of who is responsible for what .
