born into and are prevented from leaving .
I look forward to continuing the dialogue with Mrs Járóka and others at European level .
We believe that this is an important issue , which will also be important in the future , especially when we look at enlargement with Bulgaria and Romania , where the minority is quite large .     Mr President , when a bad atmosphere exists in the Union , closer attention should be paid to the sort of image it is presenting of itself in the Member States .
At the start of the year , Finland announced a wolf management plan , but the case continues .
The European Union is more unpopular than ever in Finland and news like this tends to lay the subject of integration open to ridicule .
There are certain matters which it is easier to assess locally , and the hunting of wolves is one of them .     Mr President , life would not be possible without good-quality groundwater .
With this directive we must be able to ensure that intentionally or unintentionally harmful substances cannot get into groundwater .
Related to this is the fact that , for historical reasons and owing to natural conditions , there are different sources of emissions in the various Member States .
Resources should be allocated effectively in order that groundwater quality can improve everywhere in Europe and , furthermore , that the high quality that results can be preserved and maintained .     Mr President , Commissioner , a common research policy for the European Union should produce the sort of scientific and economic added value that is not achievable through the efforts and actions of individual Member States and private companies .
An example of a good joint project is the financing of fusion energy research associated with the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor ( ITER ) .
This is a project which individual Member States should not try and implement alone .
Energy-guzzling humanity can ill afford not to examine this possibility .
In that respect , money for research will not be wasted , even if we never succeed in taming the actual fusion process so that more energy is produced using it than is needed to get the process started .
At the same time we need to do more research into renewable energy sources and make more use of them , and in this respect I am of the same opinion as the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance .     . – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , I would like to mention health and energy .
The Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety wishes to increase the share of the research budget relating to health .
These are the diseases which the world’s poor suffer from , though these people are of no interest to the pharmaceutical firms .
Financing for energy must match our commitments to climate , because otherwise there is a danger that we will lag behind the United States of America and Japan in the development of new technologies .
It is foolish for us to continue with the distorted policy that has gone on for decades whereby we allocate more funds to research into nuclear energy via Euratom than the total for EU funds for other areas of energy research .
We tabled as many as 1 700 amendments , so this would have been enough for an Eighth Framework Programme .
The Scientific Council is one of the most significant new additions to the Framework Programme , and it will be the first genuine pan-European research funding institution .
There is a real need for support for top-quality research .
We should also ensure that good use is made of the fruits of research .
Article 169 of the Framework Programme also provides a tool for strategic cooperation between the Member States , and that is what we need .
Our investment programme is lagging behind both the United States and Japan .
In the information and communications sector we have succeeded in creating a good number of commercial applications .
We have , however , put up obstacles such as intricate patent legislation , which is eroding our competitiveness .
It is using all the means at its disposal to encourage the Tunisian authorities to make progress in this crucial area .
The Commission has also closely followed the events and incidents that occurred during the congress of the on 27 May .
I very much regret that she was threatened by the security services and find this totally unacceptable .
Hence , on 5 June 2006 , a meeting took place between the Tunisian Minister of Foreign Affairs , Mr Abdallah , and the EU Ambassadors in Tunisia .
Unfortunately , the Tunisian authorities remain reticent over the issue of this league .
We shall continue to press the Tunisian authorities to rapidly unblock these .
Moreover , it provides for the creation of a human rights subcommittee where the implementation of such commitments will be jointly assessed and monitored .
Mr President , it is clear that the situation in Tunisia as regards human rights continues to be very serious , not least where freedom of expression is concerned .
Both international and local human rights organisations , unfortunately , report an increasing number of cases of concern .
The Commission will continue closely to monitor developments and will use all the means at its disposal to improve the situation .
It is evident that a dialogue on human rights must also include individual cases .
I hope that conditions can be established for a fair and smooth implementation of the MEDA project on modernisation of the judiciary , to which there was a reference , a project for which we have a budget of EUR 22 million .
