to the fact that fisheries-based industry and gutting and canning firms must have raw materials , and it is therefore now time for us to review the tariff barriers that prevent the raw materials from reaching our companies in the EU.
Price mechanisms and tariff barriers mean that the prices for these raw materials are very much higher than the prices for the same raw materials on the world market .
Mr President , as has already been mentioned on quite a few occasions , the budgeting for 2004 is particularly exciting and particularly complicated because of enlargement and the continued reforms of EU budgeting .
I should like to begin by thanking Mr Mulder and Mrs Gill for their constructive and well set-out discussion documents for the work on the 2004 budget .
In this context , I would especially mention the need for the Commission 's reforms to be implemented in such a way that the administration becomes genuinely efficient and is made sufficiently flexible for it to be possible , once and for all , to straighten out those problems that led to the Commission 's departure in 1999 .
It may be argued that enlargement will provide special opportunities for sorting out a number of problems .
As Mrs Gill mentioned , that also applies , of course , in relation to our own institution , Parliament , which will no doubt have to be persuaded to tidy up its administration .
That also applies to the budgets for the agencies in the spheres of training and the labour market .
The last point I wish to make is that , upon enlargement , the EU will acquire new borders in the east .
In the budget , aid to the former Soviet bloc countries is to be provided through the Tacis programmes which provide money for administrative development , training and the promotion of safety in connection with nuclear power stations .
Nuclear safety , in particular , is a high political priority .
I think that , with their more detailed knowledge of our new neighbours , they will have some good ideas as to how , in the future , we can generally develop the Tacis programmes and also ensure that they are efficiently implemented .
It is , then , also only natural that the two topics be linked , since they are two sides of the same coin .
The fact is , moreover , that an economic policy that increases competitiveness and flexibility and so improves the economic incentives for creating jobs is the core of employment policy .
Mr Mann 's report emphasises that we must have a stronger commitment to training , to improved incentives for accepting and creating jobs and to less bureaucracy and more flexibility in the labour market .
Unfortunately , the common employment policy is seen , from the job figures and unemployment statistics , not to be an unqualified success .
We are much too far from the ambitious targets set in Lisbon three years ago .
No, they were not ; but there are trend-setting countries that do not feel sufficiently bound by the promises .
I agree with the proposal you have tabled , Commissioner , for simplifying and clarifying the open coordination of employment policy with a view to having fewer guidelines .
Furthermore , we must also become much better at monitoring and ensuring that the Member States do in fact feel bound by the fine promises given at the Lisbon Summit , and this also applies to the large countries .
Mr President , since the Lisbon European Council set itself the target of making the EU the world 's most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy by 2010 - an economy that can create sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion - we can ask ourselves how matters have developed since then .
The increases in the United States 's and our own competitiveness have been so markedly different that the discrepancies between the United States and the EU have increased , rather than decreased , since that target was set .
As will have become apparent from the debate in Parliament , there is too much bureaucracy and there are too many regulations .
What we lack is training , better access to capital and a long list of structural changes to enable us to cope successfully in the new knowledge-based economy .
The key to progress will be more basic research so that the new knowledge can quickly be converted into exciting , well-paid and interesting jobs .
He emphasises the importance of small and medium-sized businesses and sets out a long list of initiatives that I believe will enhance the process .
- ( DA ) The June Movement abstained from voting in the vote on Amendment No 8 , tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists , the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance , to item 12 concerning the place to be given to European political parties in the budget .
We do not therefore wish to get involved in the technical elaboration of such a system .
Iraq Mr President , what is this war about ?
As the weapons inspectors become more successful in their work , the purpose of the war is , however , changing .
Excuse me , but I thought the idea was to disarm Iraq and destroy its weapons of mass destruction .
The picture I now have is of the UN 's far exceeding the limits of its powers and replacing regimes we do not like .
We do not like Saddam Hussein .
I am not friendly with any of them , but that only shows of course how broad the anti-war movement is , and how narrow the movement in favour of war is gradually becoming
