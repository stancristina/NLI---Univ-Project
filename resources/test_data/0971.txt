If we do not do so I believe we shall continue to be excluded from negotiating tables and be reduced to bankrolling major international events .
The present perspectives would allow an additional 5 000 billion .
It takes account of two key issues , namely the concerns and expectations of the citizens on the one hand , and on the other , the conditions needed to allow the budgetary authority to reach a consensual decision .
I have to say that I am amazed the Council is not represented in the House today .
Further , my group strongly supports adjustment of the current system of distinguishing between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure .
This would ensure an effective response to unexpected situations .
In addition , if the treaty were applied to the letter it would not be in line with the reality of present day budgets .
This cannot be allowed to continue .
It would then no longer be possible to allege , as is often the case , that unemployed citizens in eastern Germany are subsidising large landowners in Andalusia .
Other honourable Members will speak on further aspects of our stance .
A hard core of 7.4 % of the unemployed have never actually worked , have lost their job , or face major obstacles in getting back into work .
The proposal we are debating today encompasses three main objectives .
I congratulate Mr Mann and call for a vote in favour of this report .
Further to the statements made by the rapporteur and by Mr Pronk , I find I am bound to state strong opposition to all the amendments .
It is not acceptable to maintain that it was over-ambitious to hope to attain the rates of employment set at Lisbon .
Any reform of the Central Bank must comply with four conditions .
It is therefore based on the premise that the system legally in force may not be modified .
I should like to return to this when I have heard what Mr Friedrich has to say .
Improvements are called for , however , to clarify the frequency and order of rotation in this type of voting .
This is because according to legislation currently in force , every Member of the Council must have a voting right .
We should be prepared to tackle it at the next Intergovernmental Conference on the basis of a different model .
It might be the system detailed in Mr Friedrich 's report or it might be different again .
There is no doubt that the model presented by the Central Bank does provide for a weighting of the countries based on their respective financial and economic significance .
The enabling clause does however provide for this .
Mr President , I would like to thank you for kindly suggesting that the Commission should reply to my question in writing , but I would prefer my question to lapse in accordance with the Rules of Procedure .
Let us continue with rice .
How can we prevent the 40 poorest countries in the world , by means of multinationals we all know , which import rice , some of them here , from introducing these products via the poorest countries and wrecking our markets ?
It says that everybody else , particularly the national governments , must do their duties : they must maintain the evolution of salaries linked to productivity , introduce measures in terms of the transparency of prices and reform their structures in order to increase productivity , in order to give the European Central Bank a margin , an additional margin , in the event that it is considered necessary to reduce interest rates , particularly if we want to bring interest rates into line with European export needs .
We call for a new industrial policy , because people cannot live on services alone , as well as an effort in the field of renewable energies , on which I do not need to insist given the international climate .
I will deal initially with the three relating to the general economic situation , the Stability and Growth Pact and public finances and finally I will comment on the report by Mr Olle Schmidt on the specific case of Sweden .
We know that increases in productivity - you have referred to this yourself - and growth in employment are also closely related to the evolution of salaries , and that it is essential that salaries are compatible with reasonable evolution of employment and with increases in productivity .
I believe we all agree that restructured public finances are essential not only in terms of allowing monetary policy to play its role , but also in order to provide the necessary margin so that the automatic stabilisers can function in a cyclical situation .
In its analysis of the pact , however , the Commission has seen that in certain cases temporary deviations are justified provided that they are for reasons aimed at improving growth .
I believe it is essential to make progress on coordination and in this regard the broad guidelines for economic policy are intended to make improvements , not only by means of the tri-annual approach , but also by paying more attention to application reports than to general approaches .
Though I have said this several times , it is perhaps worth repeating that we insist in our communication on certain fundamental points . 3 % is still the nominal deficit limit ; however , we have to take account of the evolution of the cycle and therefore the evolution of cyclically adjusted deficits is an essential element .
However we have yet to deal with those two elements which I hope can be resolved in the future .
The immediate aim of this debate is essentially to prepare for the Spring Council and it is intended to respond to the
