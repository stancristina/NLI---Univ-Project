Do we want there to be Community regulation , if all the stages in examining body scanners are passed , or do we want to leave using this tool up to individual Member States ?
We do find some consequences of that , including for individuals , and we must ensure that the consequences for individuals are as slight as possible , by ensuring that there are no recordings , no notes and no infringements of privacy or fundamental human rights .
We welcome the letter that you sent to Mr Deprez , chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , in which you make a commitment that we would like to take as an official commitment .
We need some more data in order to be able to make a confident decision on how useful these body scanners are . on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , Mr Tajani , ladies and gentlemen , it seems to me that this is first and foremost a procedural problem and not a problem on the substance of the issue , on which it is clearly not difficult to find agreement .
The first is that in recent years airports have become the places in which the 'security ' obsession finds its prime application .
It is no accident that the main cradle of this strategy is the body : Foucault says that through the political technology of the body we can read the shared history of power relations .
The workshop that we have arranged for 6 November , which will include representatives of the Member States and MEPs , will be an opportunity - not that it is the only one , since it might be the first of a series of specific meetings - to assess all aspects of the use of body scanners , starting with what I consider to be the most important , human health .
Otherwise we will not do anything .
Today there is a manual body search : any official who touches a citizen inappropriately is violating their privacy and breaking the rules , and is thus not abiding by the law .
The MEPs who have been invited to the workshop will also participate in the assessment .
All of this is fully in keeping with the goals set out in the Lisbon strategy launched by the European institutions at the dawn of the new millennium .
It identifies better regulation as one of the pillars underpinning the growth of the economy and jobs in Europe .
Member States must now adopt the necessary legislative , regulatory and administrative provisions to comply with the directive within three years of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .
With the massive expansion of new technologies , which are gradually becoming more accessible , children are ever more exposed to risks of illegal content such as harassment , child pornography , bullying , incitement to anorexia , and so on .
It must commit itself to ensuring cooperation , greater respect for human rights and religious freedom , by repealing the provisions in its law that criminalise dissent and by putting an end to censorship .
My office and my staff are available to provide you with all the necessary information to enable you to report to your electorate .
The Commission therefore gives much consideration to these links .
How will it contribute towards establishing a reliable system of transportation ( boat-aeroplane-helicopter ) which covers the small island regions of the European Union ?
It is up to the Member States and regional authorities to decide on the quantity and quality of connections within the small island regions and between these regions and the continent .
Commissioner Tajani , since you have spoken in Italian I am tempted to do so myself , but I will hold back and speak in Greek instead .
Mr Botopoulos , I said this myself when I was a member of parliament , having been elected in a constituency that also included many small islands , and so I am well aware of the serious connection problems they face , far from terra firma , particularly during the winter .
I think that I mentioned this during my main speech , with which I answered the question .
The Commission 's proposals in this sector take particular account of the relevant international conventions .
This happened , for example , when we introduced the accelerated withdrawal of single-hull oil tankers and our decision was then followed by a similar one on the part of the International Maritime Organisation .
Moreover , you always have an answer for me .
I can assure you that , as far as the Commission 's commitment is concerned , we will continue to monitor the situation with care and attention , including through the work of our agency in Lisbon , to ensure that all Community legislation is always complied with and , above all , to ensure that our seas are ever more secure , with joint legal and operational action in all seas within the competence of the European Union .
Clearly the European Commission does not have jurisdiction on this : these are areas that concern the Member States , but we , on the basis of the principle of subsidiarity which , as you all know , is derived from the word subsidium , want to help the Member States and the mayors of large cities .
The former mayor of Milan , Gabriele Albertini , Vice-Chairman of the Committee on Transport and Tourism , can testify to all this : through this action plan , we will ensure that all of the information we have , all of the advice , all of the ideas , all of the suggestions , can be made available to
