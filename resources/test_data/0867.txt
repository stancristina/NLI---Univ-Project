The future will tell whether Laeken has been an historic turning point .
I willingly concede that the important thing is that we establish a balance between the institutions , that one institution does not completely dominate another .
And I believe that the European Union must retain its own character .
We must not only talk of perspectives , which is clearly very important , but at the same time we must try to educate young people in relation to Europe , to explain to them how we work , to explain to them that Europe deals much more directly with their concerns than people believe or than the press indicates .
The work carried out by Mrs Onckelinks from this point of view , with Mr van den Broek , is absolutely remarkable and they have played a crucial role , in our view at least , in the success of the Belgian Presidency .
I hope that one day - as I have already said , but I will repeat it - I will be able to return to this House to refresh my spirit .
Apart from the expected launch of the Convention , Laeken has provided few concrete results .
This would increase the Union ' s income and allow us to reduce the current national contributions .
I wish it success , and I hope that in two years time we may have a constitution which all the citizens of the European Union can read and understand , and that we finally establish the principle of directly electing the President of the European Commission .
My second point concerns the praesidium , which I shall be part of together with my friend and colleague Antonio Vitorino .
What I am trying to say is that we shall have to produce work that is responsible and useful , and that can be used by the European Council , which will then have to go on to make the final decisions .
I am deeply conscious of the fact that everything I have achieved in this Parliament has been achieved through working with colleagues across the political spectrum .
Reform will only be possible if the President has the support of all Members across the whole House .
I dream foolishly of having such stimulating sittings that there will be more Members present in the Chamber than interpreters in the booths .
I must also listen when a Member of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left draws my attention to the fact that some of our employees are facing job insecurity or when a Member of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party asks me to intervene because some of our disabled Members need additional assistance .
And I would like to congratulate the person who enabled us to carry out all these reforms and many others .
One of the main characteristics of my candidacy is its firmly left-wing stance .
Within my group , then , staunch federalist Members sit alongside and cooperate with Members who are deeply attached to the sovereignty of their country .
I thank Mr Wurtz for his kind remarks earlier today .
In acknowledging all those who voted for other candidates , now that the matter is settled I hope we can develop a genuine stakeholder presidency committed to building in this Parliament and in the Union a Union and a Parliament fit for Europe 's future .
I come from the western seaboard of Europe , from the edge of our European world , and I have a deep pride about where I come from .
Reuniting Europe brings together a divided Europe to share common values and economic prosperity . )
My friends , thank you for this extraordinary privilege .
Given what you said , and your whole record in this House , I know you will work to defend every Member 's rights and interests ; that you will be fair across the political spectrum ; that you will be articulate in defending the rights of this Parliament externally and robust with the other institutions , when necessary .
I am looking forward to it ! ( Laughter and sustained applause )
And we are democrats .
But that is how things stand at the end of the day .
In difficult situations , when he was told that he had two options , he used to reply : ' In that case , I choose the third . '
On the other hand , there is a sector , and I would draw your attention to this , where these two categories are more than amply represented , and that is the cleaning staff , the people whose job is to look after our comfort .
Mr President , my machine is not working .
You are not breaking new ground , in particular , in the area that you have made your priority as a head of government , Mr Aznar ; in other words , the fight against terrorism .
' MÃ¡s Europa' also implies that Catalan , a language spoken by almost 10 million Europeans , can be established in this House .
As far as the fight against terrorism is concerned , there is , unfortunately , no need to dwell at length on the tragedies that too often plunge the people of Spain into mourning , as they fall victim to barbaric acts carried out by ETA and its counterparts .
We must bring about a strong , powerful , and therefore democratic , political Europe .
Obviously , shopkeepers are unable to identify potential forgeries which are worth , if you will forgive me for saying so , more than 3 500 of our poor old francs , in other words , half the minimum wage in France .
Everyone realises , when doing their shopping , that prices are soaring ,
