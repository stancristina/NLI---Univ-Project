If it does so , that will be regarded as essential progress along the way .
As I say , I support Mr Eurlings ’ report .
Firstly , and as you yourself said , Europe needs the Lisbon strategy to become a reality .
We propose to you a five-year programme in which Europe’s development of the Lisbon strategy is placed within a time frame as specific as the one devised when we duly created the internal market in 1992 .
By doing things simultaneously , we achieve a far greater impact .
Fourthly , we need to strengthen gender equality in the work place .
If we act single-mindedly , we can actually do this .
Seventhly , we need a European Agency for Fundamental Rights .
Eighthly , we need a charter for services of general interest that can establish the principles governing citizens ’ rights in the modern welfare state .
Ninthly , Mr Barroso , we need a list of common principles governing ‘best practice ’ when it comes to the exchange of information about the integration of immigrants into our society .
We need the Commission to present an ambitious plan to the European Council by June 2005 to increase EU aid to developing countries , a plan to ensure that , in 2009 , we make an overall contribution of 0.5 % of GDP and that we establish a ‘road map’ to achieve 0.7 % in 2015 .
We need good speakers , but we also need practical action .
We shall assess your work on the basis of the practical action taken .
We are also all citizens with different views of the Constitution .
Nonetheless , all the EU bodies now propose that we who are opposed to the Constitution should pay subsidies to those who are in favour of it .
There are major subsidies to the European movement and to think-tanks that think alike , and now millions of euros for propaganda .
It is undemocratic , improper , in conflict with the principle of equality and , therefore , illegal .
I do not understand how the Commission ’s clever Swedish Vice-President can put her name to a communications strategy that will impose a particular view of the Constitution upon people .
Opinions should be left to a free press , the political organisations and parties , citizens ’ initiatives and interested parties .
A state is a tool for all the citizens .
It is up to the people to decide the political complexion of the laws , whether they are to be adopted in Brussels or by the national parliaments and whether they are good or bad .
Mrs Wallström can scarcely sell that project to the electorate .
With the figures from Parliament’s first reading , there is thus a suitable margin below the ceiling for administrative expenditure .
All in all , it has therefore been successfully ensured that the other institutions – that is to say , apart from Parliament and the Council , the Court of Justice , the Court of Auditors , the European Economic and Social Committee , the Committee of the Regions , the European Ombudsman and the European Data Protection Supervisor – are able to make the planned staff appointments resulting from enlargement , staffing reforms and the reform of financial administration .
In practice , the savings due to the lower salary increases will now be implemented with the help of an amending budget in the course of 2005 .
It was that agreement into which we entered with the Council .
So far , so good .
It is especially important , moreover , that we obtain financial gains through cooperation between the institutions .
We have seen the delays there have been in recruiting staff following enlargement , and I think it important that we closely follow up how these matters are proceeding so that we might see if there are likely to be problems .
I should like at this point to restrict the focus somewhat and also issue a challenge to Parliament’s leadership .
It makes good sense for us to make facilities available as long as , by doing so , we are not interfering with Parliament’s working arrangements .
It must be a decision that fits in with our work , but also one that is remunerative .
Parliament’s budget stands at 20 % of administrative expenditure and appears reasonable in relation to needs .
I would , however , emphasise – as I have done in the past – that in recent years we have been able to deploy major expenditure on paying for buildings under this 20 % budget , and we shall thus save on rent in the budgets for the next few years .
When all is said and done , there will be some room for manoeuvre in Parliament’s budget for 2005 , and I would therefore call upon Parliament’s leaders to look at the quality of the assistance we are given as MEPs , for example regarding translation and legal assistance .
With enlargement and increasing legislative activity , we need access to advice , as well as to studies , consultations and analyses .
The 2005 budget appropriates EUR 17.5 million to an increase in MEPs’ remuneration for the purpose of appointing staff .
The legislation on which we work is very often technically complicated environmental and commercial legislation , and we therefore require support in our work .
The amount concerned has been placed in reserve while we awaited a decision .
Finally , I should like to say thank you for your constructive cooperation on this budget procedure .
I would particularly thank Mrs Grybauskaite , our Commissioner , who was very active in bringing about a compromise on the budget .
I would also thank the Council’s negotiator , Mr Nicolaï , and the rapporteur , Mr Garriga Polledo , who I think have made fantastic contributions to
