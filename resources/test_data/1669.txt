The newly elected European Parliament will have many new powers and capabilities .
( Applause ) Madam President , 20 years ago socialism collapsed at the pan-European picnic on the Austro-Hungarian border .
It is , on the contrary , an honour for us - at least from the point of view of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance - to have you as President .
However , I would also like to mention the important contribution in terms of Polish culture that you can make to cooperation and cultural diversity in Europe .
That was and still is a real danger .
Prime Minister , you personally have done a good job and gained a great deal of respect .
And unfortunately , Mr Barroso , even though there is often talk about your strength , where was this strength during the times of weakness of this Council Presidency ?
You also need to deal with another institutional issue , namely that of how the next Commission will be appointed .
We could have already discussed everything with the candidate weeks ago to see whether he would receive a majority vote in this House on the basis of his proposals .
If we look at the picture today and draw a comparison with the game of Monopoly that we are all familiar with , the banks have been re-established , they have passed 'go ' and did not go to jail , they have taken hundreds of millions with public approval and then simply started the game again .
We are prepared to tussle with you over the new definition of the Lisbon strategy and to work with you on this .
The Chinese Government is extremely ill advised to talk only of terrorists , to claim that these people want to destroy the unity of the state and to say that outside forces like Al-Qaeda and others are behind this .
That is why , back in October 2008 , the Commission met with all the parties involved - including both the Member States and the social partners - as part of the CARS-21 process , to discuss a common way to manage the crisis .
I also welcome the fact that 10 % of the shares will remain in the hands of the employees .
In order to protect the workers affected , the EIB , Member States and the Commission have provided financial means so as to soften the social consequences in the sector .
Opel has had problems .
We have to jump in here and give people a chance .
Instead , the governments of the other Member States of the European Union whose production sites are affected by the GM crisis - in other words , the governments of Poland , Spain , Belgium , the United Kingdom and so on - should get together and consider , along with the Germans , how to make something out of this worst of situations and how it is possible to secure the future of the jobs of the affected people in the factories .
Brussels cannot just criticise Germany or other governments .
Overcapacities must be converted into new work methodically and with an equal division of burdens .
I have never before come across an example where positive feedback about trade negotiations has been forthcoming from the agricultural sector .
Or are such bilateral agreements merely a supplement to or expansion of the European Union 's free trade policy ?
In the countries of south-east Asia and , in particular , in the special economic zones , where people are exploited and employed without minimum social standards , textiles are being produced at dumping prices and then sold on the European market .
However , I believe , Mr Buzek , that you are taking over your office at a difficult time for the European Union .
This means that in the end , the opposite of nationalism , overcoming nationalism , the European ideal , means peace .
I also believe , Mr President , that everything which you said about the second major challenge facing us in the context of an international round of negotiations , that is , the challenge of the climate crisis , was correct .
Many friends are more dangerous than enemies .
It is about the question of whether you gain a majority - yes or no ?
Whichever tool we choose , Mr Barroso , I expect to hear one sentence from you .
We say that the political system , including the policies of the EU Commission , was responsible for promoting casino capitalism .
I think that you could , for example , by means of the employment policy guidelines .
Be bold !
We wish you , Mrs Ask , and the Commission , success here in the coming weeks .
You have our full support here .
That is why I voted for the joint motion for a resolution on the forest fires in the summer of 2009 .
A lot of people experience this area as a prison , where they have no contact with the outside world .
This law flies in the face of European values , which is why I was delighted that Commissioner Barrot responded on this back in July .
However , it is a pity that some Member States , through their promotion of the South Stream project , which is openly competing with Nabucco , have been undermining the policy of energy independence .
It is outrageous that Peking has once again made a political issue out of a purely humanitarian act by the Dalai Lama .
I have for years been genuinely concerned and outraged by the fact that , time and again , human rights activists involved with the situation in Chechnya are being murdered .
We must also acknowledge the fact that a person has been
