for energy consumption in other lands .
Prices of conventional forms of energy at the moment are too low compared to those of the new technologies , and for that reason we have to create incentives for their introduction .
Neither the goal of doubling the consumption of renewable energy by the year 2010 nor the Kyoto agreement will be implemented unless room is made for the new technologies in the production of energy .
In Finland we use renewables mainly in the form of wood , in its various forms , and peat , which has a substantial share of the market .
Harvesting and preparing the wood and the peat requires work .
Peat and wood consumption , therefore , at the same time promotes employment .
On the other hand , mass production requires highly developed technology .
Madam President , three large volcanoes have just erupted : one in Asia , one in Russia , and one in Latin America .
The problem is that capitalism , with its capital markets , creates instability and imbalance in the world .
International institutions issue erroneous advice when this situation occurs .
They give the same kind of advice to all countries , which are all different , and generally that advice is deflation , or , in the case of industrialised countries , cuts in social welfare .
We should be preventing the fire , or , in this case , the volcanic eruptions , from starting at all .
The third way is the outside lane .
Mr President , it is very important that environmental policy is integrated into agricultural policy , and that environmental policy is integrated into all policy in the European Union .
But we should be happy to have come this far .
Now the question arises as to how Member States will respond to what is , to my mind at least , a step forward : how shall we monitor it ?
And how should the matter be treated ?
Mr President , I think it is very important that both Commissioners are here at the same time , so that we can speak about regional policy and competition policy together , and speak too about regional aid and state aid .
We should be creating a situation where every citizen and business would at any moment in time be able to acquire information about how much state aid or regional aid has been granted to which project .
Thus , if a company receives aid it must remain in the region .
It must stay there for at least five years and ensure that jobs are preserved .
For that reason it is vital that we debate the issue of energy taxation , something the Commissioner mentioned earlier .
We must remember that the Treaty of Amsterdam makes provision for a situation where some countries can move forward more swiftly than others , if those others are not ready .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission has issued a communication on public procurement : it wishes to establish a legal framework , to simplify procedures , and bring a degree of flexibility to the market .
In addition , however , it is important to bear in mind the broader social objectives : principles of humanity , the demands of society and the working principles of the public sector , which are not always directly compatible with models of private enterprise .
He feels that it is necessary to harmonise the social principles of the Union with EU legislation .
In developing EU procurement legislation the regulations need to be tightened up , and we have to make methods of monitoring their enforcement more effective .
What if it were also that bidding for public procurement contracts is not compatible with other principles that apply in the public sector ?
I await the report promised by the Commission on the total impact of procurement .
Both the Commission communication and Mr Tappin 's report raise the issue of the need to make it easier for SMEs to access the public procurement market .
It is important as there appears to be a danger of cartels forming connected with bidding for procurement contracts .
We should also remember that local authorities , because of their democratic nature , generally have a better sense of morality than the business world .
Such conditions are worth noting , as cars and other kinds of machinery are frozen solid .
The Union has a strategy for acidification , and this proposal relates to legislation to limit the sulphur content of liquid fuel oils .
As we know , sulphur falls to the earth , acidifies the soil and does harm to nature .
It thus has many kinds of adverse effects .
This is undoubtedly to be seen as a step forward .
The problem remains , however , that the Council 's common position , which is a unanimous compromise , will mean this reduction in the sulphur content of light fuel oil will not take place until the start of 2008 , and that can hardly be regarded at this stage as a hugely radical move .
Then there is the very important question of how the sulphur content of heavy fuel oil should be limited .
The difference of opinion that still exists between the Council of Ministers and Parliament 's Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , when the common position is examined , lies in the fact that the Council is only prepared to apply a limit to the sulphur content of heavy fuel oil as from the start of 2003 .
There is a certain aspect of this report that is perhaps sometimes forgotten : Finland , Sweden and Austria , when they joined the Union , gained the right to maintain tighter environmental requirements over a four-year term , which ended at the end of last year
