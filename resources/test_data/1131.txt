is why research must help preserve this vanishing natural resource in those areas that still have clean water .
It is important for European research and competitiveness that the Framework Programme budget be as large as possible .
Only then can we be certain of enjoying high standards in the future in Europe .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mrs Rothe warmly for the excellent work she has done in preparing this report on future renewable energy sources .
There is a good argument both for using renewable energy and for the decentralized production of energy , particularly in the regions of the EU that are remote , sparsely populated and which have high unemployment .
Energy policy development should always take stock of local conditions .
This has not been emphasized sufficiently in Mrs Rothe 's report either .
Supporting renewable energy through taxation will be unavoidable if Member States wish to fulfil the goals set for the Union at the Kyoto climate conference .
In this way the Union 's energy policy can be more clearly based on renewable sources and not , for example , on the further building of nuclear power plants with the risks they entail .
EU dependence on imported energy is growing .
We see , however , a conflict between worthy aims and insufficient means .
That is that the increased use of biomasses is , above all else , a matter of agricultural policy and not energy policy .
I myself would prefer to have the heat from the sun and the heat from the earth .
Madam President , our group supports the general ideas contained in Mr Secchi 's report .
An example of this is that the meetings this high-level taxation group holds have an air of being top secret , and it is very hard to get any information on them , which is most certainly no longer the right attitude to take today .
We see that it may , in some areas , be a useful tool , but we clearly wish it to be known that we want a minimum level of taxation in the EU , for example , for corporation tax .
How then will we be able to preserve this European model ?
The report presents us with a splendid opportunity to discuss the weapons the Union will choose to combat harmful tax competition between Member States .
The higher overall labour costs are , the higher the unemployment rate generally is also .
The Union has quite rightly intervened in indirect taxation , for example by aiming at harmonization of VAT.
Tax havens can only be created in countries whose national economies are in good shape or with an undeveloped social security system .
They are able to compete with low taxation .
Tackling this problem is at least as important as intervening in harmful positive tax competition .
Furthermore , tax competition has a damaging effect on energy and environmental policy , for example .
For some reason , people imagine that companies that employ human beings are more solvent than , for example , companies that employ robots , since their tax bill is extortionate compared to that of others .
The burden of taxation therefore needs to be shifted away from the human labour force and towards activities with a greater ability to pay .
Currency dealing and speculation are regarded as more productive forms of business .
Thus , the Union must explore the possibilities of the ' Tobin Tax ' as quickly as possible and in the name of better employment policy .
Why do we allow black holes in the taxation system these days here in Europe ?
We have only recently had proof of how Pakistan and India , through smuggling , fraud , theft and bribery have obtained the means to manufacture a nuclear bomb .
The main problem is that nuclear plants produce spent fuel .
That is the end product , and there is nowhere to dump it .
That is why urgent measures are required of the Commission to enable the gradual construction of final nuclear waste sites .
The approved amendment to point 6 is a political signal to the Commission to consider separate legislation to guarantee that the above mentioned points are covered .
On many points the proposal will serve to clarify the rules , although it does not yet solve all the problems .
There is , unfortunately , a risk that Finland will put a stop to this good proposal - possibly together with Denmark .
The question now is which role does Finland want to have ?
Now would be just the right time to send a European Parliamentary delegation to East Timor .
It is also reasonable to insist that the European Union support the democratic movements in Indonesia and East Timor .
Mr President , the Commission has rightly proposed a ban on industrial fishing outside the Baltic Sea area .
Marine birds , for example , can get caught up as by-catches in nets with small mesh sizes .
In addition , fishing is important for sparsely-populated coastal areas .
In the Accession Treaty countries were permitted to fish herring for animal feed until the end of 1997 .
Although there are no problems as yet , fishing - and especially intensive fishing - must be monitored .
The principle of sustainability in fishing must be observed .
With reference to Mr Kofoed 's report , I wonder why the Commission gave its international recommendation to the members of the Baltic Fishing Commission so late that the deadline for filing a protest had already passed .
Madam President , I would like to thank Mrs Bonino for having successfully concluded a problematic agreement on the banning of drift-net fishing .
Secondly , it is very important to promote an increase in natural salmon for rivers in Northern Europe .
