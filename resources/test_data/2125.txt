subhuman primates today .
Madam President , I will start by saying that I do not belong to the cross-party group of animal rights extremists either by nature or by inclination , I have never been a vegetarian and I am not one of those people who likes to sleep with their dog on their bed .
Each speaker has explained his position calmly and resolutely , and , indeed , I do not even want to use all the time available to me for fear of repeating what has already been said .
The report 's proposals are certainly sound , the recommendations made by the Commissioner - although I feel she is a little overoptimistic - are certainly sound , but the important thing is for the legislation to be implemented , and so we need inspectors , we need monitoring , we need all possible endeavours to ensure that the directive is respected , even before we start to revise it .
It is therefore extremely important to limit the scope and legal procedures , and clearly delineate the legal procedures of this process , precisely in order to avoid delays being contrived and the possibility of re-entry .
As it is simply , I repeat , a technical working tool , it was neither discussed by the College nor submitted for its approval , and the College has therefore no political responsibility for its content .
That requires a responsible and humble approach , and it is with humility that I propose to follow Jean Monnet 's intuition in order to meet the great challenges of the future .
In short , it has three objectives : the Union must become more democratic , more effective and clearer .
Once it has confirmed the appointment of the President of the Commission , the Council , by common agreement with him or her , will designate the other members of the Commission .
Lastly , as I have often said in this House , the time has come to put Parliament on the same footing as every other democratically elected parliament , by reforming the way the Union is financed .
Our main proposals in this respect can be summed up in three points .
I believe that the proposal for a President of the Union , put forward by several quarters , creates more problems than it solves .
We therefore recommend maintaining the system of rotation for the Presidency of the European Council , the General Affairs Council and the Committee of Permanent Representatives .
What we propose is a new post of Secretary of the Union for Foreign Affairs .
The Secretary will be appointed jointly by the European Council and the President of the Commission , and will also be a Vice-President of the Commission .
The Council , or a group of Member States , may , however , ask the Secretary to present suitable proposals to the Council to achieve common objectives .
The current volume of directives , decisions and regulations that combine to form our body of legislation is possibly the biggest barrier citizens face in understanding the European institutions .
When the legislator decides to adopt laws at European level , I repeat , the Commission alone should have responsibility for their implementation .
The Convention that Parliament and I too wanted so keenly is providing our fellow citizens and the whole world with an analysis of all aspects of our institutions .
The new position of Secretary of the Union for Foreign Affairs would represent a strong Europe , able to set out its position in international bodies through a single representative .
Mr President , only if we proceed on this basis will we be able to conclude this process , at the end of 2003 , with a Constitution and a second , high quality , credible Treaty of Rome .
Why do I say that ?
The new constitutional engineering work can only be based on in-depth , responsible dialogue between the representatives of the European and national institutions .
The Commission 's proposal , outlined yesterday in Le Monde and today in this House , is reminiscent of the French model , with the Commission in the role of Mr Raffarin and the Council in the role of Mr Chirac.
However , there is no clear proposal on one fundamental point , namely the integration of the Charter of Fundamental Rights - its integration , not the inclusion of a reference to it - for there is no modern Constitution which does not enshrine human rights .
I will just make a few brief points , the first of which is addressed to Mr Bar√≥n Crespo .
I would like , first of all , to thank you for your enthusiastic support for our proposals , for your enthusiastic support for the Community method and for your understanding of the very simple fact that this is not a final proposal - it is neither the Commission 's initial nor its final proposal - it is a major step forward which will allow us to discuss the issues together .
.
Mr President , as of yesterday , train No 299 no longer exists : the glorious , legendary poor man 's Orient Express , which ran from Brussels-Midi through Luxembourg , France and Switzerland to Milan in Italy , has been withdrawn .
I urge you , Mr President , to make vigorous representations to the Belgian Government , calling for a reversal of this decision .
I call upon the European Parliament and its President to ask for more detailed information from the Italian Government .
Indeed , we advocate the subdivision - described by the rapporteur - of the European Union 's normative system into three parts : the constitutional , the legislative and the regulatory .
Our experience in this area has almost always been negative
