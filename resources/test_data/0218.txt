That is why I think that the Commission study is important and we await its results with great interest .
The Commission needs to pay particular attention to Mr Perry 's individual proposals if we are to take another step forward on the interconnected problems linked to the whole of the audiovisual sector .
Another conclusion on which we more or less agree is the dual role of the audiovisual media .
We need to realise here that the danger from the commercial deficit on the audiovisual media market in comparison with the corresponding American products is directly linked to the future of Europe .
In view of all this , the reform of the Television without Frontiers directive must be one of the most serious concerns of all three institutions of the European Union because , over and above clarifying disputed concepts , such as independent producers etc. , we need to guarantee the availability of digital options to a wide public and promote the cohesion of the policy of the audiovisual industry .
Namely that European culture is a fundamental component of the European economic and social model which is needed if the political venture of the European Union is to be completed .
We demonstrated during the preparation of this report and in the dialogue held in the Committee on Culture with all the honourable Members , and I must thank them for that , the central importance of creation and of creators as a basic source of the added value of cultural products .
European citizens consume millions of copies of disks and books and buy millions of tickets to the cinema and concerts every year .
In these ways they select , cultivate and promote one form or another of art and culture , different aesthetics and quality , in close dependency on education and their personal development .
It is a complex cultural process which characterises the daily life of citizens and we should not ignore the broad political importance and weight which it has .
Creators ' works must overcome a number of obstacles , such as problems in connection with distribution and promotion and extensive piracy , in order to find a way of reaching the European public .
First , the need for a definition of cultural industries and the sectors they include .
We are calling for it to concentrate on cultural , economic , legal , technological and educational aspects , to include employment , intellectual property , the competitiveness network , new products and exports .
Mr President , I should like to thank our rapporteur for the serious work she has done ; however , I cannot agree with her on the approach which she has opted to take .
Under these conditions , approaching culture in terms of the industry , the market and added value , as if we were talking about cars or oranges , is very dangerous .
Even piracy is condemned not as theft of intellectual work , but because it deprives these industries of vast revenues , impacting on future investment .
Finally , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to draw your attention to the amendments proposed by our political group , in a bid to mitigate somewhat the consequences of the report .
Apart from creating wealth and jobs , the cultural industries , by their very nature , promote initiative and innovation , which are valuable factors for the competitiveness of the European economy .
They cannot forgive the determination of the Cuban people , as expressed on a daily basis with their fighting unity , to defend their socialist homeland to the last .
( EL ) The European PASOK group decided to vote against the entire motion , considering that the positions on the ban on women entering Mount Athos , conscientious objectors and the right of Muslims to mosques and cemeteries are unjust , unacceptable and , at the very least , demonstrate ignorance for the following reasons : 1 .
As far as Muslim mosques are concerned , it is a known fact that there are currently 350 mosques and 250 Muslim cemeteries , while the procedure to found an Islamic centre and mosques in Paiania in Attica is advancing . 4 .
( EL ) 11 September provided an opportunity to speed up measures to apply the most anti-grass roots choices of the monopolies .
It was followed by a sweeping charge against human rights and personal freedoms in the ?U.
A typical example is that over fourteen thousand people died from the heatwave in the France of ? respect for human rights .
In the name of the fight against terrorism , electronic records on citizens under the Schengen system prevail , personal data are being channelled to the USA , mass 'repatriation ' of immigrants is multiplying .
Our disagreement is based on the fact that , irrespective of intentions , legal and institutional frameworks and restrictive mechanisms , the private sector is being activated on the basis of the profit criterion , automatically converting a social resource into a commodity with all that implies , especially for poor nations .
The peoples of Europe are fighting for peace against imperialist military intervention , as in Yugoslavia , Afghanistan and Iraq , and against cooperation with and support for Israel in its bellicose strategy of violation of the rights of the Palestinians , and they will overturn with their fight the militarisation of Europe which will strengthen imperialism against the peoples even more .
The only thing those conducting the prosecution and those hiding behind them have managed to do is to destroy the health of President Milosevic in a bid , perhaps , to exterminate him physically .
We are convinced that , however much the imperialists try to justify their crimes in Yugoslavia by distorting the truth , they will not succeed .
It would appear that workers in the countries of the European
