That might well mean a cut in income for individual farmers , in other words , individual farmers will have to pay for the crisis .
They used the legally approved feed in good faith , although it turned out to be toxic .
The aims of an electronic Europe and civil society will thus not be achieved without network services helping people to establish connections with one another and get organised accordingly .
In this way a person could function in the networked society and we would not be creating an elite network .
As much as EUR 170 billion are estimated to have gone into radio spectrum auctions .
Apart from anything else , the timing was unfortunate .
Investors have begun to shun the industry and the production of the next generation of networks , equipment and services is slowing down .
The framework directive is a move towards the regulation of all telecommunications networks and services .
On the contrary , the same EU provisions have been interpreted in very many different ways and in many areas exorbitantly high charges have been maintained .
Genuine competition has been prevented through many forms of trickery .
Certain big players in the industry are all for competition in other sectors , but are in truth against it in their own .
At the same time , I propose an increase in transparency .
The Commission must act when a Member State is not complying with common telecommunications legislation .
As the auction principle could also extend to other resources caught in a bottleneck and new generations of mobile phone networks , I would ask the Commission now to investigate the situation comprehensively for Parliament regarding the effect of auctions on companies and consumers .
Another essential sector is the definition of significant market player .
A significant market player is now also one that has the continued ability to limit other operators ' contacts with users .
What a paradox !
The first version of the report was used as a chance for them to get on their hobbyhorse and oppose nuclear energy .
What is remarkable is that there was no mention , whatsoever , in the report of the Commission ' s action programme , which contains many sensible initiatives .
The transport of radioactive material is in compliance with the regulations of the International Atomic Energy Agency .
The risks are considered to be small and , thanks to the stringent regulations in force , accidents have been avoided for almost half a century .
I urge everyone to keep to the facts .
If the nuclear power plants in France were closed down right now , there would be a rush in this Chamber to look for candles .
We could , therefore , say that aid does not beget healthy competition in the shipbuilding industry either .
We therefore have to avoid a situation that would lead to new problems within the Union .
Commissioner Monti , what are you doing , besides using the opportunities presented under the sixth framework programme , with regard to this work , acutely serious and extremely important as it is to us all , in this highly technical , modern area ?
This can now be regarded as a precedent , and this obviously leads to the question as to how then all the other ball games and individual sports will be treated in the future , and how the rules that apply to them might possibly change , as each sport is obviously different and limits on age and training vary greatly between them .
Can this now be regarded as setting a precedent for all of them ?
And thirdly , can we in future also apply our own rules to sports events that are purely national and are not played or enjoyed anywhere else except in just the one Member State , or are we to await this precedent ?
At the same time , it shows how large a part the Member States play in administering the EU budget , as they use up 80 % of all expenditure .
In my opinion , it would be important in the fight against fraud to bear in mind certain principles .
Administration has to be simplified ; there is an end to how much increased bureaucracy and supervision will improve the way funds are spent .
Personal responsibility has to be increased - in this respect , the Commission ' s reform has been vital - and cooperation between the European Union and the Member States must be improved : that , too , will be vital in the future .
Mr President , it is the custom to start with thanks and I , as rapporteur , have every reason to do that now .
Furthermore , the representatives of the Council - I refer to both those of France and Sweden - have been encouraging and well-informed about the matter .
This is a report which is significant , not just for the individual citizen , but also for the Community ' s environmental policy .
I think that one of the most important factors in my own report is first the obligation to establish registers .
It is a precondition of the viability of this directive .
I noted with satisfaction that Mr Cashman , in his own report on transparency , calls for exactly the same thing .
Another clarification regarding the refusal to disclose information concerns the exceptions in Article 4( 2 ) .
The adverse effects of emissions do not depend on the nature of the work that produced them ; from the point of view of public health and safety , it makes no difference whether the source is a public or commercial one .
In my study of the directive it hit me that no comprehensive harmonisation of emission measurement procedures had been called for in
