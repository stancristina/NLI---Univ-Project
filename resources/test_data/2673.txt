, basically a sound agreement .
That would jeopardise the public 's understanding of these agreements .
Moreover , this agreement comes at a good time .
It is therefore particularly welcome that a large number of countries have subscribed to this agreement .
There are many examples of challenges which are best resolved by the international community : green taxes and duties , eco-labelling , trade instruments with an environmental aim , facilitating market access for the developing countries , protecting intellectual property rights and the fight against technical barriers to trade .
We must therefore work together to see that the democratic control over the WTO is as strict as that applied to the EU.
That is our task for the future .
What surprises me so much , Mr Santer , is how you can talk about an independent office .
How can there be any talk of an independent office when it will still be the Commission that decides how the investigations are followed up ?
Is it not more a question of people wanting to shed responsibility and trying to run away from the responsibilities which they have in connection with precisely the kind of things we have been dealing with here recently ?
The questions which the Commission has still not dealt with are all ones which only affect the accounts indirectly , or not at all .
Everyone in the Committee on Budgetary Control agrees that the Commission has acted in a way that is very much open to criticism , but the point now is to join together in finding constructive solutions to the problems that have been revealed .
At worst , rejecting the accounts now may mean that good Commissioners like Mr Liikanen , who is the first Commissioner ever to have shown some interest in clearing things up , will be forced to resign .
In such a case , however , I would like to see one or two others go as well .
I would just mention the introduction of the euro , the work on enlarging the EU to include the new applicant countries and the forthcoming elections to our own institution , and perhaps that is why this joker is being played here - there are some people who want to make a name for themselves in an election campaign at home , and this issue is being used for that purpose .
However , this does not mean that the Commission is now being given a permanent carte blanche for all the years to come .
I would advise the Commission to be on its mettle in the future .
The Commission has shown the will to do this , for which I think it should be rewarded , and so everyone else should stop using this for their own personal election campaigns .
Mr President , the question of whether or not to grant discharge is one that turns on Parliament 's role as an authority which exercises budgetary control .
Our work has not been particularly encouraging in the last nine months , when I think of how we have had to drag information out of the Commission and how we have had to fight for the slightest changes .
The worst thing , to my mind , has been the attempts to disclaim responsibility for various mistakes and scandals .
It has also been disappointing that , although we have repeatedly given new deadlines , there are a great many things which have not been followed up by the Commission .
My aim is to ensure that the problems are resolved , that the EU is adapted to new tasks , to the major challenges that are facing us , and that the EU is prepared for and copes with its enlargement to include the countries of Central and Eastern Europe .
The point is therefore for us to live up to our responsibility and do what we can to bring about a sound and effective administration .
However , there are still some serious outstanding problems and an ineffective administration .
There are the problems with staff policy , and there is a lack of internal procedures where irregularities and corruption are suspected .
Some people have talked about the consequences of refusing to grant discharge .
If we can now accept what it takes for us to refuse discharge for a second time , and ultimately we will find it hard to explain to our voters how it fits in with our responsibility to...

Thank you , Mr President , for giving me the chance to correct one or two misunderstandings .
I would like to say that the situation in the Socialist Group is that if someone is chosen as a coordinator , they look after the interests of the group and their colleagues , not their own personal interests .
I would like to say that I am very disappointed that another group is attacking us in such a personal way .
That is democracy , and anything else is not !
Mr President , in the past , Mr President of the Commission , you have promised fewer rules but better prepared ones in return , and I am very pleased with that .
I simply do not have the chance to see if you meant to keep your promises .
Amendments to existing directives , plans for green papers , action programmes and important communications are not in fact included in the Commission 's statement .
When a government is presenting its list of legislation , one might perhaps accept this state of affairs : after all , the voters can decide to replace the government at the next elections , if they are dissatisfied with what it delivers
