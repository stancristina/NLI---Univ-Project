The document is very important because it restores the balance in a situation that seems to favour centralised , concentrated energy production .
Renewable energies have been remarkably neglected .
In particular , I should like to highlight the contribution of biomass ; in gas conversion processes it can produce hydrogen directly , and we all know how important that is .
The role of the European Union is decisive , not least to spur on national policies and to put Community directives into practice : only by making a coordinated effort across the continent can Europe become a credible player in global energy policies .     The next item is the statement by the Commission on the textile industry .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the best thing to do concerning our trade relations with China and Asian markets in general is to desist from an unequal contest that will cause irreparable damage to European industry : the textile industry today , manufacturing tomorrow , then the car industry , technology and so on .
This is the aim , Mr President , of the two amendments tabled by over 40 Members on which voting will take place this morning .
This is the right moment to say that damage to fair competition is sometimes inflicted by unscrupulous European entrepreneurs who , thinking solely of their own short-term profit , infringe a rule by promoting the unlawful importation and distribution in Europe of counterfeit or dangerous goods .
It is a sort of reactionary utopia to think that one can curtail the free movement of men and women with the barbed wire separating two continents .
It is deplorable that the Council is talking today about enhanced cooperation with Libya when it should be demanding that Libya ratify the Geneva Convention .
We were able to ascertain – as confirmed by an investigative report by the biggest Italian weekly paper – that human rights are being systematically violated on Lampedusa .
That is what the gentlemen of the left ought to ascertain , instead of pretending to be unaware of what the Zapatero government is doing , when in fact it is firing on illegal immigrants .     . – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , since I now know him well , I am willing to understand Mr Catania’s exaggerations , emphases and fantasies – which are all pessimistic , naturally .
For that reason , and this is my final point , we should give our warm thanks to those who work at the Lampedusa centre – civilians , the forces of law and order , the police , the , religious workers and volunteers – for the humaneness and professionalism they display and the sacrifices they make every day .
Currently there is no EU policy on immigration and there are countries which are not capable of tackling the problem by themselves .
We must set up a common immigration policy – Mr President , I am just finishing – so that , in addition to human tragedies , in addition to the needy , hungry people who need work , other aspects are also borne in mind , such as those who operate boats to carry illegal immigrants , traffickers in human beings and above all the terrorists who may benefit from these situations to infiltrate Europe .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in all honesty we expected more from the Council’s statement .
We await some answers .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I might just as well say that we need a policy at the European level and stop there , since we have already said everything .
To stop the invasion we need to remove the illusion that it is possible to enter Europe illegally and either to remain illegally or even to have one’s situation regularised .
Europe has a duty to take responsibility , politically and economically , for what happens along the length of the shores of the Mediterranean , because they represent the external border of the south of the Union .
The Zapatero government was not capable of dealing with the situation , and was not able to tackle an emergency while respecting the human rights of the immigrants who were pressing at the borders .
We do not want to see any repetitions of the scenes that have been shown on television in recent days : so many innocent victims , killed through a total inability to tackle the emergency and to know how to combine security and respect for human lives .
We therefore fully support the resolution by the board of governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency , which mandated its Director General , Dr El Baradei – who has since been deservedly awarded the Nobel Prize for peace – to continue to pursue the path of negotiation .
I would like to encourage the Commission and the Council to continue the policy of dialogue , and never to separate human rights issues from trade agreements with Iran .     Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , what we are to decide on tomorrow is , in my opinion , a resolution of openness and dialogue ; it represents a Europe that believes in politics as the art of combining vision and reality .
A pensioner called from Genoa who started by saying that she had a widow’s survivor’s pension .
Not only should the quantity of aid be increased – here I agree with Commissioner Michel – but far greater efficiency also needs to be achieved .
In my view this is another example of how we often concentrate on particular issues that we then abandon .
As we have seen , debt cancellation is essential , though for the debtor countries it has been in reality only a first step .
This is therefore another
