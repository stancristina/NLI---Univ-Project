, with the addition of amendment 9 , will receive the full support of the Group of the Party of European Socialists .
The European Parliament has included in the 1997 budget an item for cooperation with the People 's Republic of China : it voted on it at first and second readings in 1997 ; it voted on it again on the first reading for the 1998 budget .
From the bloody suppression of entire peoples , starting with the Ogoni , to assassinations , arbitrary arrests , torture , the disappearance of any political opponents , and the aberrant measures taken against the Nobel Prize winner Wole Soyinke .
The National Assembly , that had been elected at the elections on 16 March 1996 , was dissolved and all authority was concentrated on the military junta in power .
If there is a framework of initiatives already drawn up , already consolidated , I would like to ask the Commission , and not just for myself , to send us this framework of programmes and initiatives ; a reciprocal undertaking could be made by Parliament and the Commission because , along with the national initiatives for celebrating the anniversary ( I again refer to paragraph 11 ) , there could be cooperative and positive inter-institutional participation between the Commission , Council and Parliament .
The second aspect I wish to emphasize is that of efficacy .
I personally agree that it is good to strengthen an interinstitutional group , but my personal opinion is that Parliament is not a managerial body , that management falls to the Commission , that others are responsible for managing the policies and that we have the task of directing and controlling .
For example , they asked us what the relationship is between bureaucratic administrative expenses and expenses going directly to the execution of a project .
As Mrs Lenz reminded the House , the first point relates to the requirement or rather the need , both to restate and to demand a more important role for human rights , because this is an area in which the European Union is a credit to the citizens of Europe .
The other question is , of course , the question of resources .
Madam President , the political systems are all the more democratic and pluralist as their political institutions become more effective and their legal systems more independent .
In addition to the managerial problems of aid for the sector , the practice of policies actually aimed at the protection of human rights seems lame to us .
According to the Commission 's draft regulation , only products with proteins checked and analyzed with the current methods of analysis will necessarily be labelled as genetically modified soya - or maize-based products .
We can add these uncertainties to the others surrounding the food world , we can once again raise the problem of BSE , as well as the recent questions on extra virgin olive oil , and no-one will ever know how much is virgin !
So we have to ask ourselves : how have we reached this situation ?
But if we leave the railways as they are , we will lose credibility .
I am thinking of the 50 thousand killed in road accidents , the 7 , 800 killed in Italy every year - again in road accidents - and the serious problems of atmospheric pollution .
Only in this way can the railway system be revitalized .
There may also be the risk of this slot being transferred to third countries , and therefore the risk of a real marketing of slots on aircraft that are basically authorized and are polluting and also noisy .
Ten years ago , we did not know what it was .
Over the last three years , the American companies have merged into just three groups of worldwide dimensions , while the European consolidation process is slow .
It then examines the foreseeable consequences of the introduction of the euro on the markets ; the problems it raises for the EU 's exchange policy ; the prospects it opens for a new phase of international monetary cooperation ; and the specific problem of the use of dollar reserves that may be considered surplus .
Naturally , the stability of the exchange rate depends on American monetary policy and unforeseeable external shocks .
The report suggests that the European Union should adopt a political initiative to this effect .
And so the basic subject we have before us is that of the future system of economic governance for the European Union in economic and monetary union .
I believe that the decisions taken at the recent Luxembourg Summit , generally in favour of the formation of the socalled Eurocouncil , are going in the right direction and summarize the requirement for a non-monetary government authority for the economy , which to a certain extent matches the monetary government of the European Central Bank .
It has been recalled by other colleagues that it will be in the banks that the citizens will discover the euro , but particularly in the commercial distribution system .
What we want to avoid - and indeed must avoid - is that the final cost of introducing the single currency should fall on the consumer alone .
For this reason , the draft New Transatlantic Agenda , enriched by Mrs Mann 's report , broadly indicates and covers the many sectors in which cooperation needs to be intensified .
The Souchet report should be highly commended for its criticism of some egregious cases of American unilateralism in many fields that are already regulated by international agreements or where cooperation with other partners should have been the order of the day .
As rapporteur on the health monitoring action programme which ended last year , I noted the Council 's hard and short-sighted position on that occasion too .
