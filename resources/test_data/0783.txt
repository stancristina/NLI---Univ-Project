with the programmes under Regulation (EC ) No 1257/99 , consolidate the second pillar of the CAP even more effectively and produce the best possible benefits for the whole of the countryside .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like firstly to thank Mr Procacci for his report .
We will obviously do this and will also forward a report to you on it .
I must add , however , that cooperation between our action groups and similar groups in third countries went too far for the Member States .
( Applause )
For that and for the letter to the Federal Chancellor of the Republic of Austria which you mentioned , we expressly respect , acknowledge and support you .
( Applause ) The Commission has an important role to play here by getting a coordinated policy under way with the nation states to reduce taxes so that entrepreneurship pays .
Nonetheless , I agree with you , Mr President of the Commission , that many more steps to strengthen the European Union will be needed in the future because the European Union is not strong enough either to master the huge , inevitable task of enlargement or to control current and potential movements which , to put it mildly , have an ambivalent attitude towards European values of democracy and tolerance and the desire to integrate all the people on our continent .
In this sense , the USA is not only our partner ; it is also our competitor ; not our opponent , our competitor and we must fight to see which of us offers our citizens the best model .
Our citizens do not need any new institutions and certainly no new mixing of powers .
You have excellent Commissioners for both issues in Mrs Palacio and Mr Barnier , yet still you attach too little importance to these areas .
Unfortunately , it does not give the impression of being a real political strategy on the part of the Commission .
Mr Prodi , what can I say ; what is there that is new ?
Where it falls short , what is missing , is transposition in the Member States and monitoring .
Please , Mr Prodi , stand by your word and implement your promises .
That makes it a question of health , not just approximating laws , which is why we in the Committee on Agriculture take the view that the legal base - Article 37 - is not admissible here and that the Commission should submit its proposal to us on the basis of Article 152 , that is to say with codecision by Parliament .
Mr President , Commissioner , does regulating additives in feedingstuffs come under competition or consumer policy ?
A clear declaration on feedingstuffs will allow double freedom of choice , both for the party using the feedingstuff and the subsequent consumer .
The most important amendment to the Commission proposal is the inclusion , as recommended by the rapporteur , of genetically-modified organisms in the directive on additives , taking the compromise negotiated between Parliament and the Commission on authorisation for GMOs outside the scope of the release directive as the starting point .
Mr President , we have said in this House time and again since the BSE crisis that feedingstuffs are one of the first and most important factors in safe food production and in consumer health and protection .
The rapporteur has done just that and that is a good sign .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it was and always will be one of life ' s mysteries , one of the unsolved riddles of the follow-up to the BSE crisis , that we still have no Community rules for the control of scrapie in sheep.
But the tests available now are perfectly able to guarantee security in consumer health policy , albeit not for every individual animal .
Although we did not have a very positive exchange on Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf ' s report earlier on and will certainly have to agree to disagree , things may be different with this report .
Finally , just one more brief comment , Mr Byrne .
Animals are bought throughout Europe and transported over the entire continent .
You see , there are numerous matters of concern here and they are all very different .
I also extend my special thanks to our rapporteur , Mrs Lienemann , for all her work and her cooperative attitude , even if we have agreed to differ on certain points .
Merely pulling proposals out of the air is not enough .
Secondly , there is compulsory cooperation .
Mr President , Commissioner , you are right , Commissioner , to bring pressure to bear on those Member States who have failed to transpose the flora and fauna directive , and that includes the Member State I come from .
As a result , they have a low level of social protection or none whatsoever , for paid employment serves as the basis for this according to systems currently in force .
Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur .
This would directly affect the individual ' s right to equality of opportunity with regard to access to education .
It was erroneously included in today ' s agenda .
Votes are often taken in the most diverse committees , as well as here in plenary sitting , which in itself is not coherent and does not accord with the tenets of development policy .
In plying this trade , not only do the industrialised countries , in conjunction with the ruling castes in many ACP countries , stand to make huge profits , but a vicious circle is also set in train that we ought not to forget .
There is a second issue I would like to raise .
