of the resources of the High Commissioner for Human Rights is also good .
Hence , I would also ask the Commission and the Council what Europe is doing to remedy this fault .
International law should not be violated .     – Mr President , I had asked the Commission and the Council for their opinion on when Parliament can expect the representatives of Commission and Council to be combined in New York and at the other sites of the United Nations , in order to achieve better coherence in the Union’s representation at the United Nations .
Our repertoire of diplomatic protests has been far from exhausted .
I think it would be contradictory if the Commission were to cut the funding for India instead of increasing it ; it would be incongruous , somehow .
The report has many positive aspects .
We have achieved market penetration and thus made an important contribution to the fight against climate change .
The right to vote does exist , and seats in the Kosovan Parliament are reserved for minorities .
Yet people are indifferent , unmoved .
Regarding the first crisis we have just seen with safeguard measures , Commissioner , I would like to ask you something on behalf of my Group .
We are faced with the fact that world trade is no longer what we used to imagine it would be in the future .
They are the ones that are suffering the most .
This House’s left-wing Members in particular are calling for the market to be sealed off again .
The trade conflict with China has made us all very much aware of this .
An orderly withdrawal of course needs alternatives for those employed in these sectors .
Requiring them to work with Chinese firms is clearly against the spirit of the WTO .
China also , however , offers a great opportunity for creating new jobs in Europe .     Mr President , the subject is ‘Prospects for Trade Relations ’ and Mrs Lucas began by asking for support for her report .
It is the result of an open , unprotected market economy with free competition .
We cannot have a situation where we open our markets while our firms are faced with problems over there .
We are an export-oriented economic unit , and we Europeans need the Chinese market .
The announcement of local elections for April 2006 is a positive sign .
A tremendous amount of money is going to Serbia .
The summit at which the European Social Model is to be considered is now only a few days away .
It is for that reason that we opted for this all-embracing title and are inclined to stick with it .     .
That will involve not only a consistent policy on return but also the conclusion by the EU of readmission agreements with countries of origin and of transit .
We have known all this ever since the 1970s , ever since the reports by Edward Heath , Willy Brandt and others , in which all of this is to be found .
My group sees de-escalation as being achievable , but not – as we have learned from Iraq – by invoking the Security Council .
Along with the ever-increasing flow of reports of executions of juveniles under the age of 18 and of others being sentenced to death , there is also the fact that Akbar Gandji , having been arrested over five years ago , is still in jail and is in a critical condition .
By the same token , even the best aid programmes will be of no use if we do not help people there to help themselves , or if we fail to embed democracy and the rule of law there in such a manner that they are not fragile plants but can put down strong roots ; what matters is that we should enable Africans to have a hand in shaping their own destiny and to take responsibility for how they do that .
Like me , Mrs Gomes saw elderly people queuing up for hours on end without food or water and then casting their votes with broad grins .
That , though , is not what they are for .
No real initiative is in sight , unfortunately .     .
On the other hand , though , it also emphasises these children’s right to learn their own mother tongue , and in doing so it is in line with the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which stipulates both the right to education and training and the right to one’s own cultural , religious and linguistic identity .
Mr President , we are about to discuss something wonderful – the circus .
Can you explain to me how I am meant to demonstrate that when I want to bring in a star performer from Ukraine or China to perform in a circus in Europe ?
We also have to think through the issues around the education and training of children and come to common solutions .
Urban and rural policy are dependent on each other ; it is for that reason that they may not , in any one territory , be considered in isolation , even though there are extreme differences between rural and urban zones in the ten new Member States .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , our group gives this own-initiative report a warm welcome and is grateful for the good cooperation .
We know that 80 % of people live in conurbations , that more and more people are moving to towns and cities , and that the problems associated with that are becoming more acute .
I oppose nuclear power as a matter of principle , but the agreement between Iran and the EU , as put before us , was a sham and could only been seen as escalating the dispute .
