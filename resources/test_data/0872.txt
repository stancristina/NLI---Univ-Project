Mind you , Baroness Ludford 's speech suggests to me that there might be some form of political euthanasia which I would support .
Madam President , I rise following Mrs Hautala 's statement about Mrs Lucas being imprisoned on her way to the part-session here today .
It seems strange to me that she was imprisoned on her way here because she represents the South East of England and was arrested five or six hundred miles further north .
Maybe , instead of telling the UK Government whom they can arrest and why , the parliamentary authorities could send her a map of the UK and some advice from our travel services as well .
Madam President , being consistent and on the same matter I wish to point out that the British Government is absolutely even-handed in its arrest policy .
It also arrested a couple of members of the House of Commons , a few members of the Scottish Executive and various others who were actually breaking the law , which is generally the reason you get arrested in the United Kingdom .
We were according equal rights to Euro-parliamentarians by arresting them along with all the others .
May they be kept locked up for a suitable period of time to deter them from being so stupid in the future !
Madam President , would you , as President of our Parliament , consider sending a message of congratulations to Ellen MacArthur , my constituent from Derbyshire who came second in the round the world yacht race ?
I know that the race was won by a compatriot of yours - a Frenchman .
He was gallant and kind in his congratulations .
If you , on our behalf , could congratulate them both , I and many others would be very grateful .
Request for waiver of Mr Ribeiro e Castro 's immunity Mr President , I thank the rapporteur in his absence and Mrs Langenhagen for her speech .
Mrs Langenhagen has painted a very bleak picture of the state of cod in the Irish Sea .
The Irish Sea , as Mrs Langenhagen has said , is an example to us all of how a stock , if not managed correctly , can be decimated .
In just six years the amount of cod caught in the Irish Sea has halved .
In 1993 , 11 000 tonnes of cod was caught and in 1999 , 5 500 tonnes were caught .
This regulation for 2001 is necessary , however painful , if there is to be a cod fisheries at all in the Irish Sea .
It is an example to other areas as well .
A similar situation has arisen in the North Sea .
The cod stocks have declined so much that there has been a reduction of half in the total allowable catch and a new cod recovery programme introduced .
Vast stretches of the North Sea have been protected whilst the spawning season gets under way .
However , another consequence of the ban in cod fisheries over the next few months has been that the other areas where there is no ban are beginning to worry .
For example , in the Western Isles fishermen are concerned that because of the cod ban in the North Sea - and to some extent in the Irish Sea - cod stocks off the Butt of Lewis and south of Barra will be adversely effected .
After years of sustainable fisheries in these waters people fear that the adverse effect of these protective measures will be a decimation of their own stocks .
These fears can only be compounded when just last week in Mallaig , with the opening of the scallop beds , a dramatic increase in boats could be witnessed , which would otherwise have been fishing for the banned species .
We have to think about the adverse effects on other fisheries when protective measures are introduced .
It is somewhat ironic that in protecting fish stocks in one area we are inadvertently destroying stocks in another area .
In conclusion , the reform of the common fisheries policy and the launch of the Green Paper in March are critical to stock preservation and to the fishing industry .
We have to get the balance right between sustainability and a successful industry on the other hand .
The reform of the common fisheries policy , I believe , is an opportunity .
We must make sure that we get the reforms right .
I thank the rapporteur in his absence .
Mr President , in his report on the Irish Sea fishery Mr Nicholson recognises that this area has the dubious honour of pioneering the use of emergency measures to arrest the decline in cod stocks .
But in the North Sea , too , we are subject to emergency measures this year , necessary measures aimed at maximum protection of cod during the spawning period between now and the end of April .
Why is it then that , after so many years of a common fisheries policy whose principal intention is to conserve stocks , we have to resort to emergency measures in the Irish and North Sea cod areas ?
While accepting the need for these short-term measures , we must also learn from past mistakes and prepare sensible long-term management proposals to try to deal with these situations .
The technical measures which have been pioneered in areas like Scotland must be built on and improved and extended to all areas of fishery .
Appropriate action must be taken to prevent the displacement of effort leading to damage in other areas and to other stocks .
The impact of industrial fishery must be properly assessed , in terms both of its allowable white fish by-catch , and of its effect on the whole marine food chain .
Clearly a significant downturn in
