The other point was extraordinary bonuses .
I still find it extraordinary that the Bank whose primary objective is price stability saw its way to paying some staff the equivalent of a 38 % bonus .
The excuse is that they had worked a lot in the past - worked a lot of overtime - put a lot of work in - and that some of these staff were being paid only 9 % over a period of years and this was almost like catch-up pay .
But that is just shoddy management and really should not occur in a Bank like this .
As to my tactics , I was not really sure what I should do .
As someone who is not a great fan of the European single currency and certainly not his country 's entry into it , I had a dilemma with this report .
Whilst I would like to demand that the ECB take note of what the Court of Auditors has said , I could have used this report to attack the ECB and got great headlines for myself back home , but that was not the role of the rapporteur .
So I went to the ECB and asked for a meeting .
They kindly took me to Frankfurt , and I was told that they had changed their bonus policy , that they had understood the problems in project management , and so my report is , if not actually nice , then enhanced by this meeting with the ECB.
At my meeting with the ECB , I was told that it had solved its problems especially relating to the bonus and this would not happen again and it would send a letter to the Committee detailing its current bonus policy .
As it transpires , this letter has never turned up , and that is a great shame because the European Central Bank should not really fear criticism from this institution .
We are simply doing our job .
When problems occur , and they always will , it should not be the job of the ECB to paper over the cracks and pull down the shutters .
It should deal with the problems and tell the EU and its public how it has dealt with them and not have a panic attack over how it communicates these things .
As my speech has suggested , the report could easily have been a lot stronger , and the ECB has got off fairly lightly this year .
If similar or more problems occur next year , they might find such a report a bit tougher , unless they choose to actually open up , have a dialogue with our Committee , become more transparent and talk to all of us in this Parliament .
Mr President , I wish to begin by just reminding the House of a few statistics .
There are at least 16 million businesses within the EU , 99.9 % of them are micro to medium-sized .
There are 100 million people working in the EU in the private sector and , of these , 32 million people work in micro-businesses , which is businesses of less than 10 people ; 33 million people work in small to medium enterprises , with less than 249 people .
So a total of 65 million workers in the EU are in the small and medium sector , which shows that it is very important for us to be discussing the growth of such a sector .
In particular , it is absolutely right that this specific initiative - growth and employment - should be discussed within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , although it is clearly also of interest to other committees .
This particular report is concerned with funding programmes , which was an important initiative from this Parliament a few years ago .
But it is worth saying straight away , as confirmed at the Lisbon Summit , that the issue of the development of SMEs is not just a matter of funding .
It is also very important that all of us secure the right climate for enterprise , with less red tape and less bureaucracy , to encourage SMEs and risk-takers to actually consider taking out risk capital in the first place . 1999 was the first full year of this particular set of initiatives and , therefore , as a start-up phase it should have been relatively straightforward to report upon this without being too controversial .
However , there are some controversial elements in the report , essentially because of the Commission timetable in issuing its report .
I have annexed the detailed timetable to the report .
It shows that whereas the initial draft proposal from the Commission came out in November/December 1999 , it literally took a full five months before the report came before Parliament .
Then there was a further delay within Parliament , because we are not perfect in that respect either .
It took over a month to allocate it to a rapporteur and then , because of the summer recess , it was not possible to programme the internal debate and discussion until October and November .
Despite this long delay , there was further incompetence , dare I say , within the Secretariat because the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy under Mrs Flesch as the rapporteur had produced some very useful amendments to the report which only came to the Committee on Employment after we had voted on the report .
So that again was not exactly impressive .
I have agreed with Mrs Flesch that amendments from the committee today have my full support to go through unchallenged , as there are a number
