shipping companies can only be expected to discover obviously forged documents and people who lack any travel documents whatsoever .
Some of the contributions during the debate , such as the contributions from Mrs Terrón i Cusí and Baroness Ludford , dealt with the continued work .
I also reported on the status of the work in respect of some of the directives that are relevant .
We have also come a long way in respect of launching the Eurodac system .
However , we look forward to being able to commence work on this directive as well .
The implementation work is still in its initial stages , but we are moving forward and naturally we want to make decisions as quickly as possible .
All police work involves violating the integrity of those who are suspected of a crime .
This applies , for example , to that which Mr Gahrton mentioned - namely the SIS system , which is there for wanted persons .
It contains information on persons who are wanted , whether they are armed , their descriptions and other things such as information on stolen vehicles .
There is thus no such sensitive information and it is an incredibly important instrument if we are to be able to combat international criminality .
As regards the matter addressed by Mr Pirker - drugs criminality - I agree that it is very important to have real action , that we go further than just spouting fine words without actually doing anything .
Mr Watson and Mrs Terón i Cusí , amongst others , have taken up the issue of how we can become more effective , which is , of course , important .
Everyone stands to gain , including from the domestic point of view , if it works as it should .
Consequently it is important that this very constructive and important debate continues in the same way as it has done today .
Firstly , active and responsible participation by national authorities , civil society , the private sector and local players in the least developed countries .
I would remind you that 40 of the 49 least developed countries are also included in the group of ACP countries .
This means that any claims for a moratorium on debt payments before the debtor countries reach the so-called end point , and/or 100 percent debt is written off at this point , cannot be accepted .
The Regulation became applicable on 5 March this year .
Only in the matter of bananas , sugar and rice was it established that this should enter into force at a later date .
The Regulation is therefore of crucial economic significance for the least developed countries .
It shows that we will enter into the negotiations with the firm intention not just of serving our own interests , but also the interests of the most needy members of the global society , particularly the least developed countries .
It shows that the Union fully accepts a moral and economic responsibility in accordance with the Union ' s position as the world ' s biggest trading bloc .
I would also like to thank Mr Miranda in particular for giving us the opportunity through his question to discuss the important issues that are to be dealt with at the third conference on least developed countries , which will take place in Brussels next month , in a careful and penetrative way .
This is an opportunity to show that the Union is honest in its efforts to genuinely assist the least developed countries .
The Swedish Presidency has made conflict prevention one of its core issues .
The Council has also stated that it is prepared to continue to give practical support to the efforts to reach a peaceful solution to the conflict with full respect for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ' s sovereignty and territorial integrity .
At this time the Commission announced that it would double its financial support in the Presevo Valley .
The Council welcomed Javier Solana ' s status report , submitted on 19 March , concerning further EU measures in respect of south-east Serbia and urged him to continue his work on an EU strategy for this region in cooperation with the presidency and the Commission in order to support the process in the region and contribute to international efforts in reaching a peaceful solution .
The EU position is clearly stated in the declaration by the European Council issued in Stockholm on 23 March .
I have a supplementary question which concerns the demands that are now being made by the Albanian minority in Macedonia for increased influence and some form of self-rule or federation within Macedonia .
This was also concluded by both the Council and the European Council on several occasions .
I do not know whether this was a hymn of praise to Mr Solana .
I would therefore like to say that we in the Union - which also includes Mr Solana , who has really worked hard on this matter together with Mr Patten and the Swedish Presidency - can really be proud of what we have achieved , although it is not yet sufficient .
Who is it that must ensure that the UN Security Council ' s resolutions are observed ?
The honourable Member is clinging onto speculation regarding which the Council cannot comment further .
Where the national courts cannot or will not act , the international community has the ultimate responsibility for guaranteeing that justice is done .
With this aim in mind the Union started international efforts to encourage as many states as possible to sign up to the Rome Statute before the deadline expired on 31 December 2000 .
Italy , France , Belgium , Spain , Germany , Austria , Luxembourg and Finland have already ratified the Rome Statute .
