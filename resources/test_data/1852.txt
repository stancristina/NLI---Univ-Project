However , this must be done in conjunction with the harmonisation of the networks of areas bordering the European Union , because a great part of the burden comes from there .
Ladies and gentlemen , the accession of Bulgaria and Romania does not raise questions of political , economic or cultural geography for the European Union .
The crucial question , in my opinion , has to do with weighing the costs and benefits for the European Union in the event that accession is postponed .
The accession of these two countries will strengthen the homogenisation of the economic area of southeast Europe and , at the same time , will encourage the process of political and economic convergence of the Western Balkans on its path towards integration in the Union .
The way forward is politically preordained .
It contains an incentive and a warning : the incentive of accession on 1 January 2007 in accordance with the timetable and the warning that this objective will be achieved if both countries intensify their efforts in accordance with the final report which will be presented by the Commission .
I am certain that both Bulgaria and Romania will use the time they have , working day and night , to demonstrate that they are in a position to take what we have promised them : the ' January train ' for their accession and their unification with the European family .
Without these preconditions , the Doha Round will not have symmetrical results .
There will be no balance as regards its results .     Madam President , I should like to start by congratulating my honourable friend , Mrs Roth-Behrendt , on her exceptional work and to take this opportunity to hope that she will soon be well and back here with us , so that we can continue our very good cooperation .
The first reason is because we must oppose cannibalistic phenomena ; we are talking here of herbivores being fed animal proteins .
We say yes , except for Amendments 41 and 48 .     – Mr President , I wish first to thank Mr Böge for his excellent effort ; however the agreement achieved on the package of the financial perspectives for 2007 to 2013 between the three institutions of the European Union is , for us as a group , unacceptable .
This agreement is particularly inadequate from the point of view of financial resources .
Similarly , the agreement is inadequate from the point of view of priorities for meeting the economic , social and environmental challenges of an enlarged European Union .
With Parliament 's negotiation , a marginal improvement was achieved which , despite the fact that it is a far cry from the real financial needs of the Union , safeguards a minimal level of continuity in the financing of Community policies .
In other words , if the European Union continues to set objectives , without safeguarding in practical terms the means and political will to implement them , then the lack of confidence on the part of the citizens will increase constantly .
Mainly , however , we secured the 2009 review with our full involvement in the review process .
However , all together , with our systematic work in the Committee on Budgets , we basically achieved something else .
I believe that its institutional role will be strengthened as the process of European integration progresses and I am convinced that this development is the natural way forward for our political culture , especially in times when the citizens of Europe feel insecure about their future and , often , remote from the decision-making centres .
This is an historic achievement which constitutes a model of stability in the global system .
It is a state of affairs on which the citizens of Europe need to take an honest stand .
Freedom , equality and humanity are the high ideals which determine the content of the European idea and which need to be given meaning again today .
We defend the doctrine of 'security and freedom' , but not of 'security instead of freedom ' .
Equality is defined differently depending on the point of view from which you view the world .
Humanity is therefore the principle of European enlightenment which is nowadays proving to be the major demand of European societies and the major risk for the leaders of Europe .
Prosperity without wellbeing is simply a contradiction .
What is the vision we are trying to implement ?
Frequently there are delays , other times there are retractions , sometimes there is lassitude , but still the road leads on .
The view prevailed then – and rightly so – that the cost of not enlarging would be greater than the cost of enlargement .
Enlargement was certainly a very important development in the Union from the point of view of foreign relations too .
My country and I personally , as Minister of Foreign Affairs , have played a leading part in its processing and adoption .
The answer to this disappointment cannot but be to speed up the rate of the political enlargement process .
A Union of 25 Member States today , and more tomorrow , cannot exist and prosper except as an independent , strong and unified presence in the international system , with all that this implies .
The challenges are before us .
I also consider it important that the European Union has decided to continue sending aid to the Palestinians , given that depriving them of it will only exacerbate the problems .
The objectives of this strategy have not been achieved through its implementation .
Let us not delude ourselves ; it is clear that today , in the Union , there are two basic schools of thought as far as the implementation of the Lisbon objectives is concerned : the group that maintains that the development and the survival of the social
