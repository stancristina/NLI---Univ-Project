expected to cooperate .
Mr President , I should very much like to congratulate Mrs Langenhagen on her report .
In that connection , I should like to make it clear that , in view of the very great degree of expertise possessed by the Commission , we cannot accept that so many of the things we adopted in the decisions have not been implemented .
Before new programmes are put into effect , the previous programmes ought to be assessed .
With the help of the scientific research which is , of course , an important part of our policies - in this case , fisheries policy - a prior assessment needs to be carried out of what is wanted and of how the resources are used , so that existing resources can continually be adapted to catch techniques and catch opportunities .
Against the background of what has happened , those of us in the Committee on Fisheries also believe that , whenever three Directorates-General are to coordinate and direct actions , it ought to be completely clear which Directorate-General is ultimately in control , with responsibility for putting matters into effect .
Mrs President , you would not believe that Mr Dupuis and I were talking about the same text .
The Charter will not , of course , be written into the Treaty until after a special constitutional conference in 2004 but , as it receives the solemn signature of the Commission , the Council and Parliament , the European Court of Justice will already be acquiring a new source for its judgements , and the Court of Justice ' s representative has , of course , already given notice that it will draw inspiration from the Charter .
It is therefore absurd for the Danish Government to maintain that there is no trace of anything new in the Charter .
Naturally , the Charter contains innovations in relation to existing law .
The problem is not the content but the aim , which is to go one better than the national constitutions and the European Declaration of Human Rights .
In the Convention , I tabled amendments to the effect that the Charter should conform to the national constitutional courts and the Court of Human Rights .
The very fact that it was not possible to adopt these amendments witnesses to the aim of creating a constitution .
Unfortunately , I must therefore vote against the Charter .
Mr President , I can continue where Mr Gahrton left off .
In this way , it is precisely what is universal and indivisible in these areas that is weakened .
However , I also have problems with the structure we are in the process of setting up .
Indeed , the Council of Europe represents the whole of Europe , or all European States .
Finally , there is the problem of wanting to establish a constitution without democratic backing .
Mr President , first and foremost , I want to say thank you to the participants in the Convention , both from Parliament and from the Commission and the Council .
I think some very skilful work has been done .
It is a Charter which , to a large degree , accords the human being a central place .
Firstly , I think it is good to have made it clear that the Convention on Human Rights and the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg are to be respected .
At the same time , I think it is important to state that the common values must be established with reference to the different cultures and traditions we have in Europe .
I also want to highlight a particularly positive feature of the Charter , namely its concern with the issue of establishing very far-reaching provisions to rule out discrimination against minorities .
I also think it is good to have been far-sighted enough to have included new areas of protection in the picture .
I believe that adopting the Charter in Nice will be a powerful signal to certain applicant countries of the seriousness with which the EU regards respect for the fundamental freedoms .
Finally , I must say that I am very pleased that the Charter is being adopted in Nice as a political document .
I believe it will be a good basis for the dialogue we must have with the people of Europe about Europe ' s future development .
- ( DA ) Even if we support the fight against money laundering and can therefore also endorse the need to equip the relevant authorities with the right tools for the job , we cannot vote in favour of Mr Marinho ' s report .
In any case , the fight against money laundering takes place on a number of levels and , to start with , we see no need to establish maximum and minimum penalties for this at Community level .
- ( DA ) The Gebhardt report ' s undisguised intention to institutionalise judicial cooperation and make it into a supranational affair by setting up Eurojust is based upon a highly problematic premise .
Working these different legal traditions into the EU' s bureaucracies could lead to an Ã©litist and non-transparent system without any form of democratic support .
We are also strongly opposed to the ambition to make the EU into a constitutional State by establishing 'independent legislative , executive and judiciary ' bodies 'with counterbalancing powers ' .
That is why we are voting against the report .
Langenhagen Report ( A5-0310/2000 )
The aid has been too bureaucratic and too slow in coming , because the Commission has been too centralised and management-driven in its work .
It is very unfortunate that the agency has been split up into a headquarters in Thessaloniki and an operations centre in Pristina .
Moreover , the arrangement has now also been criticised by the Court of Auditors
