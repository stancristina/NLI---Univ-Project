Clearly , it would have been a disaster if the Commission 's original proposal had been adopted , and not only for Denmark .
I am therefore extremely pleased that we have succeeded - not as a result of the Commission , not as a result of the Council , but as a result of Parliament 's efforts - in ensuring a flexibility which , where there are special considerations , allows individual countries to say 'no ' to pesticides that they do not want , as of course should be the case .
Another very positive thing that I am extremely pleased we have adopted is that we will now have a ban on , and can phase out , some of the most dangerous substances contained in pesticides .
These are substances that have already been prohibited in other applications by means of the regulation , referred to as REACH , that we produced a couple of years ago .
This is , of course , totally unacceptable and I am therefore extremely pleased that we will now be rid of these dangerous substances in pesticides .
We have introduced action plans through which the individual countries are to achieve both a qualitative and quantitative reduction in the use of pesticides .
However , in conclusion I also have to say that there are things that could have been done much better .
These are substances that impair the development of children 's brains .
I also think that it is a shame that we have included the possibility of exempting these dangerous substances if industry can demonstrate the need to do this .
However , when it comes to the bottom line , I am pleased and satisfied .
This is a victory for health and for the environment .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to say that I am a little disappointed that after four years , we still have not seen a proposal from the Commission as to how we can tighten up the legislation on animal transport .
However , when will we have a proposal ?
It is also important that we achieve proper enforcement of the legislation .
However , we should go further still .
Research has shown that one hour can be too much if the animal is not strong enough to be transported , and longer journeys can be fine if the animal is strong and healthy and is transported under good conditions .
I would like to know how this rest station project is progressing .
It is difficult to get such a project off the ground but it is worth the attempt because it is important for our knowledge and research on animal welfare during transport to also be reflected in legislation and in practice .
Thank you , Mr President , Mr Cashman has written a good report , for which I would like to express my support .
The Commission 's revision of the 2008 Transparency Initiative will make public access to EU documents more difficult .
However , we still lack access to the advisory working parties within the Commission .
This is completely unacceptable .
I also need to know whether it is the chemicals industry or the environmental organisations sitting round the table when an aquatic environment plan is drawn up .
The result that we have achieved is a great success for the environment and for European shipping .
Shipping is a global activity and , for the sake of fair competition and for the sake of the environment , it is important to have common rules at a global level .
We must ensure that the EU Member States actually comply with the IMO agreements and this is what we are doing with the legislative package that we are concluding here .
The seven directives in the third maritime package will prevent pollution , ensure a better coordinated response to accidents and prevent poor ships from entering EU waters .
I have paid particularly close attention to the Directive on port State control and the Directive on the investigation of accidents as the shadow rapporteur for my group , and I would like to thank the two rapporteurs , Mrs Vlasto and Mr Kohlíček , for their proficient and successful work .
Thank you , Mr President , we have every reason to express our deepest satisfaction with the maritime package and I would like to say thank you on behalf of our group for the sterling work carried out by the rapporteurs , the Commission and the Council in this area .
We have special competent bodies to carry out inspections , but we do not have sufficiently clear rules for the seaworthiness of these ships or for when the inspection is to be carried out .
This often involves an increase in weight and an increase in engine size , which alters the centre of gravity and reduces seaworthiness , and , in my country , Denmark , we have seen numerous tragic accidents as a result .
Therefore , like Mr Costa , I would like to ask the Commission to extend the provisions on survey and approval to include these types of ship as soon as possible .
So , here we have one of the champions of the euro expressing his concern for the EU and the euro in the run-up to the recent summit .
I have not previously had reason to agree with Mr Delors , but in this case I must say that , unfortunately , he is right to be concerned .
The conclusions of the summit in this regard are very vague .
Throughout the crisis I have repeatedly questioned the Commission about its desire to regulate and control the financial sector .
It continually refers to the right of the internal market to govern what happens .
He said that the economies of Europe are too different for
