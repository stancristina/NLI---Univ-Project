year payment appropriations do not meet payment needs , the sunset clause will cause a new kind of problem .
Nobody could have predicted in May 1999 that there would be a need for reconstruction in Yugoslavia and Afghanistan in a situation in which the EU seems to have committed itself to the economic alleviation of the consequences of a US policy of aggression .
In the opinion of our group the ceilings in the interinstitutional agreement should be re-estimated .
The failure of the Moroccan fishing agreement was not an unforeseeable piece of expenditure for which the flexible instrument was really needed .
The breaking-up of the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets should have been totally financed next year in some way other than partially by means of the flexible instrument .
We are , however , critical of the fact that the ball has been set rolling for the EU budget to be used to finance the common foreign and security policy .
Perhaps the Commissioner knows .
Many of our aims were realised , and the directive must surely serve to contribute to general confidence both in the quality of donated blood and in the health protection of donors in an integrating Europe .
We would have been very glad to see an unconditional principle of non-remuneration applied throughout Europe ; now it is mentioned merely as a hoped-for goal , and not , unfortunately , as an obligation .
In the actual Article that concerns non-remuneration the hope is expressed that blood and blood components should be derived as far as possible from this type of donation .
I myself would have resolved the matter in individual cases without opening the floodgates to remuneration for all blood products .
There is also an ethical risk .
This could lead not only to exploitation but increased risk .
I hope that when in time this directive is reviewed , we will also consider the part the principle of non-remuneration has to play .
It is essential that matters like these that are so important for human life , such as the quality of blood and its safety , are guaranteed everywhere in Europe .
The wording of the conciliation decision also refers to this .
When in conciliation the greatest worry in the final stages was what level of health professional should carry out a health examination of donors , in my opinion the final outcome was very good indeed .
Mr President , the report by my colleague , Mr Florenz , is one of the most important achievements this parliamentary term from Parliament 's point of view .
Firstly , producers are now to be made responsible for the complete life cycles of the equipment they sell .
This is precisely the way we can ensure that product design takes account of the environment and therefore the directive 's whole viability .
Secondly , we have to mention our rapporteur 's splendid solution regarding the obligation to recycle , something that has been fully achieved , but regarding which there has to be evidence of a rate of four kilograms of waste per inhabitant a year .
Furthermore , market mechanisms have been used just as they should : there will be positive incentives to encourage more ecological behaviour .
In so far as it is possible , it will be the responsibility of the local authorities , and the producer 's liability for costs starts at the collection point .
I believe that we have found an excellent model in the WEEE Directive , which , hopefully soon , we will be able to apply to many other product groups .
I myself have been a steadfast advocate of Parliament 's opinions , as in many ways we are dealing with matters that have to do with Parliament 's essential function .
Thirdly , we are promoting sustainable development in the manner outlined at the Rio Summit .
The exceptionally large number of differing opinions with regard to amendments was a special challenge during conciliation .
Furthermore , we observed that the Council , once we had actually achieved conciliation , was not at all willing , according to the country holding the Presidency , to produce a directive .
This is not just any solution , either .
As a result of conciliation the opportunities to resort to these are limited , meaning real transparency can be achieved .
Another important outcome of the negotiations concerns payments .
A third important outcome of the negotiations is that a special new section on the requirements for the quality of environmental information was approved for the directive .
Member States must ensure that the information is up to date , accurate , and , above all , capable of being used for comparisons .
The quality of information is especially important now that the availability of information is being granted as a right to a wide public , and one , therefore , that is unfamiliar with that specific subject .
Other practical arrangements agreed in the directive are also viable and fair from the point of view of the authorities that are responsible for implementing them .
It seems very easy to make grand statements about eEurope , but when it is a matter of an obligation to create concrete content for an eEurope , some Member States even oppose the Internet being mentioned .
In this way they will not be taking up the time of the authorities in attending to their request .
The outcome of conciliation can be regarded as satisfactory as far as Parliament is concerned , as the minimum targets laid down in the Ã…rhus Convention are exceeded in all essential respects and an important step is being taken in the ratification of the Convention .
I warmly recommend the acceptance of this outcome of conciliation in tomorrow 's vote .
