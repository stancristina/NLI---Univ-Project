increasingly determined by global WTO agreements , means that agriculture will continue to change .
It is in our best interests that young farmers are well prepared to anticipate and to manage these future challenges .
Food safety measures and production methods are being thoroughly analysed these days .
There is greater emphasis on organic production throughout Europe .
Here again , young farmers must be placed in a position which will allow them to embrace a new upcoming culture and to be aware of the benefits attached to maintaining consumer confidence and support for agricultural products .
There is tremendous scope for innovative and creative local high-quality production .
The European agricultural industry is going through a difficult economic period with a great deal of restructuring going on at the same time .
There is a great need to assist some of the older farmers to retire in dignity .
In this context , I would very much like see a retirement package for existing farmers linked to bringing in young farmers to carry on the industry .
I would like to ask Commissioner Fischler to recommend to Member States that they introduce such a policy throughout the EU.
We are seeing the average age of the farming Community increase with falling numbers of young farmers .
This trend must be reversed .
Young farmers need greater access to production rights .
It is not easy to balance the delivery of additional production rights to young farmers if they have to be taken away from existing farmers who themselves are already facing financial difficulties .
When , in future , production rights are changed , I would like to ask the Commission to take into greater account the need to increase the amount of extra production which is given to young farmers .
With the emphasis in the CAP on giving increasing importance to rural development schemes , it is crucial to recognise the young farmers as the key players and main executives responsible for the implementation of such new rural redevelopment policies .
With the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union , I would strongly advise the applicant Member States to start creating supportive measures for their young farmers already at present , especially in view of the introduction of production controls required by the Commission .
In many parts of the world , share farming is a common practice .
I would like to ask the Commission to investigate the possibilities for developing share farming within the common agricultural policy .
As I have already mentioned , this report is an own initiative report of the Committee on Agriculture , and I hope all parties will be able to sign up for this report and make sure positive practical help is given young farmers in the future .
I would also like to thank Commissioner Fischler once more for his support and also ask him to introduce an audit to be carried out every two years on the availability and success of measures put in place to support young farmers .
It is very important that we do not just pay great lip service to helping young farmers , but actually deliver policies within the common agricultural policy that increase the number of young farmers coming into the industry .
Mr President , the report deals with a most difficult subject : the prospects for young people in the farming industry , as the rapporteur has indicated , are probably worse than at any time since the creation of the CAP and their prospects cannot be separated from those of the industry as a whole or from the prosperity of the rural communities .
One measure of the complexity of the situation can be found in the courses which are now offered at agricultural colleges .
At the two colleges in my region the number of courses relating to farming has now fallen to 40 % in one case , and the remaining 60 % of the courses relate to horses and small animals .
Significantly , 70 % of the students , however , come from farming families , so there is still that link .
The report spells out that there is a strong case for measures to encourage new entrants to the industry and for achieving a much greater degree of standardisation across the European Union , and the issue , as the rapporteur mentioned , was well dealt with in the excellent STOA report at the beginning of last year .
There are many good examples in that document of the valuable background material which we were able to use during discussions in committee .
Now that the rural development programme is in place it is important to examine how this programme can be used to strengthen training and re-training facilities in our agricultural colleges .
I would emphasise the need for training in farm diversification , including low-volume products for niche markets , and cooperative marketing techniques where , by coming together , individual farms can seek to match the commercial bargaining strength of the supermarket chains .
I would also wish to see such courses paying special attention to the needs of the smaller farm where new entrants are most likely to be found .
I hope that the Commission and the national governments will take note of the many excellent suggestions in this report and thus give a boost to the future prosperity of farming in the rural areas .
Mr President , I also commend Mr Parish for his hard work and the excellent report .
In the brief time I have I wish to stress that one of the greatest difficulties facing young farmers entering the business today is capital and cash-flow problems in the first year of operation .
I am backing this proposal because young people must be given the opportunity to come into the industry on a sound financial footing
