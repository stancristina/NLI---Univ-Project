So far , these have been underestimated , but the serious effects are becoming increasingly clear .
Concerning warnings , the rules of the importing countries could prevail .
The product concerned is also more expensive .
If we mainly wish to discourage people from taking up smoking at a young age , this is not the target group .
You can be unlucky and have a car crash , or abuse alcohol , but with tobacco , the life-threatening aspect is always there .
We as regulators should at least try to practise damage limitation .
The first one is : 'het is geen man die niet roken kan' [he who does not smoke is not a man] , whilst the second one reads : 'een tevreden roker is geen onruststoker ' [a satisfied smoker does not cause any trouble] .
Accordingly , tobacco is not just about economic interests , rather it is far more of a public health problem .
In addition , it should not be possible for people to buy cigarettes at supermarkets , caf√©s or petrol stations as an afterthought .
We do , however , fully agree with the other opinions in our group that American chains should not be in a position , on account of free imports , to plug the gap which will emerge if European production drops , and that economically weaker regions in Southern Europe should be given support in order to create replacement employment when tobacco production disappears .
In addition , with misleading messages such as "light " and "ultra light " , the tobacco industry is trying to create the impression that the relevant tobacco products are less harmful .
Warnings should appeal to the smokers ' own perception of the environment and should not be formulated such that their effect is like water off a duck ' s back .
The warning that smoking causes impotence could possibly work , especially if it is illustrated , as young people take a great interest in sex .
The European Union too , should know that smoking is unhealthy .
Smoking is unhealthy .
A sound approach , however , would be to make the European standard compulsory in the case of export to countries where such standards are lacking .
I take exception to the fact that the consumer is considered as someone who cannot judge for himself what he should or should not do .
Either way , the marine environment is polluted .
Thanks to the European Parliament ' s perseverance , this was also included in legislation .
This is one of Europe ' s great opportunities , but digital television also plays an important role .
I think that we can guide this process along to some extent , but the initiative has to come from the industry .
The must carry rules must continue to exist as long as they are proportionate and restricted to those stations which are intended to fall within the scope of Protocol 32 annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam .
Traditional boundaries between telecom companies , entertainment industry and journalistic media are becoming increasingly blurred .
We have noticed that in many Member States , media policy , in particular , is still all too often being adopted at national level .
We have been able to establish a sound dialogue , which is what is important at the end of the day .
I honestly hope that the Commission will move further in the direction we have proposed .
One is that national supervisory bodies are still working in isolation and my report offers an enormous boost to these bodies to link up , merge or integrate with the general national competition authorities and , where necessary , with media supervisory bodies .
We also need to ask ourselves how long we need to continue the specific sector supervision .
If something happens to me , it should be possible to trace me immediately .
Mr President , surely it should not be the case that Parliament could be sidelined in this day and age .
These rules require the necessary flexibility , as rapporteur Van Velzen pointed out with good reason .
However , this sector is not just about access for everyone and as much freedom as possible for the consumer .
This leads to an increase in the capital cost for companies and presents a considerable obstacle in the establishment of an efficient European Union capital market with the best possible capital allocation .
This EU approval mechanism will comprise a political and technical aspect .
The pressure exerted by the markets and Member States to make the necessary changes to the legislative framework as soon as possible is considerable .
It is thus up to that committee from the private sector to lay down these standards .
Mr President , I have adopted the approved resolution from the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport .
As the rapporteur , with whom I worked extremely well , has already remarked himself , this is an extremely peculiar financing method , and I can think of at least three reasons why this is so .
As already indicated , it proposed to convene a trialogue and to include the solution which emerges from this exercise in the budget procedure for 2001 .
But the proposed alternative , namely to dip into budget lines which have not been used over the year , demonstrates how little insight there is into the budget discipline .
I have also suggested including this in the Euratom Treaty at the forthcoming IGC negotiations in Nice .
It will be evident that this state of affairs also has a bearing on finances .
In any event , I would like to thank him for his report .
I think that a genuine solution has not been found or cannot be found
