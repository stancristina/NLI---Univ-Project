In general , public access to third-party documents still poses a major problem , because in this respect , particularly the Commission and the Council are more rigid than required .
Those ultimately reaping the benefits of this Regulation , however , are our own citizens .
Access to documents forms an essential part of this transparency .
Indeed , the exchange of information is the driving force behind the public debate in the media , public control and contributions by public organisations .
I am speaking at a time when we in Europe should all be acutely aware of the importance and power of our democracy , but also of its vulnerability .
Everyone is agreed that it is of great importance that this matter should be brought to a prompt close .
Additional expenses which the new rules entail , if they put the operation of certain airports at risk , should be reimbursed , whereby , however , the principle applies that in the medium term , the costs must be borne by the users and the sector .
So far , the Council has appeared unsympathetic to our requests to strike better deals on security as well as security measures with third countries too .
The Council , on the other hand , took a completely different view .
This will be extremely detrimental to some institutions because the legislations are very different in the area of restrictions .
And I would invite Mrs Hautala and Mr Beysen to change this topic too .
The European Commission was in agreement with this .
What transpired ?
For fourteen minutes , I have been listening to a virtual speaking dummy that stated why certain amendments are to be welcomed or not .
It is a revision of a directive , which , in this case , means that two very important changes have been made , the substance of which we are satisfied with in any case .
A number of the European Parliament 's amendments were already adopted at first reading - we are now discussing the second reading .
This is a huge step forward in my view .
As an economic sector , the tourism industry accounts for 5 % of jobs in the European Union .
In addition , the Commission 's initiative to establish an annual , European tourism forum at which the sector itself can set its priorities , receives our full support .
Recent events in aviation have illustrated this .
This is another reason why the measures to be taken in the tourism sector should be well thought through .
I struggle to think who could match their knowledge and expertise .
Accordingly , the inclusion of a legal basis for tourism in the treaties does not receive our support .
They gave us a good feeling afterwards , a feeling of solidarity , and that is actually what we want to work on together this year .
A fine concept , whereby the European idea is spread .
I should personally like to let the Commissioner know that our thoughts are with him in the difficult times he is currently facing on account of his wife 's illness .
The Belgian Presidency was first-rate , but the Spanish Presidency is a fine example of how it is possible for the Council and Parliament to work together , and I believe that it is thanks to the Council that we have managed it .
Except , of course , that the budget has made a distinct shift towards us .
At the moment , there is no real European Research Area .
This is a brain drain , and we need these brains in order to turn Europe into the world 's most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy .
And this is what is sometimes lacking when it comes to implementing agreements concluded in the socio-economic field .
Finally , I understand that the method of open coordination does not function entirely satisfactorily .
It is very convenient for leaders and large businesses if citizens cannot access information , if they cannot access it in time or if they are unable to respond in time to measures which privileged groups find important .
( NL ) Unlike trains or buses , aircraft are completely dependent on the uninterrupted operation of their engines for their safety .
I have great difficulty with the continuous series of proposals that are based on the survival of an organisational model that will ultimately lead to uncontrollable accidents .
These problems in particular are only considered to be the responsibility of the local and regional governments , while the 'tourist as a milch cow ' is seen as something that falls within the EU 's remit .
Let us indeed persuade the Convention to call for an end to this mad situation .
Needless to say , it is a total nightmare from an organisational point of view too .
Lengthy discussions have been held , and what is the outcome ?
I implore you to do this .
We would have hardly paid any attention to the region if it were not for the fact that it will be forming an enclave in the European Union .
After all , many of the restrictions are man-made .
It is true that a debate on Chechnya took place on 10 April .
All my sources of information also suggest that the Council does not really take Parliament 's view into consideration .
In my view , it is crucial for us to be well acquainted with this political commitment , this clear line .
I would like you to explain something in more detail .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this evening , food once again occupies a prominent place on our agenda .
Many hours of work and consultation have gone into this report .
Against globalisation , against
