Since the outcome of this research is uncertain , we support the fall-back position , as formulated in Paragraph 20 of the report , in the form of a European environmental levy .
I share Mrs Foster ' s view that aviation is a major economic sector , a sector which provides services which are irreplaceable up to a point .
There are important negotiations under way , Commissioner , which will have a positive outcome , or at least we can still be hopeful of this .
Whilst the previous two focused on the freedom and growth potential within aviation , this one highlights the downside , justifiably so , in my opinion .
Despite our positive attitude to this report , there are a number of elements which , in my opinion , do not belong in a report such as this one .
We should however urge caution .
I am very aware that this would be a bonus for some , but do remember that , for airline passengers who need to travel short distances , there is still no real alternative , contrary to what one of my fellow MEPs just stated , to the effect that we would all much prefer to see such passengers travel by train. .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am here to talk about noise generated by car tyres .
It should have been dealt with in the Council of Ministers for the Environment .
This is why it is important to make the necessary changes here too , and I hope that a number of the Christian-Democrat MEPs will be able to vote in favour of this .
Cars inherently cause a large number of environmental problems .
With regard to a few specific problems which sport is having to contend with , I would like to say the following on the issue of transfers .
Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Mennea , for this extremely valuable report .
The reason being that UEFA , together with a large number of national football federations , is organising a meeting during the next part-session in October and I would ask you to attend , together with Mr Monti .
I back the Commission proposal but I do hope that it will make provision for recovering training expenses for players between the ages of 18 and 24 , as , for example , is being proposed at the moment by FIFA , the international football association , and FIFPRO , the organisation for players .
As to the question of whether sport should be dealt with at European level , I certainly believe it should .
Fortunately , over the past few years , this attitude has started to change .
Far too often , we see that the short-term interests of powerful industrial groups are given priority , whilst the majority of our electorate increasingly sets different requirements for political decision-making .
Protecting the quality of our life , rather than making a fast buck , is gaining in importance all the time .
Commercial and industrial cloning , or cloning in order to create people with certain characteristics is unacceptable in everyone ' s book , and rightly so .
Moreover , it appears as though it will be possible , within the next couple of years , to use the recipients own brain stem cells to grow organs which are not rejected by their bodies .
For this reason alone , aviation can win the unfair competitive battle against the railways , which have lost a large part of their share of international passenger transport to other modes of long-distance travel , especially aviation .
After all , playing is in our make-up and benefits our health and sense of well-being .
If we are to counter these expressions of hostility , which we also encounter during international sports events in our countries , sportsmanship needs to be placed at the top of the bill once again .
The nuclear contamination of the village Muslyumovo , in the southern Ural , with plutonium - and this is as long ago as 1949 - is a poignant example of this utterly reprehensible behaviour .
The answer is simple .
May this serve as a warning to Europe .
The European Union and European Parliament will need to make it clear that it is in Europe ' s general interest , and as such in that of Russia , to lay this matter to rest sooner rather than later , firstly on behalf of the relatives , whom we offer our deepest sympathy , and secondly for the benefit of the nuclear situation in Europe .
Unfortunately , the fighting has not stopped and some parties have refused to sign the peace accord .
Only if Africans are willing to share power does this continent have a future .
The neighbouring countries Congo and Tanzania , from where the armed groups operate , must also be reminded of their responsibilities .
With 200 000 fatalities in Burundi , Commissioner , there is clearly a need for a peace deal or a peace accord .
I have always regretted the notorious boycott of Burundi , particularly as it was so selective .
However , it still benefits from investments , including investments from European countries , such as those of the French oil company Total and the Dutch hydraulics industry , and there has been no attempt to block this kind of investment , either on the part of the EU or on the part of national Member States .
Mr President , Turkey is one of the NATO countries and is applying to join the European Union .
The attacks on Indian properties could apparently take place undisturbed and without any intervention by the body of officials responsible for order .
The European Parliament which ,
