Wordy proclamations will not produce the changes we now need .
The EU must ensure that it has in future an effective non-military range of options at its disposal both to prevent a crisis and to put out fires that have already started .
It is such an immense challenge that the Finnish Presidency will be required to show it has the special ability to keep all the interwoven threads tightly in its hands .
Finland has to ensure that all allocated funds are used effectively .
The reconstruction programme should be funded in a way that takes account of the use of local resources .
Aid must go to where it is most needed .
Ensuring the single market functions effectively and strengthening the Union 's internal security are the important keys to successful enlargement .
Furthermore , the ideas expressed concerning the Union 's northern dimension need to be made into more concrete programmes of action .

Mr President , Members of the Council , Ms Halonen , the start of Finland 's first presidential term in the European Union marks a time of great change .
One of the most pressing matters we are expecting Parliament and the Council to resolve is a proper arrangement relating to members ' pay and expenses .
The principle of transparency will be promoted in a very real sense with the development of open sessions of the Council , better accessibility to documents , and the general availability of Council and working party agendas and meeting schedules .
It must be said , however , that the efficient functioning of the Union has already met with obstacles during this session .
I cannot help wondering why the right-wing group in the Parliament is attempting to postpone the appointment of the Commission using the report by the Committee of Independent Experts as an excuse .
We must speed up the drawing up of the report and the proper debate on it in Parliament in every way possible , but we cannot surrender the legal rights of the Parliament to an unofficial investigative body and give in to the timetable it imposes .
The Finnish President , Martti Ahtisaari , made a sound contribution to the achievement of a solution for Kosovo , showing that a non-aligned state can also successfully represent the common view of the Union as a whole .
Finland has quite rightly pointed out that it is necessary to connect the enlargement process with Europe 's influence on developments in the areas of environmental protection and social welfare .
The northern dimension policy , which has been approved by the Union , covers inter alia co-operation in the Baltic region , but it also supports the implementation of the approved strategy on Russia .
The main issue in need of reform is genuine cross-border co-operation , which needs to be strengthened .
So there are various challenges .
It really cannot be stressed enough that Finland is embarking on its Presidency in quite problematic circumstances .
Foreign Minister , you said that the Kosovo crisis might prove to be a sort of turning point in EU common foreign and security policy .
My group 's position is that the European Union must strengthen its common foreign and security policy , but we would hope that Finland , which is a militarily non-aligned State , will emphasise the importance of the non-military aspect of crisis management .
Our group would like to remind everyone that the European Parliament this Spring approved a report recommending the establishment of non-military peacekeeping bodies for the European Union .
During the Finnish Presidency , we will be involved in preparations for future world trade talks .
I am now referring to what happened with the Multilateral Agreement on Investment .
We will give you all our support , so that the Directive on an energy tax can finally be issued .
We have been preparing it for seven years now .
At the same time it is obviously necessary to strengthen the marketability of labour .
It also has to promote civil rights , as well as improve the status of third country citizens legally resident in the Member States of the European Union .

Right at the start , the EU 's Finance Ministers , under the leadership of Finland , reached the conclusion that it is only possible to speak of EMU within the EU if it is with one voice .
As a result , we have now fallen silent in eleven languages over the subject of monetary policy in the EU.
Finland is a non-aligned country , and not a member of NATO .
NATO is also now an organisation on the offensive .
For my part , I would like to make two points .
As far as the future of the Union is concerned the most important tasks of the Council will be tied , on the one hand , to enlargement , and , on the other , to improving the Union 's decision-making machinery , both of which hinge on one another .
The Union , which is achieving pan-European dimensions , can only function properly if it develops more as a union of independent states rather than a federation .
This being the case , action cannot be restricted merely to the points not covered by the Treaty of Amsterdam .
The Swiss system is often referred to as a confederation .
My other point is connected with the northern dimension .
During its presidential term , Finland must try to speed up developments associated with the northern dimension .
The northern dimension means that the situation and circumstances pertaining to the northern regions should be taken into consideration in all Union decision making .
I apologise sincerely for not being able to respond to all the excellent , well-considered and immensely important speeches that we have heard here today .
In September , when
