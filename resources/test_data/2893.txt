In order to make that absolutely clear , I will readily provide copies of that letter and all other relevant correspondence to the honourable Members as soon as I have confirmation from Mrs Gradin that she has no objection to that course of action .
Mrs Gradin has indicated by an indirect route that she would be agreeable to such a release of correspondence but naturally , as a matter of courtesy to her , I prefer to have direct confirmation of her agreement .
Mrs Gradin replied to my 22 November letter on 29 December and I wrote a further letter to her on 25 January 2001 .
As I pointed out in that letter to Mrs Gradin , and as the House will be aware , the Staff Regulations applicable to all EU institutions make it clear that the Commission as an institution and as an employer is legally liable to assist employees in defending themselves against attack .
That obligation also means defending an acquitted person against any questioning of their innocence of the charges on which they were acquitted .
My 22 November letters to Mrs Gradin and Mr Asp therefore related entirely to such legal obligations and considerations and to absolutely nothing else .
As I made clear in my letter of 25 January to Mrs Gradin , whilst all liberties of speech are precious and must be upheld , the expression of certain opinions - for instance those that may be considered to defame others - can have legal consequences in all democratic societies , and have specific implications for the Commission as an employing European institution .
In that letter I also made clear beyond doubt that my letter of 22 November was not in any way an attempt to limit free comment or to prevent criticism of the Commission either by Mrs Gradin , or indeed by Mr Asp or anyone else .
All this will be evident to honourable Members when they have the chance to read the exchange of correspondence , as I hope they will .
That will also enable them to see that the basis for consideration of the actions of former commissioners and former officials is the Treaty and the Staff Regulations .
Mrs Gradin has obviously always taken her duty of discretion provided for in the Treaty seriously as a responsible and reputable person .
I am sure that will continue .
Mr President , I would like first of all to say to Mr FÃ¤rm by that if he examines the Staff Regulations to which Mr Asp is subject , then he will see the basis on which he was written to by his former employing authority and he will see that what was said in that letter was entirely in keeping with the regulations and the requirements of communication - no more , no less .
Mr Andersson may have his own view about the case that was referred to in the TV documentary .
That is not what this question is about and it is not what my letter to Mrs Gradin was about , but he is a democrat and he will understand .
In Sweden , as in any other Member State , or democratic society , caution must be exercised in making a declaration about anyone who has been acquitted of a particular charge that could imply defamation of that person .
That is a general rule that is understood and upheld by democrats everywhere , but in the case of the Commission as an employing institution , as I pointed out earlier , there is an additional implication that if a Commission official is attacked and if it is a Commission official in a specific case who has been acquitted under due process of a charge , than that official can make claims upon the Commission and therefore on taxpayers ' money under Article 24 of the Staff Regulations in order to fight that case of alleged defamation .
The point that I made to Mrs Gradin , which I am sure she completely understands - especially since I explained in full in my most recent letter , simply relates to that legal reality and the proper discharge of the functions of the Commission as a legally constituted organisation with obligations set down in law in the form of the Staff Regulations .
Mr Andersson may have his own views about the particular cases referred to in the TV documentary .
He is entitled to those views whether they are right , wrong , substantiated or otherwise , but he will understand , I am certain , that all the actions taken in relation to people named in that television documentary , and one in particular , relate to the legal questions - as I emphasised in my letter to Mrs Gradin and in my earlier reply - and not to wider judgments which may be a matter entirely for Mr Andersson 's view and his own conscience .
I will not say or do anything at any point which could result in unfair and unjustified charges on the Commission , the European Union and on the taxpayers ' money , when there are other means of ensuring that the law is upheld so far as individuals are concerned .
I say to Mr Gahrton that the problem is not one of transparency in this case , it is of the deficiencies either of his hearing or his understanding .
What I said was not ridiculous .
I will send him a copy of my reply and when I have the agreement of Mrs Gradin for the release of the letters that we exchanged , including my personal letter to her of 25 January , written in an official capacity , he can see it .
But I am sure that he will understand , as someone who observes the courtesies and
