Question No 36 by (H-0867/00 ) Subject : Texaco-Chevron merger Under what framework and in what timescale does the Commission expect to respond to the announcement of a worldwide merger between the Texaco and Chevron oil companies ?
Is it aware of allegations of serious human rights abuse against Texaco in Ecuador and against Chevron in Nigeria , both leading to pending lawsuits ?
What part will this play in the Commission ' s deliberations , and what evidence will the Commission seek from the companies in this respect ?
That is not an unexpected answer from Mr Monti .
However , he and his colleagues should understand that every time one of these mergers takes place we are going to carry on asking the question .
Mr Patten , sitting alongside him , must have been squirming when he heard that answer , because in the previous question we heard a great lecture on respect for human rights .
Then suddenly when it comes to the European Union 's economic powers , they are blithely ignored .
Let me say about Texaco that the Centre for Economic and Social Rights says that in Ecuador they are responsible for a high occurrence of abortion and abnormally high cancer rates .
They have been accused by Ecuador 's own national oil company of dominating indigenous peoples .
In Nigeria , Chevron has been accused by the All-Ijaw indigenous people of instigating violence against them and actually paying Nigerian soldiers to shoot protesters at the Warri naval base .
Whatever you say about the legal base and concern over competition policy , the public in Europe is concerned about such abuses of human rights .
If you are not willing to act now , I suggest that you signpost how other action could be taken by your colleagues in the Commission against abuses of human rights which are unacceptable to all of us .
Question No 40 by (H-0889/00 ) Subject : Market access for less developed and developing countries Does the Commission intend to honour its obligation under the Cotonou Agreement to consult ACP countries , and undertake country and sector specific impact studies , before the Council takes a decision on the Commission 's proposals to grant duty-free and quota-free access to the European market for all products , except armaments , from the world 's 48 least developed or developing countries ?
Mr President , may I thank the Commissioner very much for his very positive reply about cooperation with Parliament .
I am sure all my colleagues are very grateful .
This particular subject is of great concern to British sugar beet growers as you can imagine , because it is about the only crop that is profitable in the UK at the moment .
I represent some growers and I am thus very concerned indeed .
I note , incidentally , that British Conservatives claim to represent the countryside in the UK, yet not one of them is present in the Chamber to ask you a question .
Would you please tell us what you think the impact on the price of sugar will be in the UK as a result of your proposal ?
Mr President , may I thank the Commissioner for his answer .
Would you confirm , Commissioner , that the Coreper GSP Working Group has been postponed for the second time ?
Is that because they are waiting for a revised proposal from you and for the impact studies ?
Secondly , you talked about the spirit of Cotonou being honoured .
That is not the view of the ACP trade ministers who met this week , who said that they would expect the European Commission to honour existing agreements .
What they feel , Commissioner , is that Cotonou was very carefully negotiated by the ACP and that within five months , almost before the ink is dry , there are proposals without any consultation .
Of course , you had consultation after the event , but not before , which is part of the agreement under Cotonou , as you know , as is the need for joint impact studies to be undertaken .
Thirdly , Commissioner , would you agree with me that vulnerable small island economies , particularly of course in the Caribbean , who are dependent on certain commodities like bananas , sugar and rice , should deserve to be a special case ?
Commissioner Lamy , when I asked you about this earlier this year at a previous Question Time you said this was not possible for a further five or six years .
Can you explain what has changed your mind ?
There are many cynical people amongst the developing countries who see this simply as a way of trying to buy them off in future WTO negotiations .
Are you being sincere in trying to help developing countries ?
Can you comment on the analysis given by some NGOs that the least-developed countries , without capacity-building measures , without a change in the sugar price , given the fact that they are net sugar importers , may not be able to exploit what we are offering ?
Finally , can you comment on whether this was discussed within the College of Commissioners today ?
If so , what was the nature of that discussion and would you expect any movement on this issue before you come before our committee on Development and Cooperation next Strasbourg on 16 January ?
As my colleague Bill Newton-Dunn said , we have a number of colleagues in the UK who are indulging in fairly standard if facile anti-European scaremongering on this proposal and they have got a large number of sugarbeet farmers extremely worried .
We need your help to be able to persuade our constituents and our farming community that the claims made by the anti-European wing in our political environment , and indeed others , are wrong .
To that end , could
