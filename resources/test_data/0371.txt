The agreement that has just been established will actually raise standards in several EU countries .
Finally - and perhaps most significantly - the agreement makes financial provision for research into better traps .
That has to be better than an import ban , a case with the WTO and European hunters failing to live up to the standards .
Mr President , I must say I find the results of Mr Rosado Fernandes ' work on this report rather disappointing .
As if that were not bad enough , the rapporteur also strongly emphasizes the need to support young farmers to enable them to take over production .
I searched the report in vain for any support of the Commission 's excellent initiative of buying up quotas from farmers wishing to leave the sector .
I searched in vain for new thinking on how to support and educate farmers in these vulnerable areas in how to switch production to non-hazardous products .
Further , I find it most regrettable that the rapporteur did not wish to give more financial support to the research fund .
Or is it being muzzled intentionally ?
In my opinion , the report smacks of a compromise of many diverse positions on how to view the reform .
I looked in vain for any strong pronouncements in specific areas such as the environment and animal welfare .
After all , we must not forget that environmental improvements are not purely the domain of the 15 current Member States .
The nations of central and eastern Europe applying for admittance to the EU also have significant agricultural production .
Thus , through support and collaboration , we must help ensure good , environmentally sound production for these farmers .
We must avoid a situation whereby these farmers resort to sacrificing the environment as they strive to keep up with the competition of the internal market .
Mr President , I would like to begin by praising the Commissioner 's proposal , for it endeavours to strike an admirable balance between the different producers ' interests .
In reality , there is precious little room for manoeuvre .
The Commission 's proposal to support ACP producers paves the way for changes in production , and there must be due regard for the environment , but that is not specific enough .
In this regard , I am not suggesting a particular quota , but rather , support for changes in production , a definition of fair trade bananas , arrangements for labelling and monitoring , and support for publicity and marketing of fair trade bananas .
At first reading , I thought we and the Commission had made good progress .
I can understand the Council being a little more cautious in the text we received subsequently .
But what is it all about ?
It also has something to do with transportation , environmental considerations , integrity , etcetera .
Regulations are fine .
But in my view , free will can go a long way .
There has to be the will to make implementation a reality in all Member States .
I would like to ring a little alarm bell about one proposal , however .
The amendment proposed by the House reads , " ... convicted of serious offences against the rules in force concerning road haulage ' .
What is " serious ' supposed to mean ?
Who is going to define how serious something has to be before intervention is necessary ?
If you can see sex appeal in a car , you definitely will not be pulling any birds .
To my mind , it is wasteful to pay out £10 , 000 to remove a window in order to get a car into a building , followed by another £10 , 000 to get it out again .
It is downright wasteful of taxpayers ' money .
I have to say we must be way off track if we are now starting to advertise for the USA .
I think we need to stop these propaganda exercises .
It is a disgrace and people are at a loss to understand it .
I would like to look at this matter more in terms of principle .
The Council has also followed the recommendations in the document forwarded by the Commission .
My premise is that we should deal with trans-border fiscal matters .
My honourable friend Mr Gallagher from Ireland made a fine contribution this afternoon , amply illustrating the problems of company taxation .
The second point I would like to mention is environmental taxes or duties .
Here , too , we need to keep in step .
Once again , we have heard Ms Lulling and also Mr Fayot speaking earlier today about returns on investments , interest , and so forth .
What is the good of agreeing on uniform taxation of interest if we cannot even locate the interest ?
Finally , we have what are known as excise duties - as mentioned previously - on spirits , wine , cars , and so on .
However , I do not think we should touch on personal taxation .
Overall , the tax ratio is actually fairly uniform .
However , adding it all up , for more than half the members of the Union , much the same tax ratio goes on welfare and welfare services .
Thus , I am glad to see that we have established that the report is dealing with transnational rights rather than national professional rights .
I am also glad that we have established that the question of wages will remain exempt from European legislation .
In my opinion , the report is good because it paves the way for much-needed debate .
If so desired by the parties concerned , such discussions could be raised to the level of European legislation , so European trade unions already have some collective rights .
