This is in the face of announcements of excessive risks taken by some Western European banks established in those countries .
Finally , I would like to mention the importance of the euro as an anchor for the strategies for withstanding the blows of the crisis and emerging from it .
It is true that these countries have more fragile economies .
The latter have belonged to the European Union for much longer , have been receiving finance from the European Investment Bank and the Structural Funds for much longer and are in the euro area , and they have equally serious or sometimes more serious problems than many of the economies of Central and Eastern Europe .
Do we need to cooperate more ?
Indeed , I believe that it is important , at times like these , to use the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund in a different way from that envisaged under normal circumstances .
It has been of such depth that we can imagine how , for example , Ireland has made such extremely difficult adjustments , not because the International Money Fund says so , or because it has been imposed by anyone from Brussels , but because the Irish authorities consider it to be the best way to adjust its economy as soon as possible and move forward with the same impetus that it had before the crisis .
We are still facing a great deal of uncertainty , and the obstacles that we have to tackle are very significant , but there is light at the end of the tunnel .
Having said that , it must be said that the foreign banks in those countries are conducting themselves extraordinarily well , as I have already said .
This is also something to consider for the future .
It is the courage and dignity of the victims that is the greatest failure of terrorism and therefore the greatest triumph of democracy .
Its multiannual programme for 2009-2014 includes an express , necessary reference to the dignity of victims of terrorism , the suffering caused by this terrible form of crime , their particular vulnerability , but also , and above all , to the mandate for protecting them .
Their testimonies drive me to advocate a European standard of looking after the victims of terrorism from a material , emotional and legal point of view .
In Europe , murder has been committed in the name of religion , Marxism , private property , environmentalism , the independence of a region or the unity of the State of which it is a part .
Firstly , we are talking about a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights , which is not a European Union institution but rather a court - one that is part of a concentric circle of the European Union , but is separate - which is committed to the Rule of Law , representative democracy and human rights .
It is only on that basis that it is up to the Member States to make the appropriate decisions about amendments to legislation or policies that might be inspired by the doctrine of the European Court of Human Rights , but under no circumstances are they obliged or compelled to do so by any judgment of the European Court of Human Rights .
After 30 years of free market fundamentalism , the global economy is facing the worst crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s .
Afghanistan currently has a corrupt , illegitimate government , there are innocent victims and the situation of women has not changed at all .
The country 's development and the development of agriculture , infrastructure and the commercial fabric urgently require a climate of peace and stability and , above all , the protection of citizens by combating impunity and the legal insecurity that directly affects them .
Such a solution must comply fully with the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .
However , due to the reasons we already know , I cannot .
We have to remind the European Union and the international organisation that sexual orientation is a matter falling within the remit of the individual right to privacy guaranteed by international human rights law , according to which equality and non-discrimination should be promoted , whilst freedom of expression should be guaranteed .
Mr President , in view of the present circumstances , I wonder whether it is worth visiting the country at this time .
It must continue to hold firm , very firm , in its tireless defence of freedom .
The amount spent by the United States increased from USD 67 million in 2009 to USD 167 million in 2010 .
It clearly shows that as far as Iraq is concerned - and I know that you do not want to talk about the past , but we have no option but to talk about the past - we are faced with a country that has been devastated , with more than 1 million people dead and 4 million homeless as a result of an illegal , unfair war based on lies .
The picture is therefore very gloomy .
I call on you to work quickly to withdraw the occupying forces as soon as possible .
In October , the Council agreed on general guidelines for the text on the right to interpreting and translation in criminal proceedings and one month later , in November , the Council adopted a plan to make progress on further measures regarding procedural guarantees , in response to Baroness Ludford 's call for action .
It was not possible to continue with the proposal tabled by the Commission and 13 Member States have replaced this initiative .
This draft initiative is already with Parliament and the first debate has already taken place .
We would like
