and to bring sustainable social stability .
My group will be running with and supporting this initiative in the autumn , and we are very grateful to you for organising the summit .
As a representative of the younger generation , I would urge all Member States in the Eurozone not to give up on their efforts to consolidate and to apply budgetary discipline in their national budgets .
Mr President , I would like to make it clear that we are not willing to allow the West to fall into the trap of allowing the Serbian constitution to make territorial claims on Kosovo and the Russians to say they will veto resolutions until Serbia agrees - which it will be unable to do because of the constitution approved by a dubious referendum .
This creates uncertainty , not transparency , and only engenders distrust . on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( DE ) Madam President , allow me also to congratulate you once again on your election yesterday and on your first session in the chair here in the Chamber .
At the same time , our common commitment to the poorest regions through the cohesion policy is the very thing that keeps the heart of the European Union beating .
This is not our first debate about disasters .
If the State is not there to help when it is urgently needed , and if it does not take action when the police are needed or the fire service is needed , citizens never forget .
I have one further comment : there will always be people in need - whether as a result of flooding or fire - unless we understand that it is not just about criminal elements .
Indeed , in the Committee on Legal Affairs we increasingly have the impression that the European Commission is misusing the instrument of soft law in order to circumvent Parliament 's codecision rights .
I also appeal to the social partners to do more for mobility in the various countries and to impose public controls to bring to light the black sheep and stop them from profiting from social dumping . on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I must say I am pleased that Commissioner McCreevy , in his answer to this oral question , did not reject the European Parliament 's suggestions .
That being so , I wish to make it very clear that if the Commission fails to deliver a substantive response on this issue within the stipulated time limit , I shall propose to the Committee on Legal Affairs that we take proceedings against it in the European Court for failure to act .
The draft amendment relates to the provision allowing Member States to lay down specific safety requirements and possibly also to prescribe the means of transport if they can justify it before the Commission .
We must slowly begin to wave the big stick . on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is a fact that harmful and risky alcohol consumption has a considerable health , economic and social impact .
On the contrary , people need to be informed as early as possible about the dangers of alcohol abuse .
Mr President , 2001-2007 has been six years of a politically motivated fight against terrorism .
The European public reads in today 's newspapers of the arrest of terrorists in Denmark who had made definite plans for attacks .
Terrorism is directed at our way of life , and therefore I should like to emphasise that combating it is a cultural challenge .
I should like to make one thing clear : secret prisons and extraditions to third countries where torture is carried out are also connected with the fight against terrorism , namely its moral dimension .
It is good to take a look back .
Thanks to political correctness , the indigenous peoples of Europe are all too easily labelled right-wing extremist or even racist for insisting on their basic culture , whilst migrants seldom face this problem .
Given the continuous rise in freight transport , the catastrophic lorry fire in the Gotthard Tunnel and similar occurrences will certainly not be the last horror stories about lorry accidents .
Human rights include the right of women to make decisions concerning their lives and reproduction free of discrimination , coercion and violence .
A holistic view is therefore essential .
However , I suspect that what is behind it is an attempt to call the provisions of Rome I into question once more .
For us , the protection of the interests of the consumer is the priority .
In that respect , perhaps I do want to see US conditions in Europe . on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , Commissioner , the sugar market regulation is not a showpiece of the Commission and Council !
We still have a great deal to do to make this target a reality .
Inspections are good , laws are even better !
It is downright absurd that carcinogenic substances are allowed to get into the hands of children .
There is one Member State in the Council boycotting a joint resolution of the European Union .
We need an answer to this , too .
Again , in my Group we are very happy that they are also included , but how do you want to link this to the other members , e.g . in Latin America , with whom we have free trade agreements ?
It was a very difficult piece of work , but you were always prepared to cooperate .
The rapporteurs have been working very well together .
