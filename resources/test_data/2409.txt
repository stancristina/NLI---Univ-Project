Bonde on behalf of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities .
It is also our view that MEPs ' travel expenses are a subject to be dealt with in connection with a reform of the Statute for Members .
Mr President , you promised when you were appointed , Commissioner Kinnock , that the Commission would become the world ' s best administration .
The issue of giving employees equal rights , irrespective of their sexual orientation , is a crucial step on the way .
In the last twelve years , there has been a very positive trend towards enabling homosexuals to be granted the same rights as heterosexuals .
In 1989 , my own country , Denmark , was the first country in the world to introduce legislation on registered partnerships for homosexuals , corresponding to marriage , and a number of other countries followed suit .
Other EU countries have implemented legislation which approximates to marriage to rather more limited degrees .
Allow me to mention four very important points .
On the legal basis of Article 13 of the Treaty , discrimination in the labour market on the grounds of sexual orientation has now been tackled in practical terms .
Finally , Parliament has recommended on several occasions that same-sex couples be guaranteed the same rights as heterosexual couples and that the Member States recognise registered partnerships .
Now is the time for the EU' s own institutions to comply with the same standards .
You have the key to nudging things in the right direction , Commissioner Kinnock .
This proposal would enable homosexuals to be accorded full rights if there were partnership legislation in their own countries .
I have a couple of questions in that connection .
Where will the Commission draw the line ?
That is progress , but I should like to ask whether the arrangement also covers cohabiting homosexuals in all the Member States .
Finally , a question on the timetable : when do you anticipate its being possible for these new staff rules to come into force in the institutions of the EU ?
They have , however , set things in motion .
I do not , however , think I need add anything else , irrespective of which language I might wish to use .
Madam President , the majority of my group were involved in securing your election in 1999 .
Previously , the post alternated between the two large groups , and within the large groups it alternated between the largest sub-groups .
It was also an outstanding Vice-President who could conduct the very difficult votes to the satisfaction of all MEPs .
The break with the major coalition has also made for a very good atmosphere in the Conference of Presidents .
Agreement and disagreement cross political divides .
In the past , your predecessors could look at Mrs Martens from the Group of the European People ' s Party and Mrs Green from the Group of the Party of European Socialists and , if these people looked down , the proposal was abandoned and , if they looked up , it was adopted .
The person concerned was only elected because it was a particular sub-group ' s turn to be given a titbit in terms of the administration of Parliament .
This happened even though Mrs Green was on that occasion opposed to the election of this person and then had nonetheless to vote in favour of it .
I should like to thank you for your cooperation in the far more open period that has just gone by .
May I also thank you personally , Madam President , for your resolute efforts on behalf of human rights on every occasion on which these have been an issue .
We can of course commend the appointment of the three wise men with their splendid careers behind them as a good signal to the Chinese leaders as to how we promote women and young people in the European Union .
My group expects the leaders of the future to be given places in the Convention , which it also expects to be opened up to that 50 per cent of the electorate who voted 'no ' in the referenda in France , Denmark and Ireland and who might have voted 'no ' in other countries if the latter had had the courage to ask them .
The Danish Prime Minister has already offered the Danish critics of the EU a place .
The two proposals can therefore be subject to consultative referenda in all the Member States so that our politicians can see what people want before they call an official Intergovernmental Conference for the purpose of making changes to existing treaties .
The two proposals should be prepared as completed drafts that can be adopted if desired .
The Convention should therefore do some detailed work and employ the necessary experts to help with both the majority and minority approaches .
The successor to the Treaty of Amsterdam must not come as a surprise but as the result of a democratic process .
I am extremely pleased that the Presidency has stood by enlargement and the whole programme of enlargement , that there is a continued commitment to concrete negotiations ' beginning as from 2002 and that we are aiming to admit the first new Member States in 2004 .
However , I do not understand the way in which the leadership of the Convention has been put together .
Where are the critics ?
Where are the critics ?
What has become of young people and , especially , women where this issue is concerned ?
When Mr Prodi was asked by Danish television what had become of women and young people , he called for honesty and said that , if the EU was to talk with government leaders , it needed men over the age of 30 .
