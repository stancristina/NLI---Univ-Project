in pursuing its objectives .
We need to be aware that this type of agriculture now accounts for an important share of the food market and of agricultural production in the European Union .
The report before us advocates the introduction of additional and enhanced measures with a view to eliminating these obstacles .
Anyone who is opposed to a gender war or to a quota policy or to confusing what is it to be in a minority with what it is to be a woman , is all the more duty-bound to fight for full respect for women’s unique role in society , in the family and as individuals , and for legal provisions to apply which give them genuine equality , while respecting the natural differences between all of us and in particular fully respecting something that is vital regardless of gender : individual liberty , and each person’s inalienable right to individual happiness .     This week we are celebrating International Women’s Day , which gives us an opportunity to take stock of the progress made at world level as regards women’s equality , liberty , development , recognition and participation in civic life .
I firmly believe that we should move on from mere political recognition to practical application in our day-to-day lives .
If British clinics are indeed offering high cash prices to Romanian women for their ova , not only are they encouraging people to turn the human body into a source of profit , which is prohibited and condemned under Article 3 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights , they are also indulging in sordid exploitation of the donors ’ weakness and poverty .
The danger represented by nuclear arms being acquired by pariah states not committed to international law and by terrorist groups cannot be compared with the acquisition of such arms by states which form part of the fabric of modern international relations , and it would not be reasonable to act as if the two were comparable .
This does not just involve condemning the attitude displayed by those who breach agreements , but also making every effort , as a matter of urgency , to get the North Korean and Iranian Governments to return to the negotiating table , failing which they will be subject to economic and political sanctions .
This resolution obscures the fundamental issue , the ‘cause of causes’ , that is to say the role of the United states and of Israel , which is in military occupation of Palestinian , Syrian and even Lebanese territory , in aggravating the situation in the Middle East .
I consider it essential , if this state of affairs is to be brought to an end , for the international community not to prevaricate in the face of those who subsidise , promote and incite terrorism .
Financing for the future programme is essential , but the final amount of the Union’s financial perspective is not yet known .
It will only be possible to create the European Research Area by increasing the EU’s financial support for research , in the context of improved coordination between European , national and regional research policies .
Establishing the European Research Area ( ERA ) is key here , as is achieving continuity in the planning of research programmes .
I would like to add another epithet : creative .
I voted in favour .     The preservation of biodiversity and the reversal of desertification are essential in ensuring sustainable development .
We therefore consider that the appropriations for rural development , which are intended to compensate farmers ’ additional costs , and those for the Structural Funds should be proportionately increased if the costs of managing Natura 2000 are to be found from these funds .
That is something for which we are directly responsible .
I voted in favour .     We are aware of allegations that the present arrangements for the sugar sector have distorted the market , leading to high prices for the consumer and a negative impact on the world market , particularly for developing countries .
Unfortunately , not all of these were adopted .     The motion for a resolution before us on the common organisation of the market in sugar was ultimately the result of a compromise which guarantees key national interests pending , in particular , the reduction in the size of the sugar beet market now underway in Portugal .
I voted in favour .     Mr President , Commissioner , the world finds itself in an era in which democratic values are being imposed across the globe .
I therefore believe that , politically speaking , Belarus has become one of the greatest problems we face within Europe , and in view of the gravity of this situation I believe that we should strengthen our support for civil society in that country in every possible way , and that we should also step up existing sanctions as far as possible .
Three of our fellow parliamentarians , Sam Rainsy , Cheam Channy and Chea Poch were subjected to loss of immunity in a particularly brutal way , by means of a show of hands , in a parliamentary session – if it can be called that – held behind closed doors , hidden from the public gaze and without any formal record of the proceedings .
It is not the first time that we have had to highlight the serious nature of the situation in Cambodia , and we should call on the Commission , the Council and on the Member States to be particularly clear about this at the forthcoming meeting on 10 and 11 March .
Cambodia , instead of offering us signs of hope and confidence in the future , is doing just the opposite .
