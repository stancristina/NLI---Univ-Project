If anybody wants to attach themselves to it , they must have the agreement of all the groups which have produced the text .
I would not say that the transcription was deliberately badly done in any case - that was only a possibility .
That was the problem .
At that time , comparisons were made .
Tomorrow , a new and equally important stage in the directive ' s development will begin , in which the European Parliament must continue to participate extremely actively in monitoring and controlling the fulfilment of objectives and deadlines and the drawing-up of reports or legislative acts derived from the directive .
Furthermore , they have carried out serious work on a highly complex subject .
Yes , some may still pollute their aquifers , but some have been polluting them for some time , for example with huge pig farms .
With regard to the translation problem , what Mrs Schleicher is referring to is a very important factor as the terminology is indeed highly technical in this field and a suitable translation is essential .
I am sure that the joint text represents a good balance between the need to guarantee a high level of environmental protection and the legitimate concerns of the various participants .
Once again , I congratulate all the speakers and in particular the rapporteur , Mr Florenz , on the work carried out .
In conclusion , I would like to emphasise the importance of efficient management in the aviation industry in reducing pollutants , placing the emphasis on improving airport management and clearly supporting the creation of a single European sky , by means of which we would also undoubtedly contribute to reducing environmental pollution .
We must try to reconcile interests that are not always easy to reconcile as air transport undoubtedly involves economic interests that are characterised by high investment costs which require a long life span before they are paid off .
I know this message is not well received in many parts of the sector but , without a doubt , in the medium and long term there is no solution but to look for an alternative unless we want air transport to become a victim of its own success .
On many occasions , we have indicated our preference for an international solution to these problems , and the Commission has noted with satisfaction the positive development of the United States ' stance in relation to the standardisation process that is taking place in the ICAO.
The fact that practically all manufacturers and producers in all the Member States have removed the products we are now trying to remove indicates that there are now many mature areas in which ideally we would not have to establish legislation , and would not find ourselves in situations like this .
We should ask the question whether those who are working in the hidden economy , working on the black market or , to use the most common term , carrying out undeclared work , really have an adequate job ?
Before , the motto of sport was that of Pierre de Coubertin , 'the important thing is taking part ' .
Combating intentional or planned doping is much more difficult .
Thus , when buying a drug , sportsmen and women will be able to clearly see the red traffic light indicating the risk of testing positive , or the green light which indicates that there is no risk , or the amber light indicating that there may be a risk and that they should contact their doctor or a specialist for advice .
They talk of sport as a citizen' s right , with a social and cultural function .
Therefore , I think that the Commission should act .
Therefore , keep going , Commissioner .
Ladies and gentlemen , we need to reinvent sport , because as it is at the moment there is a battle for glory , but also for money and sponsorship .
I think that it is important that the Commission and the Council demand that this submarine goes back to the United Kingdom and that they ensure that safety standards are complied with .
But the problem is that the safety standards include emergency plans and special action for the population within a radius of ten kilometres , which in this case means around 200 000 people .
We would also like to express our concern - as other speakers have done - because , unfortunately , the matter that we were to discuss , that of the very serious , terrible and fatal accident of the submarine Kursk has led us to deal with the problem of a nuclear submarine in Mediterranean waters , in European Union territory , in a British colony .
In this case , there has been a violation of Community law .
Mr President , the subject for today is 'Nuclear submarine accidents ' .
Therefore , the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party supports the proposals of the corresponding resolution and , in particular , I would like to draw attention to paragraph 8 , which asks that both the United States and the Commission and the Council impose the appropriate political and economic sanctions as long as there is no process of democratisation in Burma .
In a situation of this kind , the attempt to establish peace zones , for example through the peace communities established in the rural region of Urabá , has faced great difficulties .
But the fact is that , since 1997 , there have been three murders , the most recent on 8 July of this year , and the Peace Community of La Unión and the Intercongregational Committee for Justice and Peace , including the Irish Franciscan priest Brendan Forde , have had repeated death threats , despite their position of remaining neutral and contributing to bringing peace to the
