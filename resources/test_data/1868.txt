whole , I look forward to a situation in which people with a disability , just like people without a disability , can have access to the medium of the Internet without any problems .
The fact is that this is FYROM , and let us adhere to this .
Mr President , I have naturally voted in favour of the Brok report , but I regret that the results and the recommendations of the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities have not been incorporated in the report itself but have merely crept in via amendments .
We should realise that half of the people in the candidate countries are women .
.
A large accession wave in 2004 is therefore becoming increasingly less likely .
I am delighted that amendments underlining the absolute priority of the political criteria have been adopted along the lines of my own amendments adopted by the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs to its opinion .
Many of these difficulties are money-related .
Public opinion is right to be indignant about the many vulnerable road users who are the victim of road traffic that kills .
This is also why we need to call for alternatives for these children who now have to work , not least in the interest of the developing countries .
They furnish the proof that child labour is still the order of the day in the production of sports equipment .
The production of sports equipment is certainly not the only , and not even the most important , sector in which children work .
But I am left with questions .
Such reconstruction will not take place .
Over the course of two elections , we have joined forces with the OSCE team in Minsk in a very pleasant and effective partnership .
Its former head of mission and great driving force , Mr Hans-Georg Wieck , has given a thumbnail description of this commitment : observation of the human rights situation and administration of justice in Belarus , legal assistance for the affected families , reporting of processes and interventions in cases of violations of the law , humanitarian aid to victims of state persecution on political grounds and by administrative and criminal penalties , development of the range of action and cooperation of political parties , the forming of a coalition of parties and social forces , observation of elections , also involving the local population , and finally , projects reinforcing civil society .
The attendant system , however , is very different from what one would expect from a civilised and leading industrial nation .
Control at European airports and outposts is minimal and should be stepped up drastically , preferably along American lines .
Many supporters travel to that destination .
Well , first of all , a great many flights from the capitals to Strasbourg have been scrapped .
In principle , driving bans , in whatever form , constitute an infringement of this freedom .
We are trying to solve this by imposing notification duty in respect of new driving bans to the European Commission under the said conditions .
This is therefore not about harmonising driving times .
Most amendments that have been tabled by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism form a constructive addition to the Commission proposal .
Thanks to these amendments , Member States can determine at their own discretion whether or not they wish to impose driving bans , rather than via comitology within the European Commission , as has hitherto been the case .
A general expansion of weekend driving bans is a very sensitive issue in our group .
As far as the rapporteur 's Amendments Nos 4 and 13 are concerned , in which topographical reasons are given to justify driving bans , these are not acceptable to my group .
If some companies had their way , it would be possible to drive without any time restrictions , during the day , at night , during weekends and on bank holidays .
However , I would prefer to see the fast transport of perishable agricultural products , to which he gives due consideration , transferred to the railways , and for that reason , I do not endorse his proposal for a derogation .
However , with a view to enlargement , a framework for new driving-time bans is possible .
On this basis , preventive measures would be possible to improve safety .
I am saying this against the interests of my country and those of its transport sector .
One of the things that should be considered is how we can make vegetable biodiesel even more effective .
We take the view that this should be maintained for the time being .
I therefore consider an integral environmental impact study to be necessary in order to remove the doubts that exist in connection with the use of biofuels .
If we can achieve this , then we will have made a huge step forward .
And I would add that my country , among others , does not score very well at all in this matter .
We can only applaud this .
It is clear , however - and the European Parliament has referred to this in previous reports - that the Member States are having to contend with various handicaps .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , following our appeal for a improved distribution of European film , we are now turning to the legal aspects we could employ to promote it .
Secondly , I should like to remind you that as long as we do not know what the public want , we cannot adopt a targeted promotion policy for the European film .
We should therefore find a solution to the problems related to funding and implementation .
