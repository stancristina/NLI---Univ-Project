incidentally none of those mentioned by Mr Evans .
I very much hope that more members of the EPP/ED Group will support this report .
Mr President , what has not been stressed sufficiently thus far in the debate I believe is democracy and subsidiarity .
Many of the atrocities in the Balkans that we spoke of earlier and much of the racism and antisemitism is because communities everywhere have not been allowed the ability , in line with the concept of subsidiarity , to develop within their own communities the democracy that people need everywhere if they are to evolve and create within their own regions and nations , the social rights , justice , respect for minorities , coexistence of different people and respect for every race and people .
Article 3b of the Maastricht Treaty , President , still confines subsidiarity to the relationship between the European Union and the Member States .
Regions and stateless nations are ignored .
People within their own communities therefore suffer .
They are unable to establish the structures they need so that human rights can prosper and the blight of racism can be forever removed .
In own nation , Wales , for example , we have no empowerment to establish our own laws to counter racism and defend human rights .
The principles of cohesion and the drive to limit poverty and depravity in our communities are a well-settled concept in the European Union .
However , it must encompass respect for minorities everywhere if it to inspire the world in its drive towards defeating racism and defending human rights .
Madam President , can the Commission confirm that it has accepted Amendment No 1 by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy ?
This would mean that the directive could be adopted by a qualified majority , and we would then be able to lay the directive to rest .
Belgians and French people would then be able to enjoy British chocolate as much as the British have enjoyed French and Belgian chocolate .

Mr President , I taste sweet victory for British chocolate producers in our vote today in their fight to have good British chocolate recognised across Europe as the delicious , high-quality product that it is .
The victors are not just British chocolate makers but chocolate consumers right across Europe who will now be free to wallow in the delight of Dairy Milk , Galaxy and Milky Way at will .
Clear labelling will enable consumers to choose and enjoy the chocolate that they want .
Their taste buds will no longer be deprived by Europe 's chocolate police .
Developing countries are also the victors .
This legislation takes account of the needs of the world 's poorest farmers .
Those vegetable fats permitted will be of tropical origin , and there will also be a review of the impact of the directive after three years .
Best of all , the directive will increase chocolate sales overall , thereby increasing the market for developing countries ' exports .
So chocoholics can now munch safe in the knowledge they are doing their bit for the Third World .
I am sure you will agree that the EU , in the past , has got itself into a right Twix on this matter .
Some governments have got their Snickers in a twist trying to protect their chocolate industries .
For them , however , Crunchie time has come and they now have Creme Egg on their faces .
It is high time the European Parliament gave two Cadbury 's Fingers to the chocolate snobs .
- Madam President , I wholeheartedly support Europe 's moves to become an eco-friendly continent .
This measure is yet further proof of the EU 's commitment to greening up its act .
Since 1992 , the Euro-Flower logo has become a hallmark of environmentally-friendly products , ranging from washing machines to writing paper .
However , consumers ' enthusiasm for green goods has yet to be matched by industry .
The measures contained in this 3-year strategy , however , should hopefully bring manufacturers on board .
In the fight to clean up our planet , Britain 's Labour Government has , of course , been at the forefront
