The fight against terrorism is much more difficult and needs to be tackled in a much greater variety of ways .
Commissioner Bolkestein has just shown this through his speech .
Following the raid , the Belgian police did not actually bring any specific charges .
I should also like to ask the European Commission whether it knew about this in advance and , if so , who in the Commission was aware of the matter .
OLAF’s director chose not to inform the Commission in time .
What is evident is that the problems involving fraud and irregularities have not disappeared .
It is also about system errors .
In this case , increased control is not what is in the first place required .
What is required is for the system to be done away with as quickly as possible .     – Mr President , I wish to tell the Commissioner that I am looking forward to meeting him tomorrow in order to exchange experiences and points of view concerning the social agenda .
That is because it is sometimes difficult to make one’s way to Strasbourg because of the lack of air connections .
Mr Pérez Álvarez and Mr  Hughes have been the leading figures in this cooperation .
It has already been said that this directive is part of the health and safety and physical agents package .
It is an important directive on which we now have to adopt a position .
Another important subject is , of course , prevention : that is to say , when an employee suffers overexposure , he should have an automatic right to health checks .
I must also mention the last amendment to the effect that there is a deadline before which the Commission must respond .
I am convinced it will be .     Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we are now close to the end of almost five years of work on trying to obtain safer food in Europe .
Mr Schnellhardt and I have , of course , had different views on certain technical issues when it comes to both his and my reports , which have a lot in common with each other in certain areas .
We shall support the compromise , if not wholeheartedly .
A compromise depends , however , upon both give and take by the parties concerned .
Otherwise , we support these recommendations and are very pleased that we have reached this agreement .
I should like to state that those of us who have worked on it have , in general , done some skilful and persistent work to make food safer .
Thank you for your cooperation .     Mr President , for us , the European Commission ’s proposal in this area is completely unacceptable .
It is this insight that is the very basis of the rules to be adopted .
That applies not only to journey times .
Strict rules regarding this point are positive above all in terms of the animals ’ well-being , but also because they will favour local abattoirs and the development of mobile abattoirs .
It means direct support for comprehensive cruelty to animals , with very long journey times .
Refunds for the export of livestock from the EU should instead be completely abolished as quickly as possible .     Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner Patten , the nightmare in the Middle East seems never to end .
Two states – recognised by one another , democratic and existing side by side – would naturally have an enormously positive effect on stability throughout the region .
We need political will , a desire really to sit down , negotiate and achieve peace .
Assassination may appear logical from a military point of view , but it is the worst of diplomatic means .
Nonetheless , we cannot accept this type of killing .
Arafat must emphasise that it is not Hamas that is setting the agenda .
The ELDR Group cannot be too emphatic in its condemnation of the suicide bombers .
Israel and Palestine must return to the negotiating table and to the Quartet’s Road Map .
Walls can never be the solution .
The collapse of the Arab League summit is tragic , but there is yet hope that reference will still be made to human rights and democracy , which are the places from which we have to begin .
Why , as General Morillon said , are there , however , only words and pious wishes ?
Why does the Council not listen to Parliament ?
Moreover , we are concerned here with trade policy pure and simple .
Why no action ?
How are we to have a peaceful world order , based upon law and justice , if tough punishment is meted out to certain lawbreakers – especially if they are Arab Muslims – while another lawbreaker , Israel , appears to be able to do whatever it likes , and all that occurs is that we repeat the same debate year after year after year without anything happening ?
No terrorist acts can be approved .
The EU must not accept this .
Agreements must be complied with by both parties .
Further indulgence of Israel and the Israeli Government does not help Israel .     Mr President , Commissioner , we are about to see the approval of a framework for our food packaging .
I hope we succeed .
In the future too , packages will on many occasions have to be expressly approved in the light of the particular substances and food they are to be used for .
A majority in Parliament appears to be prepared to accept active packaging , that is to say packaging that can absorb oxygen and moisture in the environment or give off antioxidants .
I personally prefer active packaging around my bread .
One of the conditions of our approving
