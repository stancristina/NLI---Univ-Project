dimension involved , mean that everything possible has to be done to keep the company afloat .
He also points out that various investigations into the precise cause of the disaster , and into the question of who was responsible for it , are still in progress .
Fines are not enough to deal with this ; no longer must it be possible to pay them out of the petty cash .
That is not the position taken by the main Committee , which proposes that the plenary should send a message to the Commission , the Council , the participants in the market and also to the supplying and producing countries by dealing with the issue in a new and different way , turning the proposal upside down and - let me say this with particular clarity - refraining from creating a category of dirigiste European actions .
It seems likely that we will shortly reach the limits of the world 's capacity for supplying oil .
Today , we take relatively low prices for gas and oil for granted , but I believe that , now that shortages are becoming apparent - and oil and gas prices have trebled in recent years - locally-produced renewable energy sources will become a much more competitive proposition .
This is not , though , about the Commission acquiring additional competences in order to influence prices and perhaps retain its own capacity for intervention .
I do not therefore think that there is anything further to be added to what he had to say .
There were those who said that , by opening up the market , we were jeopardising the security of energy supply ; are we not now proving that they were right ?
What this means is that costs are running high and the benefit to us is relatively small , so I would like to say that I agree with my fellow-Members that this is perhaps not the right road to take .
In this election , your fellow-candidates would be those to whom you have been listening - Mr Beysen , Mr Langen , Mr Kronberger , Mr Rapkay , Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel , and Mr Linkohr - and the only person who would vote for you would be none other than Mr Caudron .
The fact is that there is no stopping either time or the applications already in the pipeline .
He has convinced the members of the committee not only of his personal integrity and professional competence , but also of his views on economic and monetary policy in the Eurozone .
What role , then , can and should central banks play in order to contribute to financial stability , to avoid financial crises and to provide assistance ?
Only last week , at our study days in Madrid , we redefined and laid down once again the crucial points of our policy .
In all his answers , he has thus clearly recognised and affirmed our principles as the correct ones .
I think that would take us much further forward .
The inventor has invested time and money in his invention , and it is of course quite unacceptable for the state to stand and watch while others exploit his ideas commercially .
In fact , what we tried to do was to avoid the massive lobbying and find some neutral and objective legal experts who could explain this very complex subject matter to us .
It is laudable that Europe is showing responsibility here , but taking the first step on the basis of the European Patent Convention would have been enough , and then we could have given the matter further thought .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , a directive which regulates the uniform application of the law by patent offices and patent tribunals is to be welcomed unreservedly in the interests of a well-functioning internal market and for the sake of avoiding distortions of competition .
After weighing up all the pros and cons of this directive , however , I am convinced that we will make the right decision tomorrow if we adopt this directive with the amendments proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and various other clarifications .
I had to be in my constituency early this morning , which is not far away - around 150 km - and would have arrived in time for the vote had it not been for the demonstrations that were being held in front of the building .
Promoting stability in Europe and encouraging sustainable economic development - these are the further priorities for new initiatives in 2004 .
At the same time , we can be certain that all the new Member States will be net recipients .
At the same time , we know that the Council is watching to make sure that there is no widening of the gap here .
During this budgetary procedure , we will therefore be proposing that the campaign against VAT fraud be stepped up in order to ease the burden on the ordinary taxpayer , so that the money that should be flowing to Europe can actually do so .
Fourthly , in the budgetary procedure , we will ensure that enlargement is shaped on the basis of certainty .
Yet we spend just 37 billion on development .
We must deal with this situation by shaping it positively .
This is one reason why the Commission greatly regrets the way in which the Council has cut the funding for the Commission 's delegations , which play an ever-greater part in implementing the Budget .
Although the priority will still be the fight against poverty , the needs of the ACP States in particular require of us that we adopt a coherent policy approach .
