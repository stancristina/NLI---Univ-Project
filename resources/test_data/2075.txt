Our central message to the Turkish government must be extremely clear on this point : immediate measures are required to avoid more casualties .
I also agree with what Mr Swoboda said about the importance of looking at the political system which produces a prison system of the kind found in Turkey .
The Council will continue to present itself very clearly to the Turkish government .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , at the end of February Albanian extremists took control of the village of Tanusevci on the border between Kosovo and the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia ( FYROM) , which caused violent clashes between extremists and FYROM' s army and police force .
There is clearly a risk of out and out civil war , and the European Union has worked hard to prevent such a development .
The FYROM government was urged to act with restraint against the extremists , and the leaders of the major Albanian parties were urged to openly distance themselves from and isolate the extremists , while the Slavic-Macedonian opposition parties were urged not to exploit the situation to whip up nationalistic feelings against the Albanian minority .
The following day , an EU Troika of political directors travelled with Dr Solana to Skopje , and at the end of the same week the EU Troika of foreign ministers travelled with Dr Solana to Skopje and Pristina to emphasise their support for the government and their condemnation of the extremists ' actions .
In order to underpin the political support financially , a review was carried out of the EU' s aid to FYROM for this year .
Intensive work was done by both the Commission and the EU Member States to , for example , make up the financial deficit for the new university in Tetovo , offering teaching in Albanian , and to try to rapidly implement measures to rebuild houses destroyed in the villages north of Tetovo and support other projects to strengthen inter-ethnic cohesion in the country .
Like other countries in the western Balkans , FYROM is currently seen as a potential candidate for EU membership .
So far , all that has been achieved is avoiding a declaration of a state of war , postponing the public census until October and setting a date of 27 January 2002 for new parliamentary elections .
In the medium term , and ahead of next year ' s election , the government must also make the necessary constitutional changes to even out the differences between the position of the Slavic-Macedonian population and that of other minorities in the country , and also take the action necessary to strengthen the representation of the minorities within the administration .
In other words , FYROM is facing a difficult but necessary process of reform , and time is running out if a new civil war is to be avoided .
In the period up to the end of June , the coalition government will need support and encouragement , as well as the exercise of pressure , to be able to implement the necessary reforms and , at the same time , keep the fragile government coalition intact .
The injustices which women suffer throughout their lives continue when they get older .
Women' s right to their own income and so to financial independence is extremely important .
Joint taxation in many Member States and a lack of childcare and care for the elderly are a couple of reasons why many women are unable to enter or stay in the labour market .
A more even division of responsibility for the home and family could lay the foundation for more equality in the workplace and a labour market of equal opportunities and equal pay for equal work .
Much has been said about solidarity and security .
This is exactly what should be addressed with regard to pensions .
In my home country , Sweden , we have already started to adapt to this type of change , and a considerable part of our future pension system will be linked to a supplementary pension based on what happens on the financial markets .
Most of all , perhaps , there is a worry that it will be unreliable .
Several speakers , including Mrs Jensen and Mrs Van Lancker , have pointed out that women are a particularly vulnerable group , and in many countries I believe that women could lose out in the system now being introduced .
This may work in certain countries as they currently have a relatively low retirement age , at least for certain categories of pensioner .
In this situation it is foolish and inhuman to try to force people to remain in the labour market .
I would also point out that the Commission has stated that it may approve an extension of the current organisation of the sugar markets beyond 1 July 2003 on condition that all the other parts of its reform proposal are approved by the Council .
With regard to sugar , full liberalisation of trade will apply from 1 July 2009 .
This is a sensitive issue for many Member States .
The ' Eurogroup ' is an informal body set up in 1998 on the basis of a resolution on economic policy coordination in stage 3 of EMU.
The European Council in Nice in December last year welcomed the improvements made to the workings of the Eurogroup and its visibility .
It also welcomed the intention to extend the range of mainly structural matters dealt with in this forum , with due regard for the conclusions of the Luxembourg European Council meeting , i .e . that the Eurogroup be informal and without any decision-making powers .
In some ways it is positive if it is saying that the Eurogroup does not make
