greater attention to relations with it .
I am very far from satisfied with the statement by the Council and the Commission , which really has nothing new to offer .
The European Parliament also , under our Partnership Agreement , has developed its own framework for in-depth dialogue with the Ukrainian Parliament .
Nor is it acceptable that not only opposition politicians , but also independent civil society initiatives should be subject to increasingly repressive measures .
I have confidence in the people of Ukraine , but I also call on the Presidency and the Commission to ensure that support for democratic structures and , above all , for civil society is accorded a central role in the action plan , and is given higher priority than economic development , as the development of democracy in Ukraine still stands on shaky ground , and must be consolidated .     .
Our activities relate precisely to the promotion of civil society for which Mrs Schroedter called , and indeed we have achieved a number of successes in this field .
I have just one additional question ; you referred to monitoring , which , if I understood you correctly , will be carried out primarily by the Association Council .
The efforts of the actors at European and national level to combat poverty among women and what you have termed the feminisation of poverty may be observed in the context of the open method of coordination in the field of social inclusion .
It is also aware that poverty is one of the principal reasons and causes underlying the trafficking in women and other forms of sexual exploitation .
We on the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality demand that these points be incorporated in future major projects on the European social model , in the Progress programme , in the Structural Funds and in the new employment guidelines .
While it would be worthwhile to consider many of the points made , I would like to highlight two of them , one being the connection between the European Budget , agricultural expenditure and poverty – including among women – in the developing world .
We would very much like to know whether it is aware that the United States has already dismantled stationary sonar systems of this kind .
We therefore ask you to note that the completion of the study will require some considerable time .
This is clearly in breach of Article 51 of the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Convention .
I personally take the view – as I believe does the majority in my group – that we should implement this moratorium , which makes sense and is necessary , and I can only say that we should very definitely make an issue of the use of cluster munitions in Chechnya , as Russia is a member state of the Council of Europe , which sits here in Strasbourg .
It would appear that the increasing number of reports of death sentences being imposed is only the tip of the iceberg .
It is of course out of the question for us to accept such a state of affairs .
I deliberately say against terrorists and all kinds of terrorism , as I object to references to ‘terrorism’ , which imply that this is a uniform phenomenon and suggest a mistaken view of the world .
I also see it as very important that these rules should cover not only sales , but also their mediation and brokerage .
At a time when the People’s Republic of China is threatening Taiwan with the use of armed force , lifting the arms embargo would send completely the wrong message .
We have every basis in law for doing this , provided by SFOR , that is , by the military intervention that made this advance , this stabilisation , possible after ten years .
All these things considered , I welcome the report and assure you that the Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats will vote in favour of it .     Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , if we want a better future , we do well constantly to recall the past .
Is there an ethical context , and where , when and by whom are offences to be punished ?
The Community aid provided for in this regulation can and should help to achieve greater compliance with the , in order to prepare for the takeover which will be necessary after a solution to the Cyprus issue has been found , and indeed one of the primary aims of this financial support instrument is to promote such a solution .
South-Eastern Europe and the Agency’s future tasks are of too great an importance for the EU to allow the future of the European Agency for Reconstruction to remain unclear .
This rapprochement can also support change in both parts of the island .
It was decided in the Council that 1 April of next year would be the latest possible date for the transition to majority voting and codecision in the areas of immigration and asylum policy and in other areas of justice and internal cooperation .
Let me reiterate that if we want to combat illegal immigration – and it has for some time been one of my group ’s articles of faith that we do – we must at last create the possibility of legal immigration .
I will tell them that we did not merely create empty institutions , but such bodies as the European Human Rights Agency , endowed with funding and a mandate .
What Europe achieves is frustrated in the Council , and what ought to be done by the nation states does not get done .
What about a Week of the Constitution , in which all the Member States would ratify it
