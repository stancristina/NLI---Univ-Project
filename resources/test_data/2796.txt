It is also entirely wrong that PHARE funding should be used in Slovakia to buy history books containing xenophobic comments , and it is regrettable that the Council will not give me an answer to my questions .
I should be grateful for an answer from your office by tomorrow at the latest .
I should like to make four points about the report by Mr Papakyriazis , which I very much welcome and on which I congratulate him .
Mr Ombudsman , you said in your report that some 65 % of the complaints submitted were outside your remit .
What are they doing to let people know about their fundamental right to submit complaints ?
He is not responsible for maintaining the institutional balance , and it is also too much to expect him to detail every single complaint in his report .
And secondly , we must make it clear that the extension of the Union 's responsibilities , including those under the third pillar which concern people 's basic rights , should mean an extension of the powers of the Ombudsman as well .
First , the indents give details of all the European legislation on consumer protection and the protection of minors with which commercial communication must comply , including the Internet , because what is illegal off-line is just as illegal on-line .
I was also very surprised to see that the Greens , the Europe of Nations Group and the Socialists all submitted amendments with precisely the same wording , and I wonder whether it is just a coincidence that it is also the exact wording proposed by the BEUC , the European Consumers Organization , in its letter of 8 July .
Under these circumstances , controls by the country of destination are permitted , and harmonization is the only way to achieve freedom of movement .
As Christian Democrats , we feel that the new spirit shown in the Amsterdam Treaty concerning the European Union 's respect for religious beliefs and the principle of non-discrimination should also be fully reflected in future directives in this field , and we will support any amendments to that effect .
Mr President , cross-border commercial communication is a difficult phenomenon , and the rapporteur has mentioned the obstacles which service providers in this sector face in trying to cover the whole of the internal market .
Every Member State has its own rules and regulations on admissibility for commercial communication .
Furthermore , such a patent would inevitably have a very broad scope when it comes to new applications using the gene in question .
So far , Parliament has failed to recognize the growth in the biotechnology industry by providing it with the proper patent legislation it needs for economic support , and after nine years we have still not achieved harmonization at European level .
That is why my group intends to vote for this excellent report by Mr Rothley and the patents directive .
As far as the review is concerned , I think that the Commission has produced a good report .
I am anxious to see the new proposal from the Commission , but this review has at least made me feel more confident about it .
It is an extremely effective means of obliging operators to do their best to treat their customers well , knowing that it is relatively easy for them to switch to another operator .
It is not in the interest of consumers , and it protects major operators who charge high costs for long-distance calls while at the same time benefiting from their competitive advantages in continental Europe .
I also think that consumers should be quite clear about whether they are using freephone numbers or numbers for which they will be charged .
I think that the main point is to clarify the idea of special network access and how it should be interpreted .
The introduction of number portability should take account of new technological developments which are leading to the convergence of telecommunications and informatics , and the continuing integration of these various technologies must not be hindered by too much or too little legislation .
Number transferability is essential for the smooth operation of the internal market and will in fact promote competition in the telecommunications sector .
The Commission at first was somewhat reluctant to accept that part of the staff would be found by redeployment in the course of 1998 .
Firstly , I wish to compliment the rapporteur for 1998 , Mr Tillich , because that is a very important new development .
From the point of view of the Committee on Budgets , we should return to the preliminary draft budget .
Both of us are now working much more closely together .
We also reaffirmed our support for the view expressed on many occasions in the House that there should be no cuts in agricultural premiums , which was therefore not merely a decision by the Council of Ministers , but also the decision of the House itself .
A total increase of one million on a budget of ECU 41 billion is hardly excessive , I believe , and we therefore feel that the Committee on Budgets does not have the right to change many of the Committee on Agriculture 's technical priorities .
The Tillich report also proposes a new kind of reserve containing more than ECU 300 million , so that surpluses under certain agricultural headings are kept available for other headings which have been cut .
Madam President , as a former Member of the Dutch Parliament , I well remember the day we heard that the German Government was planning to introduce a user charge , and the growing tide of heavy goods vehicles heading east would slowly but surely have to pay for the privilege .
The talks we
