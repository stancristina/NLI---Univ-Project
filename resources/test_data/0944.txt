.
The Brazilian Government is endeavouring to introduce social and ecological standards in this area , and we should be supporting it in that .
Ten years ago , we were demanding the lifting of directive 86 on the equal treatment of self-employed men and women and the spouses who help them out .
It is farmers , across the length and breadth of Europe , who both ensure that nature is accessible to all and produce healthy food .
They will be adopting an anti-secession law , intended to back up a possible military strike against Taiwan .
If the Chinese want to go on living together with the Tibetans – a possibility to which the Dalai Lama has referred – then it is they who must take the first and crucial step and gain the trust of the Tibetan people – something they can do only by acknowledging and defending their right of self-determination , their own culture and religion and their rights as human beings .
I would ask the other groups to lend their support to our amendment , whereby we may be able to do something for young people from Belarus , where , we agree , democracy and the rule of law must be advanced , and the nation states must at last awake from their torpor .     .
Something else I want to address is the position of workers who are not Saudi nationals .
I would now just like to know whether we can assume that the Council will do likewise and involve Parliament in the decision on this matter , or whether we can take it as read that the Member States will stick with their proposal in the full knowledge that they are setting themselves against three institutions .
I am thinking here of air passengers ’ data and the debate on the collection of telecommunications data .
We aim for equal protection and for harmonisation .
That was – and still is – the view taken by the Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats .
I would also like to thank the Commission , even though , on some points , we sometimes occupied positions at some distance from one another , and also the Council , despite the fact that the final result we have so far – with its various stages – gives me but little satisfaction .
We brought the calendar week back ; that has been agreed on .
The Council did come up with a proposal on break times that I thought was a good one ; although it was amended by the Committee , I regard the result as a workable variant .
I would therefore like to call on the Council – which is not present , but will perhaps read this later on – to get a move on ; we want this regulation and we want this directive , but not at any price .
The ‘three and a half tonne question ’ was a major issue .
Let me add , Commissioner , that we are not talking here about the delivery of pizzas , for a pizza , if it is transported – as the Committee on Transport and Tourism has suggested – for over 60 kilometres , will be cold and inedible !
This naturally means that they are under a great deal of pressure , and measures must be taken at EU level to protect them , just as measures must be taken to protect other road users from tired drivers .
I agree with Mr Piecyk that they too pose a risk , but we must not forget the bureaucracy and costs that would be involved if the rules on tachographs and suchlike were also to apply to these types of commercial vehicle .
It will also be necessary to ensure compliance with driving and rest periods .
As far as the motorways of the sea are concerned , we only wish to support projects that are useful and workable , and our primary aim must be to ensure that new funding does not have a harmful impact on existing ferry and feeder links .
We stress very emphatically that confidence in the stability of the European currency is the basis for the confidence of Europeans among themselves and in the process of European unification .
On that we are absolutely agreed .
These are global challenges and there is no France , Germany , Great Britain , Belgium or Portugal which can face them alone .
It seems questionable to me whether it will be able to effectively play its part as guardian of the pact .
One point which I should still like to mention in conclusion is research and development .
Seventy thousand people demonstrated in Brussels in March against the brutality of the neoliberal project .
However , I am convinced that it was a very difficult birth and that the outcome is anything but satisfactory .
Now we shall manage it .
There is discrimination against Croatia , a central European country which meets the criteria better than many a Member State .
In these negotiations , Parliament’s delegation went to the pain threshold .
I again expressly thank individual members for their initiative in supporting this proposal concerning the timely shutdown of Kozloduj .     – Mr President , I should like to speak out against this proposal on behalf of my group .
We would also like the Bureau to explain the electoral legislation to us .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , today finds us , for the first time in the EU’s history , voting on whether to welcome a country into the EU 20 months before the planned accession date – a country , moreover , in which serious violations of human rights and democratic standards are committed , as became apparent from yesterday’s debate .
