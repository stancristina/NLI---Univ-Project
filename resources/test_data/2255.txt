operations , but - via the Argo Programme - we co-financed these external border management operations to the tune of EUR 670 000 .
Our proposal is to create three permanent control centres for our southern maritime border .
The question that I raised , therefore , stands : do you not think , Commissioner , that it would be useful to listen to those whom you did not previously consider to be credible ?
It is haemorrhaging fuel oil and we do not really know what it contains .
Mr President , 40 million European citizens are affected by some type of disability , but these individuals ' full participation in society is not yet a reality because they still suffer prejudice and lack fundamental rights in terms of access to education , to gainful employment , to information and communication , as well as difficulties in access to the built environment and to transport .
I wish to take this opportunity to recall that the organisations representing disabled persons must participate fully in the drafting of this convention , and in defining and assessing all the measures intended for them .
The problem faced by disabled citizens is the way in which principles of equality and non-discrimination are applied , in other words , the problems in accessing the rights of full citizenship also faced by people who are discriminated against on any other grounds .
We also hope that it will then think not only about the legislative initiatives that must be taken at international and Member-State level , but also about those that the Commission itself will be taking .
We could , therefore , say that this proposal for DAPHNE II is in line with the discussions we held at that time : an increase in financial and human resources and more sharing of information and best practice , amongst other aspects .
Since the time that this proposal was presented to Parliament , the needs associated with the European Union 's enlargement have been taken into account with regard to all Commission instruments and , as you can see in the proposal for the 2004 budget , the sum currently earmarked for the DAPHNE II Programme stands at EUR 49.2 million for the period 2004-2008 .
The aim of this is to increase the programme 's impact on the groups involved .
Priority must be given to policies for social integration , we must invest in educating people about equality , we must increase resources and materials and also legislation that protects and promotes the social integration of victims , that throws rapists out of their homes and that helps to create a new mindset which respects the dignity of women and children .
The second phase of the programme must consequently be able to help out with more projects to combat violence , whilst taking account of the realities of a Europe of 25 Member States .
We cannot waste time on protracted negotiations in conciliation .
We acknowledge that this programme must be accepted to be a priority and this is why we ourselves proposed that its funding be more than doubled in comparison to the DAPHNE I Programme ; we believe that EUR 50 million will enable us to manage the programme properly and carefully but we understand the differences of opinion that exist in the House on this matter .
We should leave this to the discretion of the Management Committee .
Lastly , I wish to make an observation on the issue of the European database .
We are consequently all the more disappointed and indignant , because the Cuban regime has betrayed and rejected our good faith and has dashed our hopes of seeing positive developments in the Cuban regime , expressed in particular through the attempt at openness made by a delegation at the beginning of the year and in the visit to Cuba made by Commissioner Nielson , also at the beginning of the year .
Mr President , we are currently experiencing a particularly worrying economic and social situation and , despite all the declarations about the priority that should be given to social policy , the reality of the situation shows that unemployment and the standard of living are growing worse for a significant proportion of the population .
This is why , in our proposals , we insist on the need for the Stability Pact to be revised .
This is due to budget under-implementation , particularly in the Structural Funds .
.
Consequently , without calling into question the principle of relative stability , we must ensure that these unused quotas can be used by the fleets of other Member States .
( PT ) As this wide-ranging study has revealed , Europe is suffering from a shortfall in qualified national seafarers , given the scale of Europe 's maritime transport .
If , as has been suggested on many occasions , we need to promote and improve maritime transport , replacing in particular long-distance and heavy goods transport by road , an action programme to promote the maritime profession must be implemented .
.
( PT ) I have voted in favour of this report .
In conclusion , I welcome the adoption of the amendments to which I put my name , as did Mrs Muscardini and Mrs Angelilli , on encouraging the adoption of filters and techniques for registering and tracing activity , to prevent the dissemination of paedophile material on the Internet .
I therefore agree with the Commission 's vision of upholding and improving the quality of data and of establishing a framework for data transmission , which will provide economic actors with greater transparency and better access to information .
Particular attention must be paid to persistent social problems , such as high-school drop-out rates , the lack of childcare facilities and illiteracy .
I have therefore voted in favour of it
