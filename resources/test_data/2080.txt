the budget procedure .
We also note that improved competitiveness and increased growth in Europe are among the things that are genuinely high on the Barroso Commission ’s agenda and have been so right from the start .
I therefore think it only natural to ask the Commission whether it will face the implications of its sharp focus on the Lisbon objectives and amend the Prodi Commission ’s proposal .
Are there any changes to the structure of the financial framework ?
Are there things to be dispensed with ?
I appreciate that what exists at present forms the point of departure , but it might however be interesting to hear whether there is anything to which more weight is to be given and whether there are any negative priorities .
When we in Parliament debate the financial estimates , we do not focus upon an expenditure ceiling , as some countries in the Council do .
We do not wish to become tied up in the Council’s blinkered discussions of 1 % or whatever .
I am pleased that , in this House today , you have said that percentages are not being discussed in the Commission either – at any rate , not at the moment .
Parliament must therefore call upon the Commission to preserve a stoical calm and first of all discuss the content of EU policy .
We now have a unique opportunity to consider what we want , as well as what we want the future EU to look like between 2007 and 2013 , and that is an opportunity we must not waste .
We must consider obtaining increased benchmarking of our universities in Europe in terms of a fair comparison of who does what best on a cross-border basis , and we must create healthy competition .
Again , it may be asked : ‘Have we obtained the correct focus in what we now have ? ’ This , clearly , is the debate in which we in Parliament shall engage and on which we shall work .
It is regional policy that is the difficult area .
I shall be interested to hear whether you still hold that view , Mrs Grybauskaite , once you are Commissioner .
In this area too , we shall of course look at how to make most effective use of the money and at how to create quality rather than just look to quantity .
What we are able to come up with on the issue of regional policy is therefore crucial , and we appreciate , of course , that this is quite a difficult subject , including for the Council .
It is quite a package that we have here .     Mr President , I should like to begin by thanking Mr Sturdy .
I should like to thank the other ‘shadow rapporteurs’ , and I should also like to thank the Commission and the Council for the sound guidance and advice we have received .
In actual fact , I see this draft Act or legislation as an example of the EU at its best .
Firstly , cross-border trade is of course ensured .
Other , still more important , things are , however , also ensured , namely consumers ’ health , safety and security in connection with the foods they buy .
I am only pleased , however , if I can be sure that the apple I eat is also healthy , and this is something that this legislation can help ensure .
I shall mention a couple of the areas it has been especially important for us Social Democrats to see successfully dealt with and in which I think we have achieved compromises with which everyone can be satisfied .
Firstly , I want to mention the consideration given to especially vulnerable groups .
That is fine , of course .
That too is something , I am pleased to say , that we have obtained .
That is extremely important .
The fact is , it is not enough only to take account of how poisonous or non-poisonous a pesticide is .
That is something it is incredibly important to take account of .
Otherwise , there may be major consequences in terms of health .
I fear that that is already now the case .
My third point is that it is all well and good to have controls and legislation , but we also need to ensure that there are sanctions .
I think it is sensible of us now to oblige the Member States to publish their control results on the Internet .
The consumer must have peace of mind , and that is something we are in this way guaranteeing .
These were not easy things to negotiate successfully but , especially through sound guidance from the Council and the Commission , we obtained a compromise with which everyone can be pleased and which will help secure our objectives .
Common citizenship and votes according to population figures will destroy the EU and give rise to dominance by the big powers .
I do not understand how the Dutch Presidency can put its name to a communications strategy that will take money from opponents of the Constitution and make it available for propaganda on the part of adherents of the Constitution .
It is scandalous .
The money used for propaganda is there for the purpose of selling an undemocratic Constitution to the electorate .
It would be easier to ensure that the democracy we are losing in the Member States were at least combined in an open and democratic EU that was close to the people .
Any change to one of the numerous policies locked into the Constitution must first be proposed by unelectable Commissioners in Brussels and then be based upon a qualified majority in the Council of Ministers or , if appropriate , a unanimous amendment to the Constitution
