have great potential but we are not succeeding in fulfilling it so , we are losing jobs compared to the USA .
I have voted against the joint resolution because it follows the Italian Government 's approach of taking a favourable view of asylum applications from citizens of Kurdish origin .
The ethnic political criterion , with the individual exception of genuine victims of political persecution , like Leyla Zana or Wei Jing Sheng , must be dropped because it will lead to unforeseeable and uncontrollable developments .
Alpine transit ( continuation ) Mr President , since the failure of Switzerland to join the European Economic Area , negotiations between the European Union and Switzerland have covered various sectors .
So we need to take a position on toll systems which brings them into line with Community arrangements and correlates them with the implicit cost of the infrastructure used and its management and maintenance .
Mr President , this debate is proceeding in our language , as might well have been expected , given that it is an issue that is particularly close to our hearts .
For these reasons , we Greens , while supporting the joint resolution , consider it our duty to refer to the democracy clause provided for in the bilateral agreement with Mexico and suspend signature of the trade agreement .
It smacks of lack of respect for the dignity of the species which governs this planet , even if it does fall into a thousand difficulties and errors .
Also , when we speak of human beings it is clear that we must explicitly define what human beings are and say that cloning must be banned from the start of conception throughout all the embryonic stages .
So it is the duty of the Alleanza Nazionale delegation to give its support and approval to the motion for a resolution .
The European Parliament itself repeatedly expressed its view on this issue right up to the final proposal for a directive on legal protection of bio-technological inventions , but it was already very clear on the subject in 1989 with two resolutions on ethical and legal problems of artificial human procreation and genetic engineering .
I think that is an important political event and I believe that the European Union should also appoint such a figure .
I appreciate the tone of the document which has been prepared and which , for the first time , associates a concrete proposal with denunciation and criticism .
Now , when we deal with the issue of effectiveness and evaluation of cooperation and humanitarian aid , we must take account of certain specific characteristics of Community intervention as compared with that of Member States .
Certainly , the effectiveness of public development aid is a complex issue , as has been rightly mentioned in the motion for a resolution , and it is made up of intertwined internal and international conditions and not just of the impact of individual projects and individual instruments .
The cost of servicing the debt was and still is , for many countries , the principal expense for the public purse , in hard currency , and this has produced a situation which is the cause of a huge "negative net transfer ' of financial resources from the South to the North , that is from the poorer to the richer countries .
With today 's vote , Parliament will be opening the way for the Union to join the international initiative , promoted by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund , directed at supporting the structural adjustment and the policies of amortization of the debt , both because it is a positive initiative as a whole - even if it is certainly insufficient - and because we believe that the Union should play an important political role in it .
The reduction of the debt is therefore imperative , but with certain conditions .
The debate about of the reform of the EU Structural Funds for the period after 1999 is already in full progress .
However , regarding the allocation of resources by the new target definition , it should be observed that the globalization of the agricultural and food markets particularly endangers the small-scale mountain farming businesses , which exercise an absolutely primary ecological function , unless special measures and long-term action programmes for the mountain economy are provided .
In the light of the recent approval by the Commission of the Alpine Convention , together with the important reforms contained in Agenda 2000 , it really is necessary to get some new ideas into gear , and this task falls to the Commission .
Can the Commission therefore tell us what measures it intends to take to put the Alpine Convention into effect , to recognise the specific nature of the mountain regions , and above all , to create a serious network of specific measures which would at least create the correct approach to the problems of mountain areas ?
There are substantially two reasons for such notable interest .
Mr President , I would like Parliament to thank His Holiness the Pope for the visit he made to Cuba , to thank this man whose ideal it has been to unite all the peoples of the world to give them the dignity which is their due .
Are we sure , for example , that it will not have negative repercussions on the fabric of small and medium-sized enterprises which , as everyone knows , form the backbone of the European economy ?
The objective of the revision of the STCW Convention and the associated amendment to Directive 94/58/EEC is to remedy this situation and , if possible , to lessen the impact of the human factor on maritime accidents .
It has also introduced new paragraphs which are more in line with Parliament 's wishes and whose objective is to increase safety .
