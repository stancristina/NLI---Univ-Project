In Finland the Government presented a proposal on the ratification of the Treaty to the Finnish Parliament at the start of June , and Parliament will deliberate on the matter in its autumn session .
I am personally convinced that the enlargement of the Union has been a success story .
Not only is enlargement a crucial tool for strengthening stability and democracy , it is also one of Europe’s strategic responses to the challenges of globalisation .
In June the European Council held an important debate on the Union’s absorption capacity .
The bottom line is that the Union should remain an open Community .
Membership negotiations with Turkey and Croatia will also be taken forward on the basis of the progress they have made and the Commission reports .
The process concerning the status of Kosovo is likely to reach a conclusive phase in the autumn .
The Presidency hopes that the parties will achieve results in the exacting negotiations entered into under Martti Ahtisaari by the end of the year .
These we will make efforts to address over a broad spectrum during our Presidency in the various formations of the Council .
It is the Member States which have the principal responsibility for competitiveness .
Finland will strive to achieve results with regard to the Seventh Framework Programme for research .
In Council legislation work and at the meeting of the Heads of State and Government in Lahti we will focus on initiatives designed to create a favourable environment for generating innovation and adopting it effectively .
We are talking about a demand-driven innovation policy .
If there is to be a wide-ranging innovation policy there will have to be more effective cooperation and decision-making in the Union , for example , in standardisation , in the protection of intellectual property , and in the development of the financial markets .
Europe needs to boost the mobility of its intellectual and material resources .
The internal market is the very foundation of the EU.
The role of the European Parliament has been crucial .
I hope that the directive can be finally adopted immediately at second reading in the European Parliament .
The Russian President , Vladimir Putin , has been invited to the dinner that takes place after the meeting , where he and EU leaders will have an opportunity for some informal discussions .
Energy policy choices are largely national affairs .
Energy consumption and the choice of energy sources are closely related to the most serious threat to the environment of our time , climate change .
A comprehensive approach would not only work to promote a response to the climate challenge which is as effective as possible but would protect EU competitiveness .
Both these issues , energy and climate change , will be high on the agenda at summits with third countries during the Finnish Presidency , including the 10th ASEM Summit between the EU and Asian countries , to take place in Helsinki .
This fear was in evidence in the debate on the Services Directive , for example .
There needs to be a balance between reform , social security and environmental sustainability .
The results are to be achieved through close cooperation with the social partners .
The Union’s external relations are linked to the economy , as its external action is based on its economic strength .
We are an attractive trading partner , and that means that we have influence .
During the Finnish Presidency , the EU’s international role will be consolidated and the coherence in the way it acts and functions will be reinforced .
The voice of the Union will only be heard around the world as one of unity if the Union is united .
Coordination of civil and military crisis management will continue .
EU-Russian relations will not just be limited to the issues of trade and energy : the aim is for a broad-based partnership , in which European values and global interests unite us .
The goal will be Russia’s ever closer involvement in democratic European cooperation in the various sectors of society .
During the Finnish Presidency there will be discussions regarding the new framework for the EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement , which expires at the end of next year .
In addition to all this , we will obviously devote our efforts to the crises in the Middle East and other regions .
Finland is also ready to take its presidential responsibilities seriously should the unexpected occur .
In 1999 the Tampere Summit showed the way for the ambitious and democratic development of justice and home affairs .
Now , in 2006 , the assessment of the Hague Programme will provide an opportunity actively to push ahead with European cooperation in this area .
During the Finnish Presidency the political will of the Member States to commit to more effective decision-making , especially in the area of policing and crime , will be put to the test .
I would like to emphasise that cooperation on policing and crime is not just a way of scoring points .
If judgments and decisions by the legal authorities in another Member State are implemented as they stand , this can be a very real way of boosting the efficiency of large-scale , cross-border criminal investigations and speeding up legal proceedings .
We need to take a thorough look at the range of options that the Union has , including agreement on common policies on legal immigration .
More effective border control is just one part of the solution , albeit an important one .
We need to ensure that the Union’s common asylum system is in place by 2010 .
As I said at the beginning , cooperation between the institutions at both European and national level must be developed further .
The debate on Europe’s development is an important one , regardless of the political differences .
It is also a natural
