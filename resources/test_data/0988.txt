Similarly in many countries , including Finland , legislation is currently being drafted on this subject .
It has helped many childless families to overcome their problem .
Biotechnology , when used in accordance with legal and ethical standards , is a great boon to humanity , and benefits mankind in many ways .
We know that , in accordance with the Hippocratic oath , doctors on the whole have high moral and ethical standards and accept their duty to protect human life and promote health by all possible means .
But there are those working in biotechnology who are not bound by that oath .
The Council of Europe 's convention and the opinion being drafted by Parliament are founded on an ethically and morally sustainable basis in contemporary form .
In my opinion , this reflects the opinion of the EPP and public opinion in Finland .
I should like to thank the rapporteur for his successful work in this problematic and important area and I hope that his amendments will be adopted .
It must be possible to prevent the possibility of abuses by law .
Technology and research in this area must be in the service of life , and medical progress in this area arising on this basis should not be hindered .
However , in the light of current knowledge , we should refrain from the manipulation of gametes because the long-term effects of this cannot be assessed .
The trade in human embryos and living organisms should therefore not be permitted .
Research and science have advanced so far that mankind now has in its grasp such powerful tools that it is quite crucial to determine the value basis on which decisions are made .
Mr President , it will be really very difficult for us to carry out our work as Members of Parliament if we do not exercise transparency regarding our economic interests .
The worst problem about Mr Nordmann 's new report is that it merely increases the range of possible interpretations of the proposals .
This is an artificial distinction and makes monitoring more difficult .
At the same time it is appropriate that any economic connections MEPs may have should be listed .
It is equally natural that we should start from the assumption that Members should not receive gifts or services for performing their duties .
If either report were rejected this would be a regrettable commentary on our inability to draw up common rules .
Questions relating to the rules and openness of politics are important for the functioning of democracy .
The world has changed , and the fact that a person belongs to a particular political party does not , for example , tell us everything about his political philosophy .
I would wish to include in this discussion the media who are now closely following the discussion of the Ford and Nordmann reports .
I wish Ireland success .
This increases the expectations placed in Ireland 's presidency .
Youth unemployment and long-term unemployment are indeed high on the list for the Union 's attention .
In my opinion , as far as citizens are concerned , it is the decisive issue , for the whole credibility of the European Union .
Hitherto programmes and reports have been drawn up , but decisions to create jobs in practice have been lacking .
Our citizens expect action , not programmes or reports .
I may remind you of the conclusions of Cannes , Essen and Madrid .
I would give the same answer .
This is referred to in the OECD 's most recent report which regards the alternatives as being continuing high employment or freer labour markets which would leave a section of the population in permanent poverty .
In preparing for enlargement , we did not desire this development .
At the same time , however , we come up against the differences arising from different countries ' different historical experiences .
Neither must our non aligned status hinder our active involvement in designing and bringing about a common foreign and security policy .
We must beware of solutions which may lead to an increase in tension and a new military division .
Getting stuck in a traditional military political viewpoint does not benefit us .
I am glad that my own Social Democratic Group uses a wide interpretation of 'security ' and understands different approaches .
Mr President , in my opinion Mr Fern√°ndez-Albor 's opinion expresses an outdated , cold war thinking .
One positive feature of these structures is the neutrality of four EU Member States .
However , we have before us the question of the enlargement of NATO .
We must of course respect the right of every European State to apply for membership of NATO and NATO 's right to accept new members .
Would joining NATO really strengthen a State 's security ?
In my opinion , Europe 's security can best be promoted by preserving the current basic military security structures and by developing pan-European and transatlantic security cooperation on that basis within the framework of the OSCE , the NACC and the Partnership for Peace .
The EU 's common foreign and security policy must be developed but it must be based on unanimity among the Member States , and it must respect the differing security policy choices of the Member States .
But is not the real problem area the fact that the economy has moved rather in the direction of deflation ?
You clearly wish to rush the economy along at such a speed that over-rapid and violent convergence will only increase unemployment and social exclusion .
In my opinion this does not seem even advisable .
Does Ireland intend to do anything about this serious problem ?
Do you intend to take any new initiatives towards coordinating monetary policy at international level ?
Mr President , the resolution before us relates to the technical realization of the customs union which has
