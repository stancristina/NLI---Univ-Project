in our endeavours to help Turkey integrate into the European Union , we must be strict when it comes to compliance with the political requirements we have laid down .
There is a huge difference in meaning , because to say I am not a Turk , but I call myself a Turk leads some to reason that all nationalities should be ground together into one pulp from which a new human race can evolve .
As you know , historically , such a thing is just not possible .
This , however , does not mean that we should overlook the safety issues surrounding these innovative applications , such as public health safety and environmental protection .
For example , we can build up public confidence by banning the creation or use of GMOs containing antibiotic-resistant genes and by providing agencies and the general public with detailed and objective information .
We are awaiting a more general proposal from the Commission on product liability and safety .
But aside from this serious issue , it has left us with an institutional crisis , a market crisis , a drop in sales of beef products , a drop in prices and , most importantly , a consumer confidence crisis .
In short , we all know what we are talking about .
We wanted the provisions of the regulation to be kept as simple as possible so that they could be applied , and applied as quickly as possible .
Above all , it must not contain exceptions or what we call loopholes , i .e . ways in which the regulation can be contravened either through complex wording or because of local or special exceptions or applications .
First , your rapporteur is calling , with the greatest respect , for a report , a Commission proposal , within the year , on the application of this system to meat products .
The interested party submits an application and , after a period of time , the system which he wishes to apply is applied .
If not , then I am afraid that the system will become too lax and may even become corrupt , and , as a result , we will not achieve our main goal of winning consumer confidence in the system .
The Intergovernmental Conference attempts to answer just that question .
We repeat and insist that the European Union is both a union of states and a union of peoples .
It is precisely our acceptance of that principle which has guided the European Union towards the many successes we can mention , and which , of course , we all like to refer to from time to time .
The third basic principle safeguarded in the report is the proposal for a general - and I stress the word general - review of all the institutional bodies that make up the European Union .
The fourth point concerns a number of new proposals , despite the fact that the issues to which they relate had always been debated .
Secondly , it must contain a very highly developed element of democratic awareness , which means that if any country or countries for some reason do not wish to participate , at least during a first phase , this should not be regarded as an exclusion or as a factor that restricts the presence of those countries in the European Union .
To put it clearly , closer cooperation is a Community process and both foreign policy and common defence policy issues should be dealt with as a Community process , because it provides control mechanisms .
Madam President , the proposals by the Committee on Women' s Rights for the Intergovernmental Conference aim to enhance democracy and effectiveness .
We also stress the need for a close link between the Intergovernmental Conference and the procedure for drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights , so that within the scope of the constitutionalisation of the Union , the fundamental right of equality between women and men will be enshrined in Community law .
This is a truly historic moment , as has been stressed .
According to the draft , the European Union is , first and foremost , a Union of peoples and a Union of states .
Thirdly , the way the Union functions must be made more effective , so that it can cope with the major enlargement .
In this process Parliament ' s responsibility is very great indeed .
But is it enough for procedures to be simplified and speeded up for them to be described as effective ?
The dual legitimacy of the European Union by its European but also its national citizens , by its peoples but also its states , makes the European Union institutionally complex by its very nature .
- ( EL ) The Lisbon Summit , which can only euphemistically be termed " an Employment Summit " despite the clamorous declarations that went with it , achieved no more than to take another step towards changing employment into employability , redefining the concept 'working person ' and destabilising labour relations and rights , to serve the celebrated ' New Economy ' in the best possible way for big business , this being the new name for the old , familiar but still more unrestrained and harsh economic and social liberalism .
Masquerading with the greatest cynicism under the grandiose title of 'modernising the European social model by investing in people ' , are the demands of big business for greater profitability as a means of 'supporting employment ' .
That is the estrangement of people to the benefit of the market , the subjugation of working people to the demands and criteria of monetary credit , and the subjugation of the social state to the indexes and criteria of nominal convergence and EMU.
