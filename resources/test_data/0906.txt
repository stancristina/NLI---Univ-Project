the Spanish coast .
What we are doing is treating the symptoms .
The disease is , of course , the fact that there are 20 million refugees in the world .
It is said that trafficking in human beings is a lucrative business , but I maintain that , with projects like this , it will become still more lucrative .
That means more money from desperate people in the pockets of the mafia .
That means higher prices .
It will mean more unscrupulous players and , therefore , more Dover-style accidents .
He has really made an effort , but it is nonetheless still a matter of treating the symptoms .
We are not treating the disease .
Our group will , of course , support the amendments tabled by the rapporteur and the Liberal Group .
We have voted against paragraph 1 of the motion for resolution which states that Article 42 of the Treaty of Amsterdam is to be the legal basis for securing social security rights for third-country citizens .
The Council must find another legal basis , for example Article 63 of the Treaty of Amsterdam , so that the objective may be achieved .
The Danish Social Democrats have today abstained from voting in the final vote on this motion for resolution , tabled against the background of an oral question concerning the free movement of persons in connection with Regulation 1408 .
We cannot support the attempt to bend the Treaty in this way when there is an adequate legal basis elsewhere in the Treaty , just because a few other procedural regulations concerning the involvement of the European Parliament are at issue .
We should like to emphasise that we support a general reform of Regulation 1408 .
However , we believe that a reform of this kind would be made more difficult if its scope were to be extended to include more people .
We would also emphasise our concern that those from third countries who are seeking work and who are legally resident in the EU must have the opportunity to obtain employment in the EU.
Mr President , we intervened in Kosovo in order to protect the Albanians , who were a minority in Serbia .
Moreover , we must say to the extremist Albanian insurgents that we are not , therefore , there to support the ideas of Albanian extremism .
I should like to assure Mr Dupuis that there were six of us from Parliament who spent the weekend visiting the new leaders in Belgrade .
What we can do here in Parliament is to hold the new leaders to these promises and , if they do not live up to them , then there are things we can do , for we are , of course , the great aid provider , granting large amounts of money , now and in the years to come , to the new Serbia .
The purpose of these urgent topics we are now debating is , of course , to draw the public ' s attention to serious problems in world politics and to serious violations of human rights and democracy .
There is no-one from the press .
It is , in fact , almost like performing a striptease in the dark , if you will pardon the expression .
I also think it is a paradox that we are insisting on the Commission ' s being present - and the Council too ought , of course , to be here - but we have written our motions for resolution before we have heard what they have to say .
I would therefore conclude my speech with the request that urgent topics of this kind be put on the agenda on Wednesdays when the Council and the Commission are here and that we only vote on the motions for resolution once we have heard the remarks on our proposals .
Mr President , we in the ELDR Group are in despair and filled with impotent rage concerning what is happening in Chechnya .
What the Russians are doing infringes a long list of international obligations to which they themselves have signed up .
It may well be that it is no use threatening Russia with sanctions and isolation , but here in Parliament , in the stronghold of freedom of expression , it must be said loudly and clearly that we condemn the abuses , the executions , the disappearances , the concentration camps and the systematic oppression of a whole people .
We urge that the way should now be opened for missions from the UN High Commission , the OSCE and the Red Cross to be permitted to evaluate the atrocities and come to the rescue of the population .
Mr President , during the Strasbourg part-session , I put a question to Mrs Fontaine concerning prisoners in Turkish jails , and I received a very sympathetic answer .
Unfortunately , it was in French , but I have had it translated , so now I understand it too .
That letter describes the process , now under way , of negotiating with the Turkish Government concerning democratisation as a run-up to the whole application and enlargement process .
Hence , this request - it is not Mrs Fontaine who is in the chair , but it is , of course , you who represent the Presidency - to the effect that this matter should once again be addressed and the Turkish authorities once again urged to set the democratic process in motion and move it forward instead of bringing it to a standstill , for what we are witnessing now is a retrograde step .
Mr President , I should first of all like to congratulate Mr Gemelli on this report which is absolutely the most important report we shall be working on in this parliamentary term .
