wrong that we should only meet in Brussels or here in Strasbourg .
I wish you all the very best .     .
We shall not accept that either .
Our prosperity will ultimately count for nothing , however , if it is not rooted in democracy .
With measures like these , we are sure to win the backing of our citizens for the European project .
If no more resources can be mobilised , we have to accept that .
They cannot both be research priorities .
Are you for it or against it ?
Like many other people , I am convinced that Europe would be better off if you were seated on the other side this morning , if you were President of the Commission rather than just the temporary President of the Council .
What about Danone and France ?
Thank you for urging the institutions to enter into a new spirit of cooperation in place of instinctive confrontation and dis-coordination and day-to-day political posturing .
As for south-east Europe , I regard that region as a very high priority .
Mr President-in-Office , we Social Democrats shall judge your presidency objectively .
It has many facets .
How is Europe actually visible in my everyday life ?
If Austria does not settle this matter , which has long been a concern of the Alpine countries , who will ?
You referred yourself to the European way of life .
We adopted the budget for 2006 only a few weeks ago .
We shall negotiate responsibly with you , in a spirit of mutual trust , to determine what is possible .
Let us eliminate , at last , the obstacles that hinder the already difficult utilisation of funds , whether by delays in time or the excessive restrictions imposed .
That is an important and basic premise .
That is something that everyone must be aware of .
At European level , though , we can address the issue of renewable energy , about which Mr Barroso has come up with some truly first-class ideas , and biofuels , in which , might I add , the Americans are investing five times as much as Europe and its Member States combined .
I have no doubt that your House and our Council will take the same approach to this and go forward together .
All I want to do where the European Court of Justice is concerned is to start off a debate in this House , without going into details .
If we look at these things in a realistic and practical light , then I believe that we will certainly , by way of dialogue founded upon trust , be able to sort something out .
It follows that we can no longer rely solely on the provisions of the law , on prohibitions and investments , but must instead try to demand of the public that they cooperate actively and be aware of environmental issues .     .
We will , though , have to redouble our efforts .
To them , by this report , and with virtual unanimity , the Committee on Constitutional Affairs delivers a resounding ‘no’ .
I also agree with Mr Duff that this crisis of confidence and these misgivings about the European project present all of us with an opportunity , of which all of us together – the Commission , Parliament and the Council – must make use .
I hope that one consequence of our joint effort over the coming months will be an increase in positive thinking in Europe , and I agree with Mr Voggenhuber that we must discuss Europe as a , as something that really is to the benefit of all its citizens .     .
I gave a number of examples in the opinion I drafted on behalf of the Committee on Industry , Research and Energy , and perhaps I can adduce one that did not yet count for much at the time I was writing , but has acquired significance over the past few days in this House .
This draft constitution is not equal to the task of creating a CAP that is acceptable to society at large , and so one priority for any future treaty must be to extend codecision to the common agricultural policy , and , in particular , to close the loopholes that remain in Articles III-230 ( 2 ) and III-231 ( 2 ) of the text as it stands at present .
Are we then to say , in all seriousness , that Nice must be cast in concrete ?
There are various options available to us ; my country ’s Chancellor has asked why we do not extend the constitution by adding on to it a protocol on the social Europe , and that is a way forward that we should discuss .
Some , however , attach greater weight to percentages in surveys than to the procedures required by constitutional law .
Together with the other Member States and in consultation with the other institutions , we will work on the road map to which reference was made earlier .
The EU makes a particular point of using these consultations to express its concerns regarding the disappearance of people and the general failure to punish violations of human rights .
The EU has announced that it will closely monitor Russia 's actions during the G8 Presidency .
We also share , of course , the concerns raised here regarding the law on non-governmental organisations .
Under the Montreal Action Plan , future climate change discussions should now follow two parallel paths .
This review will enable us to examine all the possible improvements and to implement them for the period post-2012 .     Madam President , Mr Winkler , I would like to thank you for your very detailed comments on this subject .
