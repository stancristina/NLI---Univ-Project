that the European Court of Justice has put in our hands .
Such cooperation cannot be put in place unless the relevant information is exchanged and made available , but the whole scheme of things needs to be subject to appropriate control , and this is where the rapporteur deserves congratulation on having succeeded in striking the necessary balance between , on the one hand , the protection of personal data and hence of private life , and , on the other , the improved cooperation between police forces and justice authorities in the interests of public security , which is absolutely vital .
In recent weeks and months , the Austrian Council Presidency has started work on a dual approach to bringing Europe forward – and this also applies to the forthcoming European Council .
Europe should also bring greater security through its efforts to improve its emergency and crisis response capacities .
As regards the discussion within the Council , the main emphasis has been on the requisite internal measures , such as improving energy efficiency and moving over to renewable sources of energy .
I should like to make it absolutely clear – because I know that here in Parliament , in particular , scepticism is expressed time and again – that we are not talking here about a desire for re-nationalisation .
Moving on to the subject of the Constitutional Treaty , we have succeeded in breaking the silence that reigned at first .
The conclusions of the European Council will mention the situation regarding the Western Balkans .
I hope that the Summit can send out this message .
My next point is that the period of reflection is being extended , and indeed all parties should be committed to participating in this reflection .
When we celebrate the anniversary of 25 March 1957 next year – on 25 March 2007 – our group will insist that this event not be a celebration of those Heads of State or Government who engage in mutual appreciation under or in front of pretty flags , but rather that it express Europe’s democracy , and that there be European Parliament involvement in the declaration and the establishment of our objectives for the 21st century .
The work that the Council of Europe does today , which has proved its worth , should not simply be transferred to the institutions of the EU ; instead , we should concentrate on ways of complementing each other , since the Council of Europe is also a European community of states , with 46 members .
Bravo , you have done well , Mr President of the Commission .
We welcome the draft conclusions on Romania and Bulgaria .
The President of the Commission is right in saying that Nice is insufficient .
In this context , I was very pleased to read an interview with the boss of the President-in-Office , Wolfgang Schüssel , in the German newspaper – for two reasons .
The failed referendums are the result rather than the cause of Europessimism .
Once this has been done , it is perfectly legitimate to consider holding a referendum .
As regards the partnership with the USA , the Summit with this country follows the European Council , and preparations will also have to be made for this .
At the present time , Europe is completely incapable of meeting the expectations of the public – the Council gives it far too little scope to do so , and the Commission keeps it occupied with tasks that increasingly alienate it from the European public .
I wonder whether we are perhaps once again sending out the wrong signals by setting in motion a train that , 10 , 12 or however many years down the track , we will still not be able to stop .
Mr Poettering and others have mentioned the Fundamental Rights Agency .
That is very important : we have tried very hard to do that , and I am sure that future Presidencies will do the same .
However , I do not understand what consequences the Commission is proposing .
The document that the European Council will adopt in the next few days has no annexes , and is clearly structured , comprehensible and consistent .
Both strategies aim to support the necessary structural changes that will allow the economies of the Member States to face up to the challenges of globalisation , which affect all of us in Europe .
We hope that this will be adopted in the next few days and that it will genuinely be implemented in terms of concrete political action .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the website on sustainable development that was started by the Commission on the 30 May is well-meant and very interesting - the same goes for the two other websites on climate change and climate control - but that does not lessen my criticism of this Commission communication .
We have been keeping all the Council configurations busy , and in recent months we have tried very hard to work through the essential points with the European Parliament and now to present them as a strategy .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , when I was elected into the European Parliament 12 years ago , I would not have thought it possible that we would have to have such a debate yet again .
They have no place anywhere , not in any society , and , I hope , not in this House either !     .
To Mr Agnoletto , who unfortunately is no longer here , I would like to say that I very emphatically reject - and I do this with some personal emotion , too - the accusation that the Austrian Presidency of the Council is guilty - precisely on this question - of inactivity .
Of course , because of the fact of scheduling accession negotiations with several candidate countries , certain parallels may arise
