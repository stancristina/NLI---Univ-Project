Mr Kyprianou , common sense should make you ask yourself what reason there could be for these Romanian women to supply egg cells to British clinics , of all places , free of charge : something that after all entails a serious health risk to themselves .
This GBP 1 000 appears in a document of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority in the UK without further comment , and against this we must be on our guard .
I want to explicitly stress that the growth and employment initiative , the new Lisbon agenda , is a project that can work only if it is understood as being founded on partnership .
It needs a clear political direction .
The Americans , among others , are much better at it .
Let us just look at a few figures and compare ourselves with our main competitors , our partners and friends in the United States .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I agree with Commissioner Verheugen that the realisation of the Lisbon strategy will , over the coming five years , be the most important of the Commission ’s projects .
Those who want this project to succeed while leaving the resources unchanged must not be left without an answer when they want to reallocate them for the benefit of the Lisbon goals .
As the short time available to me prevents me from discussing all three of these points , there is one aspect to which I would like to give particular attention , and I regard it as being of fundamental importance .
We have had five wasted years in which we wanted everything and achieved nothing , and now Europe must come to a decision .
He will recall that we , as part of our coordination on Lisbon , introduced many amendments into the debate , but , on the points where we thought it necessary to make the text more concrete , we did not hesitate to list what we saw as its potential breaking points .
That also means that the lower income groups – who , contrary to what is often asserted , are not saving more than they used to – must either have their wages increased or their taxes cut , all the more so as there is sufficient political room for manoeuvre , productivity having risen much faster than pay over recent years .
We therefore need a European action plan , a European timetable , a European catalogue of measures ; the Commission needs to engage in dialogue with the Member States when drawing up national action plans and it is the Commission that must monitor them .
The President of the Commission and Commissioner Verheugen have presented us with very bold visions .
When handling the Lisbon strategy in future , we will have to take care that the economy , ecology and social objectives do not act against each other , but are instead all subordinated to the goals of the Lisbon strategy .
That is why we cannot have the situation in which categories of expenditure that some Member States regard as special burdens are excluded when assessing to what degree the stability criteria have been adhered to .
Some account should also be taken of the fact that Germany is still the European Union’s main paymaster .
Altering the Pact is certainly worth thinking about ; here in this House , we have heard important arguments as to why it can be applied in different ways at certain stages .
I am not asking you about documents , but I am specifically asking what penalties Council members face if they disclose details of what has been said at Council meetings .
I should like to make one more point , one that I have raised in this House on a number of occasions , and to which you too have referred .
I should like to focus on just one of these priorities , which in all probability will be absent from tomorrow’s report , namely defence research .
There is a great deal for Europe to do ; having studied medicine myself , I know that in this field alone European cooperation is needed , in particular in the fight against rare diseases and children’s diseases , and indeed to achieve any kind of success .
However , we also have doubts on the necessity and proportionality of European data retention provisions .
Finally , why has Parliament never been informed about the negotiations on PNR at an ICAO level ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am grateful to Commissioner  Frattini for having already announced that the Commission will propose its own initiative .
I can tell you that the European public is far from happy with this regulation , and that there are a great many people who say that they no longer wish to fly to the United States because they do not enjoy being treated like criminals .
Commissioner , as a result of the decisions taken at Brussels , which included a cap on the agriculture budget until 2013 , and following CAP reform , which moved funding for modulation from the first to the second pillar – or in other words to cofinancing for rural development – the priority must be to ensure that landowners and farmers in particular get compensation for their efforts .
We therefore call for imported sugar to be produced subject to the same social and environmental standards as sugar produced in the EU.
That does not happen with C sugar , and that is why C sugar must no longer be allowed on the global market .
It is rather unfortunate that this resolution takes no account of the points of view of the trade or development committees , and I hope we will be able to do that when the House comes to debate and consider the Regulation
