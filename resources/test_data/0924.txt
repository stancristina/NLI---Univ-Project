, Mr Verheugen and I are not , presumably , in much agreement , politically , about a lot of things , but I have to say that I have seldom heard so good and precise a description of the problems we are now to face .
I believe that the lack of popular involvement and the lack of commitment on the part of the political elite is one of the reasons why we now see more and more Member States choosing to introduce restrictions in relation to workers from the new Member States .
I think it is the wrong signal to send to our new friends and colleagues from Eastern and Central Europe .
I am also pleased that , in the course of enlargement , many forces have been deployed in monitoring the human rights situations in the candidate countries , and I think that this is one of those areas in which we cannot allow ourselves to relax , either now or after 1 May .
We know that there are problems for the Russian minority in Latvia .
We know that the Roma have problems in many of the candidate countries , and we also know that they have problems too in the present Member States .
My recommendation is that we do what we once did in the Council of Europe when that institution admitted quite a lot of new Member States , namely introduce permanent monitoring of democracy , human rights and minority rights , and not only in the new countries but in all the EU Member States .
It will be an important task to persist in monitoring these areas .     Mr President , I should like to propose that we replace the words , ‘USA’s invasion of Afghanistan’ by the words , ‘the conflict in Afghanistan’ .     Mr President , progress in Europe over a generation shapes the response to the political challenge since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 .
The objective is both a political and a formal unification , as well as a real levelling out of the major economic and political differences that have divided Europe .
We must also remember , however , to tell the people of Europe about our common European success .
Once more , therefore : in our political work , higher priority must continue to be given to informing and communicating with the people .
It cannot , therefore , be repeated often enough : a successful EU of 25 Member States requires the politicians and the institutions to be in dialogue with the people .     Madam President , regarding the matter raised by Mr  Heaton-Harris , six Belgian police officers assembled at 7.10 a.m. last Friday at a journalist’s private residence and removed lists of addresses and telephone numbers , business cards and four telephones and subsequently emptied his office at an international press centre of , among other things , 17 boxes of documents .
The policemen also removed copies of private accounts .
We are now in a situation in which OLAF is interested in seeing accounts belonging to journalists who write about fraud , but has still not requisitioned bank statements from those who have been perpetrating fraud .
I should like to ask the President to see to it that we obtain a full explanation of , and report on , OLAF’s role in this matter , including too the Commission ’s role in the decision to go to the Belgian police .
It is necessary in this connection to get the government in Belgium , where there is no law concerning the protection of sources , to guarantee that they will not intervene in the institutions when journalists write about scandals .     Mr President , I should like to begin by congratulating both the rapporteur from the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities and the rapporteur from the Committee on Development and Cooperation for the work they have done in connection with this report .
They have been an inspiration to each other .
I naturally find it annoying that we have not been able to increase the budget from EUR 9 million to EUR 11 million but , in line with other rapporteurs , I accepted that , if we wanted to conclude matters now , we should have to conclude with a figure of EUR 9 million for the appropriation for the next three years .
In common with others , I attached greater importance to this than to having the budget increased , partly because the previous funds have not been used .
We often talk about the EU being an economic superpower in the world , which is what it in fact is , but it can safely be said that we are positively prehistoric in the area of development .
Gender equality is one of the areas concerned , and a very important area too .
It is a that if we too do not combat female poverty , we shall simply not succeed in getting development under way .
There is reason for hoping that what we have before us may be a stimulus to such development .
It is of course a great pleasure after so many years to be able to put the finishing touches to this directive .
The directive has been in preparation for an incredibly long time , and I am also delighted to commend it to the House tomorrow .
This is something I think we can learn from when preparing the future directives in this area .
I am aware that there are problems in showing the connection between exposure and the development of cancer .
I find it disappointing that this is not mentioned at all in the directive .
If we begin to see a pattern in those cases whereby , after 20 or 30 years , people develop cancer , we should do something about the fact
