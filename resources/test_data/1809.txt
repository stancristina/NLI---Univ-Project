It is incredibly important that we talk about safety , on which we can arrive at a common view .
We are going to be presented with new scientific proposals which point in one direction or another and which , rightly or wrongly , will frighten people .
Finally , I want to say that this is all well and good , but that I wonder how things will work out in terms of compliance and control .
What is there in terms of a possible system of penalties to be imposed upon those Member States and companies which do not comply with the safety standards ?
Let us never forget , however , that it must be implemented .
We also think that it is right to table a number of those amendments again that have not been incorporated into this common position .
It is important to focus specifically upon the safety issues .
In that case , we think it is incredibly important to assert the right to tougher rules for health and environmental reasons .
That is why Amendment No 22 is important to us .
We also approve of the proposal that members should be drawn from a broad geographical area .
If the EU is really to be able to attend to the causes of the problems in this area , reform of the common agricultural policy is needed , above all , so that sustainability and the protection of animals and the environment are put first .
That is a good reason why we should try to achieve something in this area , in contrast to what has sometimes happened with regard to other decisions about liberalisation .
I also want to emphasise what Mr Harbour said about the 'must carry ' principle .
In that context , I also hope that the Commission will apply a fairer competition policy between large and small countries than that we have seen , so that small and different markets too can continue to exist .
In this area , there is no market , as on many other issues .
The market cannot therefore be researched .
That is important for this sector ' s competitiveness in relation to other sectors within the telecommunications sector .
Now let us talk about the future , however .
As the co-decision procedure has developed , Parliament and the Council , too , must also play a larger role in devising the annual programme .
There is an introductory presentation of the general priorities , followed by thorough discussions between the Commission and the committees concerned with a view to establishing the details .
On the contrary , our common framework agreement states that what we are concerned with here is the annual legislative programme .
It should be possible to set up a joint database to monitor the decision-making process for each topic .
Mr President , my speaking time is limited , but I nonetheless want to address a couple of important issues .
Parliament ' s scrutiny and control of aid money will substantially increase .
I also wish , of course , to thank Mr Costa Neves for the way in which he has taken care of the work .
They have not only sought broad solutions within Parliament but have also persistently maintained our positions in relation to the Council , something which has been especially important .
It is , of course , incredibly important that we have been able to produce substantial additional aid for Afghanistan , given the enormous needs that exist .
Personally , I am delighted that we have been able to direct a portion of this aid to women ' s involvement in constructing the future Afghanistan .
One of the biggest problems is that the EU budget is not flexible enough .
Now , moreover , we are seeing its shortcomings for , this year , we had to use the flexibility mechanism for other , heading-2 , aid .
The problem , then , is that all that Parliament can do is account for every single krona in the budget , right up to the ceiling , and not allow for any margins for unforeseen events , or else cut back on other of its high priorities and thus let recipients of aid in other parts of the world in practice pay for our new needs in the Balkans or Afghanistan .
Another fundamental error is , of course , the poor implementation of the EU' s budget .
We have conducted extensive discussions as to which services are required if we are to be able to implement initiatives in different policy areas .
Enlargement is drawing ever nearer .
We must have effective administration and make sure that people regain their confidence in the European Union .
I have two follow-up questions .
Secondly , I wonder if TABD representatives participated when political summits were held between the EU and the United States , that is to say , meetings at the highest political level .
We have already seen how animal nutrition has significance for people ' s health , but the ways in which we treat animals and the methods and systems we use to feed and transport them in fact affect public health as directly as does poor animal feed .
Madam President , in a report to the 133 Committee on the WTO meeting in Qatar , the Commission asserts that 'active participation by European civil society strengthened the hand of the EU negotiator ' .
The truth is that the environmental and solidarity organisations are criticising the EU' s action in Doha and characterising the final agreement as a defeat for the poor peoples of the world .
It is bad enough that the Commission should represent a Eurocentric , self-regarding and neo-liberal trade policy , but is it not rather crude
