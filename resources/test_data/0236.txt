It is because this does not make sense that we will continue to urge you to move further towards the reform that you have set in motion .
The German Football Association wanted to keep this issue in the taboo zone , and our breaking through its defensive wall amounts to a massive success .
I assume – and hope – that you want to tighten up controls on the grant of visas rather than to bring in a temporary visa , for then the question would arise of when one should begin and when it should expire .
