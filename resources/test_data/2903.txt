voluntary institutions acquire information on issues the press are not necessarily reporting , and which are not necessarily the main news stories of the day ?
There has been insufficient preparation for and discussion of this issue , yet it is a very serious matter .
Paragraph 35 states that Member States with small and medium-sized populations are over-represented and this system should thus be replaced with a reorganisation of the weighting of votes and a double majority .
However , paragraph 36 says that the current balance must not be overturned .
It is perhaps due to the fact that the rapporteur is actually only referring to the balance that exists among the states with large populations .
Such a model would possibly be a less destabilising solution than the current weighting structure , and would not be too much of an upheaval for the countries with small populations .
Mr President , first I would like to congratulate Mr Gutiérrez Díaz on an excellent report .
Take the guidelines on employment , for example .
There was sufficient political will there , and hopefully this will also be the case with Article 13 .
I also hope that Germany , as the current presidency , and its successor - my own country , Finland - will be active in the Council in exploiting the opportunities presented by Article 13 .
There are excellent grounds for this , as the northern geographical situation , with its long distances and the fact that it is so far away from European centres , puts the Objective 6 regions in a much weaker position than many others .
Will greater importance be attached to the issue of employment in the Objectives 1 and 3 criteria ?
Border area cooperation is often regarded merely as cooperation which is linked to borders .
The licensing process was made much tighter at that time , and the Member States of the European Union went along with demands mainly from the United States to make the prevention of espionage more difficult .
For this reason , as a binding guarantee of people 's entitlement to good quality water , provision must be made for the polluter pays principle , effective monitoring to ensure that water is of good quality with the smallest number of exemptions possible , and the examination of materials that harm water quality , primarily from the health point of view .
Negligence and irresponsible action can have disastrous and irreparable consequences .
It contains a particularly welcome amendment with Article 3( a ) , which provides for the monitoring of the implementation of the River Basin District Management Plan .
To my mind , at least as far as Finland is concerned , this is a matter of local democracy and the right of the local authorities to regulate charges , and this should therefore not be interfered with .
There are plenty of examples of problems being solved , not perhaps returning water to its natural state , but at least making it safe for humans .
Problems have been discovered both in the quality of the water in the rivers and with water being wasted in urban and industrial areas .
Water resources in the different European states do not constitute the common property of Europe , as with any other natural resources which are used for trade .
The idea of a common water policy should be made a reality through measures to protect areas of water that are shared by neighbouring countries and those affecting different states .
The northern dimension will provide staunch support for this , as it does for other projects aimed at protecting the environment .
In Finland yesterday it was revealed that the Bank of Finland , which belongs to the European Central Bank organisation , pays Sirkka Hämäläinen , who is on the board of the European Central Bank , a pension of around EUR 10 000 a month in addition .
I believe there is reason to suspect that other members of the board of the European Central Bank receive such additional payments .
I wish to thank Mr Bardong for what is a well prepared and expertly explained report .
There is a danger that tax havens will start forming within the European Union .
Member States are taking practical steps to improve the situation regarding both the payment of levies and the recovery of claims .
However , the Member States are independent economic units which are primarily concerned with their own affairs in respect of revenues , and the recovery of other revenues takes second place .
The second problem is that the act of recovery itself , the recovery of claims , the seizure of property and other matters connected with the process , fall under the second pillar of the Union .
For that reason , the recovery of claims , and the degree of cooperation which that demands , are politically sensitive questions .
Stocks of salmon are under threat in Finland too as a result of this sort of intensive farming , particularly as the dreaded salmon parasite has spread to the waters of southern and central Norway .
It has spread north up as far as the Skibotn river , and therefore to the top of the arm of Finland , as it appears on the map , and the Tenojoki river is under imminent threat .
The Finnish authorities have been involved in intensive talks with their Norwegian counterparts , but no solution has been found for the protection of natural salmon stocks in the Tenojoki river .
I would hope that the European Commission will embark on vigorous action to save the salmon stock in the European Union 's longest salmon river for future generations and prevent it from being sacrificed on the altar of intensive fish farming .
