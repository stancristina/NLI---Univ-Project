I therefore support the initiative to include research into the health situation of the sexes in the new health and consumer protection programme ( 2007-2013 ) and take it into account when planning the Seventh Framework Research Programme .     .
I feel that we both work on the basis of the same opinion that tourism is an industry with the potential to revitalise societies , and that this should not be neglected .
As a result of the economic development and the improved quality of life in Europe , we have a number of responsibilities towards the rest of the international community .
The first proposal was tabled five years ago ; in 2001 , Parliament tabled over one hundred amendments in the Watson report ; the Council spent two years in negotiations and finally arrived at the general approach in April 2004 .
That being said , we must take on board the fact that the Member States wish to combat the abuse of asylum systems by economic migrants .
This concept was a success when it was implemented in Germany ; there was a reduction in the number of cases of abuse and in the number of people seeking asylum .
I should like to ask the Bureau to ensure that the translation service works in such a way that we can follow every debate in its entirety .     . – Mr President , it is well known that the wine sector is going through a difficult time , not least in Portugal where there are increasing numbers of good wines that are having trouble competing in the marketplace .
With regard to both labelled designations of origin and traditional wine-making practices in Europe , this is what must be done if the quality of wine is to be maintained and consumers are to be protected .
This does not hide the fact that I am well aware of the importance of concluding the agreement with the United States .
I sincerely hope that the disappointing outcome of this first phase of negotiations can be offset by the second round , which we hope to see concluded swiftly .
These aspects , which one might call non-quantitative , must be taken on board in any agreement , including this agreement with the United States , a country that imports 40 % of our wine exports .
For example , from what I have read in the newspapers , we do not know whether or not Madeira wine and Port wine are included among those that the United States accepts as designations of origin .
I voted in favour of the Costa report on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and Bulgaria on certain aspects of air services .
Accordingly , and in light of the fact that the Court of Justice of the European Communities has recognised the Community’s exclusive competence in this area , the Council has authorised the Commission to open negotiations with third countries aimed at replacing certain provisions in existing bilateral agreements with a Community agreement .
Accordingly , the rapporteur’s position is that the level of the fee should be commensurate with the actual workload involved in evaluating the products .
I must also register my dismay at the Commission ’s failure to consult the Portuguese sector in the course of the negotiations relating to the proposal before us .     .
This is due to the low level of utilisation during the previous protocol , which demonstrates that the distant water fleet has become ever smaller , as evidenced by the negligible size of the Portuguese distant-water fleet .
The Commission has also stated its intention to hold talks with the tuna sector in autumn 2005 , to address all of the relevant issues to the sector .
As the rapporteur points out , this is an inappropriate and unnecessary proposal , which breaches the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms .
I am broadly in favour of the thrust of the proposal tabled by the four Member States , and share the concerns expressed therein .
Accordingly , let us now hope that the Commission justifies the trust placed in it and , at the earliest opportunity , presents the proposal required to regulate this important area .     .
Take , for example , the issue of the suspensive effect of appealing against a decision not to grant refugee status .
A series of moderately flexible rules aimed at making the necessary adaptations to the various national legislations in no way undermines the need to ensure decent , humane hosting of refugees .
What is different must be treated differently , and the differences evident in the outermost regions have a very detrimental effect on their economic and social development , resulting in unacceptable competitive disadvantage and an inability to make the most of the benefits triggered by the internal market , the recent enlargement , the Lisbon Strategy and globalisation .
The Commission is also proposing the setting up of innovative instruments , such as the specific programme to compensate for additional costs , along with a wider neighbourhood action plan to aid integration of the outermost regions into the surrounding geographical areas , which will involve both transnational and border cooperation on the one hand and trade and customs measures on the other .
This is particularly true of policies designed to boost human capital , technological research and development , the environment , services of general economic interest and telecommunications .
For any policy to be implemented successfully , it needs a good strategy , as we are all aware .
I also share his concerns as regards the uncertainties concerning the policy instruments required to give the proposed strategy tangible form , such as those instruments designed to solve the current impasse on the financial perspective for the next programming period .
I therefore put
