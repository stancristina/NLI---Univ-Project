, Mr Lamy , untruthfully to try to make Europe ' s popular movements jointly responsible for the shameful abuse of power of which the EU was guilty in Doha ?
The first is what is absolutely the most important objective of a health programme , namely to ensure that diseases do not occur at all .
My second point relates to complementary medicine .
This says that we need to develop strategies for reducing resistance to antibiotics .
All products intended as animal nutrition are now defined by a common term in all animal feed legislation .
That , ladies and gentlemen , is in practice the precautionary principle .
The committee and I believe it is profoundly immoral simply to pass on in that way products which do not fulfil the requirements of the directive .
Subsequently , the Commission and the Council came and offered negotiations under the Belgian Presidency .
This solution is a technical way of plugging a time gap so that , when the general law comes into force , the provisions of this law will apply to re-export in accordance with this directive .
It is not , then , a new proposal but is concerned with bridging a particular period of time .
I realise with deep regret that we have to withdraw our compromise proposal and are thus forced into a conciliation .
Two days ago , a Swede was expelled from Belgium for having put up posters for one of the legal demonstrations to be held in conjunction with the Laeken Summit .
However , it is our view that the amendments proposed by Parliament in its second reading would only lead to the concept of public health being undermined , to a breach of Article 152 of the Treaty and to encroachment upon Member States ' self-determination in the area of health care .
The European Union must concentrate on its main tasks - promoting peace and democracy , human rights , free trade and initiatives for improving the environment .
Here , it is more important than ever for the European Parliament to show the political maturity and discipline required not to demand new policy measures at European level , but instead to rally around the central joint undertakings .
Let taste , culture and lifestyle remain different for Greeks , Spaniards , Swedes , British and Germans .
We Swedish Social Democrats voted in favour of the report on the Directive on the reduction of the level of pollutant emissions from two and three-wheel motor vehicles .
If the limit were to be established now , there would be a risk of emissions from future motorcycles becoming higher than necessary .
Turchi report ( A5-0439/2001 )
It is reminiscent of Orwell ' s Animal Farm , where some are more equal than others .
( The President cut the speaker off )
In this context , I should like to take this opportunity to ask the Commissioner responsible for external relations , Mr Patten , about his view on the methods for strengthening co-operation specifically between the UN and the OSCE.
Is it not the case that conflict prevention and democracy ultimately rely on reconciliation , compromise and the ability of each and every one of us to tolerate a defeat ?
This is no way to maintain the dignity of Parliament .
As Commissioner Patten and Mr Gahler have said , positive moves are being made , but there is also much that is negative .
In contrast , we believe that the Gahler report has its merits , but that it is too weak and must be made bolder on a number of points .
I heard Mr Gahler mention it orally just now , but it is not included in the resolution .
Amendment No. 19 states that Iran is not a safe country for refugees .
However , I stand by my earlier reflection that it is better to act before an accident occurs than to react after it .
This must be seen as clear progress .
The report on port State control also looks significantly better now .
In this case too , Parliament has had almost all its amendments included in the Council ' s common position .
Hopefully , this will ensure that accidents such as those involving the Erika or the Levoli Sun will not occur in the future .
This is a classic example of a discharge from an unknown source , and despite the restructuring of port and pilotage fees which we have adopted at EU level , these small discharges have increased in the Baltic Sea .
However , double hulls are no help now , as the ice has already formed in Primorsk port .
Mr President , I am speaking this evening as much in my capacity as draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Petitions as in my capacity as a Finn with Swedish as my mother tongue and a representative of the Group of the Europe Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party .
According to one set of figures , several thousand of these people are living in the town of Haparanda , on the border with Finland , as they cannot afford to return to Finland .
The different variants of agreements in this area are a problem which I believe should also be covered by the open method of coordination .
He also found that he had learned more during the enquiry than he had in his eight years as a minister .
It is particularly important that we work together to ensure that citizens have good access to information in this area .
My amendment was unfortunately rejected by Parliament .
Mr President , I want to thank Commissioner Kinnock for his extremely detailed report .
Mr Kinnock , I really did try to keep up with what was going on here
