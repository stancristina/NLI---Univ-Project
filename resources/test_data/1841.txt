Although in this case Parliament’s decision might appear to be justified – and we must also consider that the measures to restrict Mr Pannella’s freedom have meanwhile been dropped – we must not in any way interpret this as a precedent , should a similar case arise in the future .     – There is no doubt – and it is an obvious thing to say – that the conflicts in the Middle East are becoming more tragic by the day .
Mr Patten is right : it does not mean that terrorist acts in themselves , irrespective of the policies that are being implemented , should be condemned and suppressed .
Not with arrogance and imperialism , however , please !
Why , though , do we always have to keep repeating and reiterating these things ?
We can see this in speeches with which , in some cases , I could not disagree more , such as Mrs Morgantini’s speech , but not just hers .
I believe that this can be done , and in this case I appeal to Commissioner Patten and the Irish Council Presidency to call for an end to the conflicts .
I believe that this could once again give politics a real voice and not just an issue on which to speculate in this Chamber .
The European Council dedicated five paragraphs to condemning Israel for this , but I do not recall having read anything in the text about employing handicapped children for just a few euros to turn them into human bombs with 10 kg of explosives .
To conclude , I applaud the fact that the major leaders of the European left finally recognise , as we have been saying for 30 years , that the accession of Israel and Palestine to the European Union is another important path towards reaching a lasting solution to the Middle East issue .     Mr President , the most detailed and in-depth analysis of the limits to the development of democracy in the Arab world and of its consequences on development in those societies came from the first report of the United Nations Development Programme that was drawn up in 2002 .
Can Sharon’s Israel still be defined as a country under the rule of law despite the extrajudicial executions , collective punishments , the construction of a wall in Palestinian territory , the settlements and the lack of access to fundamental resources such as water for the Palestinian people ?
In order to ensure a future of peace in this area , however , greater responsibility is needed and all our efforts , our political authority and our financial and human resources must be used to ensure that we get back on the road to negotiations .
The valuable frescoes that have for centuries adorned the Orthodox temples and monasteries in the Balkan region are the heritage of humankind as a whole and must be safeguarded and protected from any risk of destructive folly , as we have stressed in our resolution .
From a legal point of view and given the legal background of the Union and the Member States , the reason for this is not understood .
The European Council which closed in Brussels last Saturday followed the same instinct .
I therefore wholeheartedly welcome the measures to coordinate and unify intelligence , police and security systems that were agreed upon last weekend .
Both options must be pursued multilaterally , since unilateral approaches are no longer enough .
Terrorism also has an ideological component , however aberrant it may be , as well as a political agenda , and so it is necessary to confront the crisis situations that split the world and threaten its stability .
Four years ago , in Lisbon , the Union decided that in order to maintain and develop our way of life we should put in place a thorough reform of our economic systems .
Investment in human resources and knowledge , which we all consider indispensable , does take a very long time to provide a return .
I am sorry to have to make these points , but I believe it is only right and proper to do so .
The stage was set in Brussels for the resumption of negotiations on the constitutional treaty in the near future and for their conclusion before the end of the Irish Presidency , thanks to some extraordinary mediation by the Presidency , to whom I extend my praise and admiration .
The discussion should , instead , centre on the opposite question : what are the best ways and means to make decisions , not to block them ?
Judging from the latest developments , another failure seems to have been averted ; it therefore seems likely that we will soon have our long-awaited and beloved Constitution .
What do we see today instead ?
The only thing we are sure of is that the environment is a non-priority , and for us that is a great setback .
Ask the voters who have just voted in France and Spain ; ask them what they think of the systems and conditions of work and welfare in the United States and in developing countries .
A final word on Iraq .
We must also address the activities that go on in European mosques : in recent days , not just in Rome but throughout Europe , hundreds if not thousands of mosques have been holding prayers for Sheikh Yassin , the theorist and instigator of suicide bombings and terrorist murders .     . – I shall be very brief because I identify completely with the replies given by Mr Ahern and the energetic policies developed on all the subjects covered by the European Council .
When the first change happened , Commissioner Dimas was quickly and efficiently brought in and he has already started his excellent work .
I am sure he will be very pleased .     – Since Parliament is today being visited by a high-level delegation from the Russian Federation Duma , I should
