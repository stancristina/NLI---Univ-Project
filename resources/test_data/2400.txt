I voted in favour because I believe that implementing an effective common policy for air transport needs to be strengthened by current safety standards and the overall efficiency of air traffic in Europe in general .
I therefore believe we would be justified in adopting safeguards that will enable each Member State to implement the necessary measures to protect key interests in the field of security and defence policy .     .
Nevertheless , there are some aspects that we proposed but were not accepted .
This regulation contains a separation of functions between national supervisory authorities and service providers , which will enable the various authorities to opt for the service provider of their choice , under a non-discriminatory system of charging .
It should be recalled that the Commission ’s original proposals completely ignored the unique and vital nature of the services in question and their relationship with the exercise of Member States’ public powers .
The low level of integration of national air traffic management systems and the slow rate of introducing the operational and technological standards necessary to obtain the sought-after additional capacity are the result of the fragmentation of the systems market and of the consequent lack of industrial cooperation .
It also constitutes an important instrument of economic policy with a potential socio-economic impact .
We therefore voted against the common position of Parliament and the Council .     .
I also endorse the proposal to encourage the use of electronic signatures as a way of guaranteeing and reinforcing the confidentiality of proposals .
It is odd , to say the least , that in the report on services of general interest in the last plenary session , Parliament displayed its opposition to opening up the water supply market , while here it tacitly accepts such a move .
While I understand that , in the absence of adequate infrastructure , the targets that have been set are utterly unrealistic , I am bitterly disappointed that as far as my country is concerned , along with Greece and Ireland , the implementation of this new directive has been postponed until the end of 2011 .
As for relations between Eurostat and National Statistics Services , we must not overlook issues of data protection regarding information passed between administrations .
It is , moreover , increasingly seen as an important means of protecting nature and of managing and conserving natural resources .
In light of the first ministerial-level meeting of the Irish Presidency , which centred on what should be done in the near future – and in which , according to the minutes ... , the proposal of the ‘European Constitution ’ as a basis for negotiation drafted by the ‘Convention ’ and the desire to reach agreement before Parliamentary elections in June will have been reaffirmed – Parliament once again welcomes such an approach and urges reaching agreement by 1 May .
This is why we voted against the resolution .     .
I therefore voted against .     .
A thorough evaluation must be carried out into the impact of unbridled liberalisation in the sector , especially now that the Textiles and Clothing Agreement has come to an end and that China has joined the WTO .     .
The EU and its Member States must establish support programmes and incentives for SMEs , so as to stimulate investment in research and development .
According to the story , however , the reports from that country are marked by unprecedented abuse perpetrated against Portuguese workers .
As the rapporteur suggested in his explanatory statement , this is clearly a political decision , and this debate clearly bears out this view .
Consequently , I feel that the rapporteur’s first initiative , which was not accepted in its entirety by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , must be endorsed and supported by plenary .
A further welcome proposal is the provision of protection for freelance workers and others whose safety is endangered by workers exhausted from working such long hours .
Lastly , I deplore the fact that the Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats persists in disparaging the report approved by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , which only serves to show that they are perfectly happy to perpetuate an unacceptable state of affairs that undermines effective health and safety protection of workers .
Use vaccines ?
We have a duty to ensure that our actions contribute to making health policies accountable , as regards this new disease too , in the face of which we feel powerless .
It must present reports , specifically on situations of poverty and social inclusion – deliver opinions , establish contacts and cooperate with the relevant bodies in this field .
One of the proposals that the EP has adopted and which I tabled in the Committee of Employment and Social Affairs seeks to ensure that the joint report on social protection pays ‘particular attention to poverty issues and to progress in social inclusion within the EU Member States and in the accession countries’ .
Nevertheless , we must welcome the fact that this council also has the tasks of monitoring the social situation , of promoting the exchange of good practice and of establishing appropriate contacts with management and labour .
The purpose of this report is therefore essentially procedural : to establish the Council in accordance with the new legal basis .
An effective process of information shall be established to permit the European Parliament to follow matters up on a regular basis , and the candidate countries must be informed and consulted .
There is no problem as regards the initiative’s compatibility with Community legislation , because this is even more stringent than the Protocol , since the Community has stepped up and strengthened
