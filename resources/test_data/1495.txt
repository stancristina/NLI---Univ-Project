of quality and must then actually be used in the negotiating process ; The Austrian Presidency of the Council will be producing what might be termed a handbook for chairmen of Council working groups with the title ‘’ .
I also sometimes suspect that this debate on better lawmaking is intended to distract us from our real functions as legislators and to serve as a pretext for inaction on the part of those who legislate for the Community or for better regulation meaning deregulation .
After a number of years , I believe we are now on the right track towards finding a solution with which both the Council and Parliament can be satisfied .
For this reason , I am convinced that we need external scrutiny of European legislation , and that this cannot just be carried out by the Commission itself .
For that reason , too , it is vital to have an independent element .
I would once more solicit Parliament’s support .
That is exactly the way President Barroso and I see it .
I should like to query whether I have understood correctly , therefore , that the last two of these ten Member States , namely the Czech Republic and Hungary , are due to join in 2010 ?
The EU is alien to the majority of citizens , who do not consider it their homeland .
Therefore , I , too , am in favour of the rapporteur’s motion .     – Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am much obliged to Mr  Takkula for the work he has done , and I am also pleased that it really had the support of the whole committee .
This is another area in which it is possible to achieve more with a little more money than a great deal of other things that could have been devised .
We want to promote the active , civil-society projects in the EU , in which there is so much idealism : they need our attention and support .
This new draft makes the panel more democratic .
The new Financial Perspective is likely to reduce the amount envisaged for the European Capitals of Culture , too , which we greatly regret .
The website is a potential tool for passing on such things , too .
The additional paragraph 3 in Article 9 gives the Member States , and in particular Austria and Denmark , the option of retaining their existing further-reaching bans on the placing on the market of fluorinated gases .
Austria and Denmark – as has frequently been mentioned , including , commendably , by the rapporteur , who has continually defended this position – have laid down general bans on the use of fluorinated greenhouse gases .
It was only because we worked very much across group boundaries and as a close-knit and single-minded negotiating team that we managed to achieve this result at all , and for that I am most warmly appreciative .     . – Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , the road here has been a long and difficult one , and without this Parliament we would not be where we are now .
In 2008-2009 , we will be reviewing all the figures all over again .
In so doing , we must make use of all the institutions .
We have agreed a gender equality pact in the workplace , ‘flexicurity ’ is being discussed in great detail at every level , and the globalisation fund proposed by the Commission provides us with the proper means of giving , through retraining or additional training , a new chance in the labour market to those workers adversely affected by structural change .
It strikes me as particularly significant that the European Council has adopted Mr Barroso’s idea of founding a European institute for technology , although it was at first highly controversial , for the understandable reason that there are those who fear the creation of huge parallel bureaucracies , while others fear that the existing centres of excellence could lose out .
The whole situation positively cries out for a new joint effort on the part of Europe , and the Commission has done a first-class job of preparing the ground with its Green Paper , which the Council has taken on board , also defining as its three objectives security of supply , the competitiveness of our own industry and the improvement of environmental quality .
I guarantee that it will be , and so , of course , does the European Parliament .
This budget is for a period of seven years and is intended to provide not only legal certainty for the programmes but also , and primarily , to enable the new Member States to implement the things for which they hope .
A number of Member States have formed a coalition , the Visegrad states – Poland , Slovakia , the Czech Republic and Hungary – among them , and Austria is also playing its part by offering scholarships to Belarusian students , and this is what prompts me to ask the Commission for support , in order that we might give Belarus real help .
If I may turn to energy policy , we have heard from the Polish Government , which does not demonstrate much commitment to Europe , that it expects European solidarity in matters of energy policy , and I say that they are right to do so , for this European Union is founded upon solidarity .
The crucial issue is about how we apply solidarity to our handling of energy policy .
Half a year ago , the Summit was rejected ; the EU seemed paralysed , with little to show for itself , and a large majority in this House repudiated what emerged from the December summit .
