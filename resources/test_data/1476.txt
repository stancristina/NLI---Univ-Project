The co-existence of three systems , tachograph , tachograph plus and on-board computer , can only make enforcement more difficult .
Mr President , the last time it met , this Parliament spoke out for a tough approach to dealing with danger on the road .
Fifth , I think we have the best chance of finally reaching a decision if we go for 1B , given the views in the Council of Ministers .
But how does that help me solve my everyday problems ?
We have already discussed your 1991 proposal .
Your staff , Commissioner , do an excellent job in listening to questions from those who are affected by this and their organizations .
Mr President , if the responsibility lies elsewhere , we must act together to resolve the matter , but I expect the Commission to indicate clearly , and to this Parliament , why what is being blocked and , together with Parliament , look for possible solutions .
I support Amendment No 3 , Mrs Oomen-Ruijten 's amendment , to give border workers the opportunity to obtain medical care on the territory of the other state concerned as well .
I take the view , therefore , that solutions could be found , for example within existing euro-regions .
Mr President , I can always say to my compatriot that the Commission is aware of the problems we have .
It is actually very simple because there are proceedings before the Court of Justice or the Court has given a judgement .
He was right ; I will discuss swine fever .
My second question is : should the system not be judged on risk ?
I think there was no justification for this , as the problems in 1995 were exactly the same as those in 1996 , and we have had SEM 2000 in the meantime , which means there will be some improvements .
This is good news , but I think it will throw the entire system into confusion , because the Spanish authorities seem to be saying that the manufacturers are selling their cigarettes knowingly and despite warnings to known smugglers .
This kind of unilateral declaration might lead to a significant shift in trade traffic .
I was given a response by the Commissioner , also after the debate last night , which was negative .
Who in this House will therefore dare to vote against my proposals for it to be referred back to committee , on account of the British Presidency on 6 April ?
Maybe that is why more jobs are is created in the United States .
Unless the EIB is constantly involved , marketing it will be difficult .
There have been some examples of cooperation between transnational SMEs in central and eastern Europe and in the Third World .
What is also important is the length of the programme .
What is also remarkable is that it covers both national , regional and local systems .
To conclude , Mr President , I would very much like to thank the Members and the Secretariat of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for their excellent cooperation in this difficult case .
I am still extremely satisfied that we ended up doing this , albeit with a great deal of trouble .
The final assessment should devote considerable attention to the quality of job creation , to social protection and trade union rights for example , as well as to the type of job creation .
Mr Pronk mentioned that we worked together very closely on this point and that we acted unanimously .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would also like to start by thanking Mr Pronk for the work he has done on his report , which could be seen as ground-breaking as far as this Parliament 's work is concerned .
These people are simply not on the market at the moment .
We need further training .
May I point out that the collective nature of this project meant that , in addition to the SMEs we also wanted to incorporate innovative actions in the labour market and in the third system ?
Mrs Schörling , a representative from Sweden , takes a rather anti-European Union view .
I understand that the Socialist group let this pass rather more easily than we do , but we are not able to accept this under any circumstance , Mr President .
It was approved by that committee four months ago , and the Bureau is refusing to put it to the partsession .
Mr President , shipbuilding is a global industry and should be approached as such .
It even flagrantly contravenes the principles of the internal market ; one yard may get 3 to 9 % in aid , whereas another may get 60 to 70 % .
The ultimate goal must still be the abolition of all types of government support , so that every yard gets the price it deserves .
Mr President , out of respect for you I have kept quiet this week about this matter , but now that it is being raised I would like to make some comments , otherwise you might think I agree with you .
Finally , the issue here is communication .
I did take these into account .
But the intention to incorporate gender issues into all policy areas is sadly not being realized .
There is one point I would like to draw your attention to , and this is similar to the one Mr Liese just mentioned .
Together with the new Lomé Convention a clear agreement should be drawn up for the OCAT.
Mr President , in the limited time that I have at my disposal , all I can offer is a few words
