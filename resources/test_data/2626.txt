of the European Union and by all candidates for accession to it .
Thanks to good cooperation with the British presidency of the Council and with our colleagues on the Committee , particularly with our coordinator Mrs Roure , the overwhelming majority of Social Democrats have endorsed this act as an important weapon in the fight against terrorism , while being no less determined in our opposition to torture of any kind .
This reinforces my conviction that our Parliament must , without delay , appoint a committee to investigate all such accusations .
That shows what the other great democracy on the other side of the Atlantic is capable of , and this gives us our starting point : what the democrats and the supporters of the rule of law , both in Europe and America , have in common , is not only the capacity to combat terrorism , but also the capacity to do so under credible conditions and while maintaining the rule of law .     .
Turning to the deadline for the decommissioning of the nuclear power plant at Kozloduj , I would like to ask Commissioner Rehn what the Commission thinks about paragraph 29 , which allows for greater flexibility with regard to the closing down of Blocks 3 and 4 .
I should also like to thank the Commissioner responsible , who is present in the Chamber today , for his willingness to compromise on many points of detail that were of crucial significance for Parliament .
We are of course all aware that sustainable production is crucially important for Europe , with a view to meeting the Lisbon goals , but there can be no question that we were right to avoid making manufacturers responsible across the board , as it were , for the scrapping of machinery , since it is genuinely impossible for them to know all the details of the scrapping process in advance .
The situation in which we find ourselves today could be aptly summed up by the famous proverb , ‘good things come to those who wait’ .
The manufacturers of certain types of machinery which the scope of the Directive has been extended to cover will now also reap the benefits of the internal market .
It was nonetheless necessary for the Social Democrats to incorporate a number of key considerations , and indeed this meant that we had more in common with the Council during most of the rounds of discussion .
If we were always to take this approach as our starting point for debates on the Services Directive , we would doubtless also make progress with that dossier .
It means that we should push forward measures to put in place a uniform regime , especially in the case of the tractor directives .
They have done a splendid job and made our work easier .
When they arrested five senior monastics , 400 monks mounted a peaceful demonstration for their release .
It is often the case in these debates that we take up the cudgels against small-time dictators and neglect to address the human rights situation in major states that are of strategic and economic importance to us .
Mr President , the fact that we , in this House , are already adopting the third resolution on Ethiopia in less than half a year shows how grave and disturbing the situation in that country is .
The fact is , though , that more needs to be done ; transposing the anti-discrimination directives cannot be something that Member States are left to do as and when they feel like it , and – as has already been said – if their authorities interfere with the right to demonstrate by , for example , banning gay pride marches , then they have to be called to account .
Third-country nationals would acquire the rights of EU citizens while retaining their rights in their home countries .
Human beings appear to be less valuable than animals , and every year sees an enormous increase in the number of women and children who are trafficked ; in the absence of solid statistics and figures , estimates range between 800 000 and 3-4 million women and children every year .
For this , the prosecuting authorities will need staff and funding allocated to them , and information offices on the trade in women will need to be set up .
We have to drain this swamp and take action , and , with the action plan and with the help and cooperation of other bodies such as the Council of Europe , the OSCE , and the United Nations , we will be able to do just that .
The trafficking in women and children , along with forced prostitution , must be banned , prosecuted and impeded , both nationally and at the European level .
What I would like to know is whether you are thinking in terms of a new initiative .
In doing that , we will have to be cunning and maintain a united front .     Mr President , Commissioner , both before the WTO conference in Hong Kong and during it , the Commission kept Parliament constantly informed as to the current state of the negotiations .
The points I would like to make today have more to do with the general situation .
Let me remind the House of the fact that all the arguments for or against a directive on sea ports have been the subject of intensive debate for months , and that there are two things that were determined as long ago as the Committee on Transport and Tourism’s hearing last June .
Fifthly , the directive , as amended , is right from the economic and consumer point of view , since it is vital to exports and imports , and of benefit to our consumers , that all ports be regulated even more efficiently and economically
