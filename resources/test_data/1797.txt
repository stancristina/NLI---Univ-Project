I think it important , however , that , in connection with regulating the safety of road transport , we obtain a clear definition of the rules relating to driving time and rest periods , viewed partly in relation to features supplementary to these rules , such as the rules governing drivers ' working time , as well as checks that the rules governing driving time and rest periods are being complied with .
It is therefore important that the concept of driving time be defined as the period during which the vehicle 's wheels are turning and that there be no confusion with the rules governing drivers ' working time .
That is because the quality of a rest is not necessarily directly proportional to its length , and it is also important that drivers themselves be able to organise their rest periods and choose where they are going to rest .
That is something we must do something about .
It is important that they be safer when they take their breaks .
The Council has accepted that countries must make efforts in this area , and I am looking forward to seeing some practical initiatives soon .
- ( DA ) We shall vote in favour of compromise Amendment No 30 and Amendment No 21 if Amendment No 30 is not adopted .
We would point out , however , that the content of the amendments must not be included in a possible future European constitution but be included in a future treaty .
The June Movement does not , in fact , wish to see a European constitution that will take precedence over the national constitutions .
Mr President , kalispera , the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities would also like to welcome the Greek Presidency .
That means you have a special duty to give the EU a democratic overhaul .
Open up all meetings in which you debate laws .
Give the European Parliament and the national parliaments access to all papers from the Council 's working parties .
Introduce public access to documents according to the principle of best practice among the countries .
Give the Ombudsman a new statute , giving him or her access to everything for monitoring purposes .
Give the Court of Auditors the access required for monitoring both the Commission and the organisations that use EU funds .
Retain the rotating Presidency so that each country has six months in which to pull out all the stops .
Also , let Greek hospitality be accompanied by efficient organisation so that we can follow the work on your as yet unfinished web site and are able in six months to say what a jolly good Presidency Greece 's was .
Mr President , I should like to thank Commissioner Patten for a very precise and very satisfactory answer .
In answer to the only supplementary question , I should like to be told whether the military action currently being taken by Israel in the Gaza Strip and on the West Bank affects the EU 's policy of aid to the Palestinian people .
I also think that this is all illustrated very graphically by the fact that it has not even been possible to hold democratic elections in the Palestinian area because of the situation inflicted by Israel upon the Palestinian people .
Mr President , I should like to begin by thanking Mr Mantovani for the work he has done on this report .
I should like to thank the Commission for the survey it has given us of future care for the elderly , for I do believe that the Commission communication is genuinely constructive .
It indicates a number of overriding goals in terms of access , quality and financial sustainability .
It also points out that , even though we know that there will be many more elderly people in the future , it is quite uncertain what that will actually mean in the form of future financial burdens .
That is true in relation to public health policy , on the basis of Article 152 of the Treaty , to economic policy and to the development of the internal market .
My group must therefore also reject Parliament 's present proposal , as put forward in the report , that we should introduce outright open coordination when it comes to health policy and policy in relation to the elderly .
The open coordination method has , of course , become very popular in recent years and is used in a great many areas of economic policy , such as pensions , social exclusion within education and the convergence criteria in employment policy .
I am a great believer in using open coordination because it is a way of achieving common objectives without needing to legislate in a lot of new areas , but I think it important that open coordination be binding .
That applies in the case of economic policy and employment policy .
It might be said that the Member States have every possible freedom to decide to coordinate their efforts and develop good practice .
That is something we have done within the framework of the OSCD for many years , but the difference between OSCD reports and the open coordination we undertake within the framework of the EU is - and , in my view , should be - that open coordination is more binding and that the countries in actual fact undertake to pursue the common objectives .
In addition , the parties concerned are very actively involved .
It is of course a basic principle of EU cooperation that we accept diversity and difference .
We must not sneak harmonisation in through the back door in areas where national competence should clearly apply .
In the health sphere , there are many areas in which cooperation and
