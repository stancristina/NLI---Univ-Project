I am going to highlight three fundamental aspects .
The terrorists take advantage of the eradication of physical borders and the remaining legal and police borders between the Member States , and it is therefore vital to progress in the creation of this space to prevent it from being abused through the courts .
The Convention needs to address this issue and propose the necessary amendments in order to achieve a single structure that covers the area of internal justice .
I would also like to ask you whether you are going to inform Parliament of the progress of these negotiations and their result , and whether you are going to take account of Parliament 's resolution of last December in this regard .
I am briefly going to talk about a few ideas which , at the proposal of my group , have been included in the common resolution upon which we are to vote tomorrow , as they are in keeping with the role of driving force which the European Parliament has been playing , even since before the September 11 attacks .
I do not need , either on behalf of my group or on behalf of my own Galician political organisation , to reiterate my categorical rejection and condemnation of terrorism .
It seems to me that we all agree that the problem of Palestine is at the root of international terrorism , and in any case , it is apparently the justification for this terrorism .
Today , Commissioner , it is not enough to simply imprison the terrorists .
Mr Vitorino and Mr Patten - who is not present - now is the time to come to this House , to tell us the problems relating to the development of this plan and identify those involved .
Mr President , this is a point of order .
I am simply talking about following the order of Question Time in this Chamber .
This kind of behaviour should not take place .
Mr President , I would like to say that the words of the speaker who preceded me are inadmissible .
I would like to ask you this : does the Council consider that it is fair and democratic for the Spanish government to claim that the citizens of Ceuta and Melilla do not want to be Moroccan because they are Spanish , while , on the other hand , at the same time refusing to allow the citizens of Gibraltar to decide freely in a referendum whether they want to be British or Spanish ?
The President-in-Office of the Council may respond as he sees fit .
We , the democratic Basque nationalists , have provided enough proof of our good will , our rejection of violence , our fight against terrorism and our defence of freedoms .
Mr President , I must confess that the President-in-Office of the Council was not very clear on this question .
The Commission has therefore proposed a new regulation in order considerably to reduce the number of people denied boarding and to improve protection for those concerned .
Ultimately , cancellation equates to universal denied boarding for an entire flight .
We are facing - as the sector is aware - the need to restructure the sector .
As several of you have pointed out , we are all significant users of this type of transport and therefore victims of low quality service .
However , we can accept Amendment No 40 - which Mrs Maes mentioned a moment ago - because it makes our position more flexible and means that we offer quantities which may be more balanced .
Finally , Amendments Nos 5 , 35 and 37 propose measures which are outside the scope of the Regulation we are discussing .
To this end a particular policy was considered by us to be positive insofar as it offered added value in terms of the cohesion of our societies and negative insofar as it increased inequalities between the Europeans .
Following tough negotiations , CAMELAR has now incorporated Canada and Mauritius with the status of associate members .
The proposal for a Decision requests ratification as soon as possible of the Rotterdam Convention , whose main objective is to regulate the international trade in hazardous chemicals , but also , and this is what we believe in Parliament , to protect human health and the environment , and it is important that this be done now .
The Regulation we are going to approve , on the prior informed consent procedure , is important because it gives the receiver prior information on what the sender is going to send .
This year we have been presented with a Commission proposal to extend the programme - which will expire on New Year 's Eve of this year - for a further five years , in other words , until 2007 .
I could not agree more with these three objectives , but I must make a few comments on the specific objectives in relation to VAT and direct taxes .
Nor in the field of direct taxes has the opportunity been taken - as the amendment we have not wanted to repeat says - to strengthen the relationship between taxation policy and other Community policies .
I would insist , however , that the broad objectives of the programme seem to me to be good ones : to understand the operation of the taxation systems and to cooperate between administrations in order to eradicate fraud .
The Commission proposal reflects these events in the priorities of our energy network policy and in the other provisions of the guidelines .
Lastly , with regard to all the consequences of enlargement , I would like to ask you to be patient .
I shall use this speech to request a clarification in the annex providing for natural gas networks
