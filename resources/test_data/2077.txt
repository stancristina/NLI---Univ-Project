Commissioner , this is a matter for you .
Do Commission officials have to defray the costs of damage they cause , themselves , at least as far as their financial means permit ?
How many times do we have to ask , urge , beseech - and I do not know what else - the Commission to get round to doing something at long last ?
It is conditional on the official being at least 50 years of age and having been in service for at least ten years .
As far as the first steps are concerned , it is absolutely vital to set up an investigative and disciplinary bureau within the Directorate-General for Personnel and Administration .
Indeed , there were repeated and emphatic demands from within this House for progress to be made and for something to be done about all the problems .
Yet whilst they reserve the right to make the decisions , they are not prepared to actually take on responsibility .
Secondly , this report by Mr Staes raises our hopes in two respects .
The Community Custom ' s Code has just recently been amended and the amendment has entered into force .
The criticism raised in the Special Report prompted the Commission to improve on and simplify four aspects relating to skimmed milk .
I will now turn to your report Mr Staes , for which the Commission is in your debt .
Here , too , I must confine myself to a few remarks .
The SMEs feel the effectiveness of union-wide initiatives for growth and employment , which are designed to underpin the measures introduced by the Member States .
How are these distinguished from one another and where must I , as entrepreneur , submit the applications for my project ideas ?
Exports constitute a risk of course , and so it is particularly important for joint ventures to receive financial support in the early stages , more than at any other time .
These are problems which cause the people to question the raison d ' Ãªtre of the European Union .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in yesterday ' s debate , the Commission explained why , and under what conditions , it can accept Parliament ' s amendments .
( Parliament adopted the resolution ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , unfortunately , Amendment No 5 to the draft directive on the reorganisation and winding up of credit institutions has received majority support .
On one side there is the European Union , which seeks to blame the Member States for shortcomings .
I should like to ask the House to accept these proposed amendments , because what we are trying to do here is to give the Member States more responsibility .
As far as the nitrates directive is concerned , Austria has now rectified its shortcomings , but we know only too well that the Member States had terrible trouble transposing the nitrates directive .
Time and again I hear farmers using various arguments to put off leaving their farms to their children or successors .
The tradition of handing farms down from one generation to the next is disappearing .
Essential services in the production of foodstuffs and raw materials , the development , further development and preservation of the countryside and the protection of the natural bases for life are all areas in which Europe will need farmers and young farmers in the future .
The Member States are responsible for deciding what priority should be given to promoting young farmers .
As expressly requested when these measures were discussed , the Commission is closely monitoring the market , including the export market , and the budgetary situation in this sector .
A special culling regulation for animals over thirty months old has also been introduced .
As you probably already know from the media , negotiations on a new form of collaboration in the fisheries sector were started with the Kingdom of Morocco following my visit to Casablanca in October , when the King of Morocco agreed to begin serious negotiations .
It gives me special pleasure , Commissioner Fischler , to be able to welcome you here today .
Mr Gallagher addresses this particular point in his report .
I think it is still too early for the European Parliament to commit itself one way or another .
You highlight the fact that European fishing is committed to the principle of multifunctionality , i .e . the principle of a sustainable fisheries economy which preserves fish stocks and protects the marine environment and makes an important contribution to the economic and social structures of coastal areas engaged in fishing .
To summarise , Mr Varela , your report makes an important contribution to the continuing debate on the future of the common fisheries policy .
Then , to create a fisheries sector which is both sustainable and economically viable and internationally competitive - while at the same time helping those who are forced to look elsewhere for work ; to develop a modern foreign fisheries policy which is closely coordinated with other Community policies in order to achieve responsible and rational use of resources , and , most importantly , to redevelop the Mediterranean dimension .
We really have done our utmost here .
These tests are not a sign of weakness but a sign of the credibility of democracies which investigate such matters and sweep nothing under the carpet .
We recently discussed the precautionary principle and put it to the vote , and we said that we must ban particular substances or procedures if there are justifiable concerns about them , even if there is no definitive proof .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , daily , and indeed almost hourly , we receive new information about potential dangers .
It is right and fitting that the European Union should help to
