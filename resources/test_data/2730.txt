an alternative to country of origin but a voluntary addition .
Even regions like Yorkshire , Britain' s premier region and coincidentally the region I represent , are not known by every citizen throughout the EU.
From a marketing and promotional point of view smaller areas and localities could be used , as well as regional breeds such as Aberdeen Angus .
The well established description of Scotch beef should continue to be used .
Small traditional butcher shops that sell beef unpackaged should be allowed to display information as an alternative to labelling each item .
Many consumers would be confused if given information about hanging or maturation , which could be mixed up with sell-by dates in their minds .
I would draw attention particularly to Amendment No 41 which seeks to exclude farmers from Community aid schemes if the regulation is not strictly adhered to .
I have already had cases drawn to my attention regarding other EU schemes where honest errors by farmers , who are not professional bureaucrats , have resulted in punitive sanctions which often threaten the future of a family farm .
We should not go down this road .
The listing of antibiotics and stimulants that might have been administered would , if adopted , create a two-tier beef market .
Animal welfare would be compromised as farmers would be reluctant to treat animals therapeutically .
Similarly , reference to fattening methods should not be introduced .
I hope that in amending this regulation Parliament can for once simplify rather than embellish and make the labelling of beef consumer-, butcher- and farmer-friendly .
Mr President , my group welcomed the report by Mr Papayannakis and salutes him for his persistence .
I say that because he comes from a small political group - and it is often hard to make headway here - and he comes from one of the southern Member States , which will in some ways have to make sacrifices and introduce regulations to bring about effective , proper beef labelling throughout the Community .
He has also had to face the obfuscation and delays brought about by the Council .
The fact that we have had to wait two years for this proposal to become a practical reality is a poor comment on the urgency with which they regard it , although the situation was plainly critical from the time of the outbreak of the BSE crisis onwards .
However , we are not here today for recriminations but for looking ahead .
This is our chance to put right this sorry process of delay .
Parliament has the opportunity , if it is willing to grasp it , to set a realistic timetable for the two-tier implementation of a comprehensive process of labelling for beef and for beef products .
In the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , we supported most of the amendments from the rapporteur and others and we do so again today .
We do that on the basis that the key proposal plainly has to be the issue of timing .
Some of the versions of this report in themselves have been contradictory in the dates that they gave .
We are now talking about implementation of the first stage in September 2000 and the second stage in September 2001 .
I was glad to hear the representative of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development say that they would settle for the four-month advance that would involve coming forward from January 2002 .
We believe that this is necessary because we should now get the whole European Union on the move .
That is why we want the second stage as set out in Article 13(5 ) to be distinct and a commensurate advance .
Why do we want that ?
There are some here - certainly some from Member States that have very effective traceability and labelling possibilities already - who would like to do the whole thing at once .
They would be able to say to others : look - you cannot do it , you are at fault .
Our job is to bring all 15 Member States together so that the process of traceability throughout the whole of the food chain , from the birth of the animal to its slaughter and disposal , would be universally applied throughout the European Union .
We say to those who are resistant to this : please remember that it is necessary to bring everybody on board .
What everybody wants - whether they are farmers , citizens or consumers in the United Kingdom or anywhere else in the Union - is to feel that they have equal confidence , wherever they are , in the safety of the product that they are consuming .
We have struck out the second subparagraph of Article 13(5 ) and all other amendments which follow the same line of allowing imprecise mixed origins or an indication such as "EU origin " .
One day "EU origin " may be assurance enough but it is not at this moment .
We need to know from which state a product has arrived .
I know that there are people in the Netherlands who disagree with that and I would be interested to know why .
I cannot see that "EU origin " is currently sufficient in the way of labelling and we are opposed to that proposal .
We are also opposed to the derogation for minced beef , which might apply to something like 30 % of the beef output , which ought to be open to labelling .
Minced beef is as much , if not more , at risk as any other form of beef since it frequently comes from a variety of sources .
It is the case in my country that we have seen minced beef and lamb and other meats mixed up together
