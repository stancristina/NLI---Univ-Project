I would oppose this directive on the basis that it is too prescriptive , it ignores what is actually going on in the car recycling market at the moment and it sets in stone methods which are not necessarily the best environmentally , and are certainly very damaging economically .
Madam President , as you know , the reason we are voting this report today rather than last week is because of the numerous and serious translation errors , particularly in the French version .
You have received a letter of complaint from me about the number of mistakes in this report and in other reports with which I have had dealings recently .
There is an error which has still not been corrected and that is on Amendment No 4 .
In the English version we refer to pharmaceutical and scientific organisations .
In the French version that becomes 'entreprises pharmaceutiques et organisations scientifiques ' .
Could you please make sure that French-speaking Members of this House know that the word entreprises is not correct .
It should not be in the amendment .
And , again , I urge you , Madam President , to look at the standard of translation that we are receiving currently .
- My party opposed this measure and the proposed amendments .
There are few things more certain in life than taxes , death and pollution .
However , there is also nothing more certain than EU environmental directives which have laudable intentions but which actually fail to achieve their stated objectives .
When it comes to pollution , like sin , we are all against it , but from there it is a far cry from believing that just because a measure is proposed against this evil it is necessarily good .
In fact , this directive , like so many others addressing environmental issues , is not good .
As is so often the case , it merely provides yet another massive bureaucratic structure to control a problem , which will only serve to create more jobs for officials , and cost the motor industries and consumers a great deal of money .
The one thing it will not do is solve the problem - it is a massive sledgehammer to miss a nut .
No one , not least my party , could begin to disagree that recycling should be encouraged , but the best way to achieve that is to work with the market , not to create another bureaucratic monstrosity .
Thus , a more appropriate way to encourage recycling is to tax manufacturers who do not increase the amounts of recoverable material in their vehicles , to encourage private sector recycling companies , through a package of tax incentives and assistance on complying with environmental requirements , and to incentivise the use of recycled materials .
Of course , these are areas where the EU does not have any jurisdiction and nor should it have such jurisdiction .
However , in the absence of these powers , it should not seek to substitute a less effective measure .
Instead , it should leave Member States to develop their own systems , and avoid the tendency to interfere where it is not wanted and can do no good .
Berger Report ( A5-0007/2000 )
- The European Parliamentary Labour Party has abstained on the final vote on the Leinen Dimitrakopoulos Report .
The text is overambitious , and Britain' s Labour MEPs believe that the IGC should primarily deal with the " Amsterdam left-overs " in order to prepare for enlargement , and not expand far beyond these .
There is currently a great deal of work under way in terms of reform and this must be the priority for the moment to allow consolidation and strengthening of the EU institutions .
Expansion of the agenda and drastic revision of the treaties would bring with it a risk of de-stabilisation .
The key factor in this text as it has been amended , is the call for a Charter of Fundamental Rights to be incorporated into the treaties .
In our view , this would bring with it a complex legislative burden , and it would be preferable to have a political and declaratory charter which explains to citizens what their existing rights are .
Our priorities ( i .e . the "left-overs " ) must be : the number and responsibilities of Commissioners weighting of votes in the Council extension of QMV in areas where it will benefit the UK and Europe ( but not Treaty change , defence matters , border controls or taxation ) , and extension of codecision wherever QMV is extended Beyond this , we have concerns that the "flexibility " or enhanced cooperation suggestion is not appropriate at present .
The provisions of Amsterdam are largely untested and allowing more scope for opt-outs could weaken the EU at the time when enlargement is being considered and applicant countries are being asked to sign up to single market and other European legislation .
Madam President , I am delighted and proud that this Parliament has , by an enormous majority , condemned the formation of the coalition in Austria incorporating Mr Haider ' s Freedom Party .
Mr Haider has demonstrated , over the past years by both words and deeds , that he deserves to be excluded from normal democratic discourse .
Not only has he admired Adolf Hitler , praised the Waffen SS , and refused to condemn a terrorist bombing that killed four Roma , but also in Carinthia has been a member of the regional government .
He has led efforts to end provision for Austria ' s Slovene-speaking minority and assistance to immigrants .
Some have said it is not right for us to interfere in Austrian politics .
They are wrong .
European Union Treaties make it incumbent on us to protect fundamental rights .
Some have said we
