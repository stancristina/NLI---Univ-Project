cannot conceal or make us forget that there is a lack of an ethical perspective in connection with stem cell research , in the way that Article 6 is worded .
But it would have been real proof that there was no desire to use embryos ad hoc for research in future .
As the latest data from UNAIDS demonstrate , the number of HIV infections is continuing to grow and , in some countries , we are even seeing a fresh outbreak of the virus .
Faced with all of this , patented drugs continue to be unaffordable , and the TRIPS agreements are creating an insurmountable obstacle to access to medicines , condemning almost three million people to death each year .
The creation of an international market in generic medicines , supported by a new system of medical research geared towards people 's real needs , remains the crucial issue .
It is also crucial to highlight the need to establish and enforce high European standards on quality in the social services , because the quality and fullness of people 's lives in the future will depend on the quality of service that they receive .
It is important to be quite clear about two things : the first is to realise whether you have actually got to the top , and the second is to prepare properly for the descent , which is often no easier than the climb up .
The Commission 's original proposal in fact stated that all substances subject to authorisation could be authorised on the basis of the principle of adequate control .
As for the descent from the summit , I think it is important to choose the best route , since the same grade of climbing difficulty may be a much greater challenge on the way down than on the ascent .
Where will they take us ?
A great many have taken part : I have known six presidencies and countless committee chairmen and commissioners , and I was always there as the lead climber , even though there were times when someone tried to pull me down instead of acting as my safety person .
All this distortion is supposed to have happened during the last night of negotiations .
I met the shadow rapporteurs before and after all the negotiating rounds ; I kept them informed ; and , right up to the last round , there was very broad agreement on the negotiating mandate that I took to the negotiating table .
I support the report by Mr McMillan-Scott and Mrs Flautre on the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights , because democracy is a fundamental universal right , and , as such , should be promoted by transnational institutions .
It is indeed a fact that most children today only eat products that are full of sugars and fats .
We wanted to incorporate this debate in the one on the general budget precisely because the return of EUR 7 billion is not a trivial matter , but one that ought to worry us .
It was our strong wish that this institute should be created with the backing of the representatives of the two largest parties within the European Parliament , precisely in order to benefit from this strength and support .
Above and beyond the debate regarding the location of the institute - in which we basically did not participate as a committee , and which has now been settled with the choice of Vilnius in Lithuania , which , I hope , regardless of its remoteness , will be able to provide us with a satisfactory outcome thanks to the wonders of science and technology - I would like to express my satisfaction concerning the fact that this institute will be launched immediately and that it will begin its work as early as 2007 .
We have encountered five presidencies ; the British Presidency at first reading and now the Finnish Presidency have played particularly decisive roles .
We have also got to know a number of Commissioners , because REACH was launched during the previous parliamentary term .
( Applause ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should just like to say thank you once again .
Draft amending budget No 6/2006 (vote ) 8.
After what Mrs Reding said , we hope that the PEGI ( Pan-European Game Information ) system will really become a body able to exercise more effective control .
What is needed is positive direction , which requires active political support and policies focused on cooperation and innovation instead of the purely commercial logic of privatisations and liberalisations , which all too often work in favour of speculative interests and not the public good .
I wish to thank you on behalf of my group , even though you know that we did not support your election , for reasons that clearly have nothing to do with you as a person , but I specifically wanted to thank you because you have always done your best to make this Parliament a credible forum for debate and to spread its values of democracy and harmony throughout the world .
Good luck !
I am thinking , for example , of how much we need it in my own country , not least because we believe that passengers should not be placed in different categories just because of the rail company they use .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I truly wish you all the very best for your first day as President .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the resolution on which we will vote tomorrow and this evening 's debate situate the European Parliament in that international movement that is appealing to the United Nations General Assembly to adopt a resolution for a universal moratorium , which is a first step towards the general abolition of the death penalty from the statute books of every country .
