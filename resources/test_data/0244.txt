Other matters receive far less attention , and useful rules remain hollow phrases .
The EU has largely adopted this free trade ideology .
- ( NL ) Nobody likes to pay taxes but , without taxes , our lives would be in chaos , and only the fittest would survive .
The list goes on .
Tougher sanctions must be used in order even further to isolate Mugabe internationally .
When will we finally have a generation of democratic leaders in Africa ?
