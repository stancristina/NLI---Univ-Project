The British Medical Association was saying that 15 % of junior doctors were leaving the profession citing stress , overwork and length of hours .
A lot of those were going to Australia and New Zealand where the working practices were better .
We have to stop that drain .
The nine-year timetable , of course , is an improvement on what the Council of Ministers wanted .
It is made up of four years ' implementation and five years to bring down the working time from 58 to 48 hours .
It is far better than what the Council wanted which was the 13-year period .
I , of course , would have preferred a shorter time .
As I have said before , our life is in their hands and it is important that we get this right .
The UK Government , of course , was part of the problem .
They maintain that they cannot achieve the reduction in this timescale .
I believe that they are wrong and that is why we have the extension for two years and also the extension after that for one year .
But as everyone else has said , it has to be in exceptional circumstances .
There must be rigorous notification and justification procedures and I hope that the British Government , and other Member State governments who feel that they can delay further by seeking two years and then another will feel so embarrassed that they will not seek to do so and meet the goal in nine years .
It is not twelve years - it is nine years and we must state that very , very clearly .
It is long enough - I would have liked it to have been shorter , but let us hope the governments , and the British Government in particular , adhere to that .
Mr President , I must apologise for this appearing to be a British show at this moment .
I assure you that it does change with the next speaker .
I also would like to thank Mrs Smet , our rapporteur , for the excellent work that she has done throughout this entire process .
With the support that she has received from Mr Rocard and from yourself , she has managed to make progress in face of the tensions between the high expectations of those whose lives will be affected by these decisions , some six million workers , and the difficulties and some intransigence presented by certain Member States .
I speak as my group 's representative on that parliamentary delegation and I know what I have seen .
This is a health and safety issue , as has been said , for both the workers concerned and for the public .
While I recognise , like others , that junior doctors are not the only group affected , this issue has proved the most difficult .
I have been deeply concerned at some of the arguments put forward by certain governments which have said that other aspects of health provision could be threatened if the reduction of working time for this group was brought in more quickly .
I cannot understand why it is less important for these workers to have reasonable working conditions and hours than any other group of health workers .
I want to know whether junior doctors in some countries are some sort of superhuman who can do without adequate rest and who will not harm their own health or that of their patients in the process .
The mother of one such trainee doctor said to me recently that she had been writing to the British Prime Minister and his wife , Tony and Cherie , to ask if they would be happy if their new baby were to be delivered by a tired , stressed-out doctor in a semi-drunken condition as that described by Mrs Lynne .
I consider that would be a real health and safety issue requiring rapid action .
As we have all said , we must be clear that nine years has to be seen as an absolute limit , that anything more is an aberration .
Any country not managing that should not be surprised if they find their staff moving elsewhere , to countries which have managed to implement more modern working conditions .
The stepped approach which has been brought in must not be used to simply give a redefinition of working time such as removing meal breaks or time spent on call but not actually treating patients .
That would simply be following the bad practices recently tried out by certain burger chains .
However , at least some of those chains pay their part-time 17-year-old staff more per hour than some junior doctors get in overtime payment .
I would like to congratulate in advance those Member States that will meet their obligations under this directive for all sectors .
The progress of others will be monitored very carefully .
I acknowledge the Commission 's role in this and hope that the Commissioner at that time will show the same commitment as that shown by Mrs Diamantopoulou .
Regretfully I am not sure that my group will be able to fully support the proposals overall despite the improvements that Mrs Smet and the Parliament team have been able to obtain in this very difficult situation .
Mr President , in previous debates here last November and in April of this year I supported the general principles behind the idea of directives on working time and I still do so .
Clearly there are significant health and safety issues which can be addressed - not only for the protection of workers but also for the protection of their customers and the general public - and issues of customer health and safety of course are particularly relevant in relation to doctors in training .
Like my colleague , Mrs
