I believe that we also have the same interest in the Union ' s communication and information activities being organised in as close proximity to the citizens as possible and in our applying the policy so that the various groups in society get the information which they most need .
I am curious as to how the Commission will go about the task .
The experts , the authorities and those who are genuinely interested in the EU should not have problems getting information , and I must admit that I am a little sceptical when I hear about an "interinstitutional " library in Brussels or similar central functions .
It is the Commission ' s local offices , in cooperation with Parliament ' s local offices , which must meet the man on the street , the man who always thinks that Brussels is so extremely far away .
It is a very difficult task because , in my opinion , the gap between the citizens and the institutions is wide , and with the major challenges which the Union is facing the task will become no less great .
I believe that you share many of my views , Mrs Reding .
Mr President , growth and employment in Europe depend to a large degree upon exploiting European infrastructure effectively .
We should therefore have already set in motion the TEN projects that have still to get off the ground .
It is no secret that I am very much in favour of a permanent link between Denmark and Germany , and I am glad that the new Danish Minister for Transport is also a supporter of the project .
There has previously been some doubt as to whether a permanent link across the Fehmarn Belt is the way forward , but any such doubt has now been shown to be groundless .
With a faster and easier link between Denmark and Germany , we can build bridges to the new democracies in the East .
We are building a bridge between countries to help industry and for human , political , social and cultural reasons .
There are almost always people who automatically say 'no ' to anything new .
One should not , however , be afraid of something good .
Finally , I should like to add my voice to the call to increase the budget appropriations for the trans-European transport networks , as they are quite inadequate .
Improved growth and employment require sums of a quite different order .
Since the Commission delved into the details on 27 April , perhaps we can be told how many men and women there are in category A posts , not in category A posts generally , but broken down by grade , i .e .
More often than not , it turns out that there are no women at all in top posts .
Perhaps in terms of country of origin , too , but in any case in terms of gender .
More often than not , it is exclusively men who carry out the final evaluation .
Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Deva for a very good report , of which it might be said that it is as long as the Commission ' s text is short .
It is the usual way things are debated in parliaments .
A report is submitted which says that we must now extend the regulation .
It is four months since it expired .
It is not a fair way of doing things , and I shall therefore , like Mr Deva and others , also listen to what Mr Patten has to say .
One simple little matter , which Mr Deva also emphasises , and which I too think we ought to discuss in the future , is the situation of women and children , which is , of course , extremely difficult and always will be in these situations .
According to the regulation , the Commission is obliged to prepare an annual evaluation for Parliament and the Council , something it has not done .
It is important that the programme should be extended , but not before we have seen the evaluations .
So where have they got to ?
An independent evaluation is needed for otherwise we have no guarantees that the money has been spent properly .
The purpose of the evaluation is , of course , to improve the future programmes .
It is this Directorate-General which has the expertise and it should therefore also have the responsibility .
It is indefensible and damaging to the programme that no effort is being made to introduce coherence .
Without this amendment , the Commission could get away with not having submitted a single evaluation report since the regulation came into force in 1997 .
However , he is only speaking for himself .
We are , of course , one of the small countries which are always oppressed , but we should like to be able to watch Danish television so that we can keep up with what is happening .
We are Europe ' s most important country .
We are simply the best .
But we cannot keep in touch with what is happening .
It is almost criminal how grossly the scheme has been misused , and we must put a stop to this .
Per-hectare aid for hemp is more than twice as high as that for cereals .
The desire to retain the high per-hectare aid for hemp is , in reality , a result of the very odd collaboration between , on the one hand , those who want to see cannabis legalised and , on the other hand , speculators in EU subsidies , for it is , in actual fact , impossible to see any difference between cannabinol-free hemp and the
