passenger safety , given the current climate in civil aviation .
( PT ) This is a proposal concerning a very technical and detailed regulation , which is intended to harmonise , in the name of air safety , the rules governing flight times and crew rest time , in order to ensure that all operators enjoy similar working conditions and common safety standards .
.
.
It is seeking thereby to guarantee coordinated action , together with an exchange of information that enables the early identification of possible problems , which I believe adequately reflects concerns about guaranteeing air safety .
There has been material damage too , with considerable damage to infrastructures , with roads and bridges destroyed , fields of crops flooded and the destruction of centuries-old cultural heritage .
I wish , therefore , to state my unequivocal support for establishing , in the short term , an exceptional budget line to deal with this type of disaster , redirecting Structural Funds that have already been allocated , bearing the new situation in mind , and for freeing up credits granted under the pre-accession programmes .
Of particular importance to the Canary Islands is the recent effort made to contain illegal immigration by sea .
The Community has contributed EUR 40 million of funding to this objective , to which the Moroccan authorities will add a further amount .
TEAM Europe was created by the European Commission in 1989 with the aim of providing a network of independent conference speakers whose expertise covers all fields of activity of the Union in all working languages .
However , they can accept expenses from the organisers of the event in which they are participating and even some appropriate payment .
.
The extent and the persistence of certain developments with regard to one particular country or another can lead the Commission to propose that the regulation be amended .
Following up the conclusions of the Seville European Summit , the Commission sent a questionnaire to the Member States , in the aim of re-examining the lists of third countries annexed to the aforementioned regulation .
Thank you very much , Mr Nogueira Rom√°n , but I could not agree with you more , for all of the reasons you have given and for one more , which explains why we are speaking almost the same language .
Nevertheless , selling below cost is a commercial stratagem which will , sooner or later , be tolerated by consumers .
Furthermore , we have seen that the commercial strategy of predatory pricing is not controllable simply by applying the general rules on unfair competition .
I particularly welcome the fact that the European Parliament acknowledges the success of the actions already undertaken and is warming to the idea that the programme must continue beyond 2003 .
Nevertheless , within the scope of the Treaties in their current state , the Commission has no alternative but to initiate actions against violence under Article 152 .
Since I am one of the representatives of the Commission in the Convention , I shall certainly support Parliament 's request when the matter is discussed in the Convention .
Therefore , the rapporteur 's request for an increased budget is in line with the observations made by the Commission , especially if we bear in mind the expected increase in work in this field , following the accession of the candidate countries .
In fact , following a request by the European Parliament , this new action to create a network of European experts in the field of fundamental rights under budget line B-5850 in 2002 , which the Commission has already started to finalise , will enable a close relationship to be established between this network of experts and the objectives of the Daphne programme , in addition to emphasising something that is of considerable importance .
Furthermore , as the report states - and I must congratulate the rapporteur - in the European Union around 500 000 people per year , the majority of whom are women and children , are victims of trafficking in human beings for the purpose of sexual exploitation , which also requires more effective measures in the fight against all forms of violence and in supporting victims , including increasing the financial means that are currently earmarked for this purpose .
The only substantial answer that I should like to give at the moment concerns funding .
As long as we have to work within the scope of Article 152 we shall continue to have problems .
Employment is the European Union 's number one priority .
More than 60 million people are living at risk of poverty .
.
In fact , in a field which is increasingly important to Europe 's citizens , who are already aware of the importance of managing , rationalising and protecting their environment , we are still seeing on a regular basis , brutal attacks on what is everyone 's cultural heritage .
We also support the rapporteur 's proposals on the rehabilitation and treatment of aggressors , on undertaking comparative studies into legislation and punishment , on approaches to the problem of prostitution , to undertaking educational programmes which show that violence against women and children is unacceptable and on the creation of a common database on eliminating violence against women .
Nevertheless , this law was adopted under international pressure , and not as a result of any greater awareness , which means that there are almost no measures in place to implement the law .
( PT ) There is an enormous gap between the declarations of good intent proclaimed in the Social Agenda and the way in which these are put into practice , as proved in the report itself , despite some weaknesses and some specific negative points with which we disagree and hence our abstention in the final vote
