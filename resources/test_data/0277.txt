The Commission has promised to decide on a risk assessment study for the whole of the EU area .
A process has been discovered .
Now it just needs to be put into practice .
According to certain studies in EU Member States , the soil 's cadmium content is already very high .
We have been monitoring the use of selenium for years .
Studies show that the increase in selenium has had an excellent effect on the state of the health of domestic animals and the population .
Finally , I would like to state that tighter standards to promote human and animal health cannot be allowed to seen as hindrances to business ; the EU has to find a place for them .
I wish Mr Bangemann would listen ; you obviously have a headphone .
I have to make it clear that the Commission has done its bit , but old Member States have dragged their heels , so this proposal by Parliament is totally realistic and feasible for all parties concerned .
These standards apply to animal transportation loads of under eight tonnes .
In fact , many decisions on animal welfare taken in this Parliament are , properly speaking , outside the jurisdiction of Parliament , as the issue is mainly the application of the common agricultural policy .
On that , Parliament mainly gives an opinion and then the Council does whatever it does and often then does a bit of horse trading , because one demands unanimity .
Because of that , it is very important for Parliament now to use this opportunity to the best advantage .
It is obviously not a matter of being able to solve problems of animal welfare with technology , but this can have a very important part to play .
Actually , it is likely that demands for animal welfare will become more stringent in the future , certainly not slacker .
All the proposals contained in the report are fully capable of being achieved with modern materials and technology , and that goes for gentler sloping ramps too .
There has been some discussion on them in Parliament , but the manufacturers have said that such things are possible and that the strain factor is reasonable .
The issue of the ramps is a vital one .
We should mention as a separate matter that pigs , which in many ways are like people and are very sensitive and intelligent animals , are extremely sensitive to loading arrangements and sawdust .
Better planning as well as the surveillance of transportation are very important and , for this reason , we propose that these vehicles should be checked at three-yearly intervals .
Mr President , congratulations to my colleague , Mrs Hautala , on a very well-informed report .
I am extremely satisfied with the report 's amendments , the implementation of which would mean less stress for animals while being loaded onto vehicles and during transportation .
Conditions for transportation differ widely in the EU area , owing , for example , to differences in climate .
I am very glad that the report includes mention of an obligatory loading lift for sheep and pigs , which I had already proposed to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
Requirements for equipment and its use go hand in hand .
That is why I think it is important that the authorities in Member States are given sufficient powers to monitor transportation .
The next goal must be to extend these requirements now under discussion to cover equipment already being used over a given period of transition .
The Commission 's proposal mentions that the date of the next check due should be displayed on the vehicle 's registration plate .
Animal transportation in the EU has attracted a lot of negative publicity , which does not benefit anyone .
Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report .
And to a large extent it will continue .
I have myself slaughtered animals and been employed in the transportation of animals , so I do know a bit about the subject .
We must give due consideration to inhumane conditions for animals for slaughter , as it goes on with the support of the Union .
We have to give consideration to loading and unloading as has been stated .
While drafting the directive , we have to take into consideration the need , too , to take account of internal differences within the Union , like those that exist between the North and the South .
Ladies and gentlemen in the front row , it would be important to put an end to the transportation of live animals for slaughter across the continent .
Meat is not affected by travel .
Mr President , I wish only to tell Mr Bangemann that I have a pretty good knowledge of geometry , and , besides , I studied agriculture at university .
This is actually a very simple technique .
Do you think that will be of any benefit to the manufacturers ?
I wish you all success for the presidential term .
Regarding the matter of homosexual and lesbian discrimination , Article 13 in the Amsterdam Treaty prohibits discrimination in respect of sexual orientation , and in this connection it is important also , in accordance with Article 13 , to review the Staff Regulations .
Your laws as they relate to homosexuals are clearly unsatisfactory .
Madam President , first I should like to congratulate Mrs Weiler on her excellent report .
The EU 's four basic freedoms have until now only embraced the free movement of the workforce .
It is still a question of people , however , people who have human needs and feelings .
The fact that they should want to move can be due to other factors than changing
