ought instead to take up the important task of ensuring that the essential issues which need to be resolved are debated in such a way that Europe ' s citizens are involved and can form their own views on the important subjects being debated .
The debate in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , which adopted the draft report with a very small majority , plus the fact that more than 200 amendments have been tabled for consideration in plenary , show that this report cannot contribute to creating a common basis for the IGC.
However , we would like to draw particular attention to the points which we think the IGC should concentrate on .
As regards the composition of the Commission , it is important that all States have the right to a Commissioner with the same rights and obligations , particularly as in our opinion , the Commission must continue to enjoy the right of initiative .
This can be achieved by laying down requirements for a certain number of votes in the Council which must , at the same time , represent a simple majority of the total population of the Union .
We are open to discussing increased use of qualified majority voting , although we do not consider that it should be the rule .
Each particular instance of a transition to qualified majority voting must , however , be analysed and debated thoroughly and a balance struck between what is fundamental as far as the individual Member States are concerned and the need to make cooperation work .
All Member States must demonstrate the political will to make cooperation work .
We are not , therefore , worried that , following enlargement , the EU will be paralysed unless a thorough reform of the Treaty is carried out now .
These discussions are far from complete , and we do not think that the European Parliament should table amendments to the Treaty before the outcome is known .
In this area , the EU must focus in particular on conflict prevention and civil crisis management .
We would like once again to stress that we want a charter in the form of a political document and that it should not be raised at the IGC with a view to incorporating it into the Treaty .
Mr President , Turkey is now standing at a crossroads .
It can choose the past , it can choose oppression and barbarity , or it can choose the future , freedom and humanitarianism .
Akin Birdal has now been imprisoned for such a statement , in spite of his ill-health .
We must say to the Turkish Government that the policy which the country is conducting belongs to the past .
Such a country will never achieve the unity which it desires .
Most recently , we discussed the Mumia Jamal case , and now it is the Juan Raul Garza case , among others .
In this way the USA has brought itself into line with China , Congo and Iraq .
Mr President , for years I have been calling for the school milk scheme to be changed .
I think it is complete nonsense .
Currently , full-cream milk is fully subsidised , semi-skimmed milk is semi-subsidised and skimmed milk receives no subsidy .
We should instead award subsidies per pupil .
In the longer term we must change the EU 's agricultural policy so that we can put an end to artificial excess prices and surplus stocks .
It is not just beneficial to farmers .
Children do not need so much fat .
There is an enormous amount of administration involved in the present scheme .
I have received many complaints from schools which cannot work out how to administer the scheme .
It is a real science calculating the fat percentages in milk and cheese .
It is not that they are out to cheat ; they simply cannot work out how to administer the scheme .
The scheme which he is recommending is administratively and nutritionally the only correct one .
Mr President , I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur , Mr Maat , for his report , which I support in its entirety .
I would also like to thank my good colleague and close friend , Freddy Blak , of the Socialist Group , for his support for my amendment .
Children and infants must learn healthy eating habits , and milk , with its protein and calcium content , is a very important part of this .
There are various traditions relating to which dairy products are consumed , and the scheme is simplified by awarding the subsidy on the basis of a quarter of a litre of milk per pupil per school-day .
For products other than full-cream milk , the subsidy should be calculated on the basis of low-fat solids or a maximum butterfat content of 50 % .
In this way the scheme takes account of the differences in the milk traditions which exist in the different Member States .
I am just so tired of being accused of not wanting to do my job because I am taking part in this action .
That is not a serious way of doing things .
What we are asking for is simply confirmation of whether we are observing Parliament ' s own rules .
Enlargement to include the countries of Eastern and Central Europe is the biggest challenge in the Community ' s history , and if we do not tackle the issue correctly now , we are putting a lot at risk .
An information and communication strategy must , therefore , be high on our agenda .
I am looking forward with great interest to hearing your answer , Commissioner Reding , because I know that information is also of great interest to you : an interest which we share , moreover , because we are both journalists by profession
