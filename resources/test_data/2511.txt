What is more , farmers in various parts of Europe do not always enjoy a very good income .
Less than 10 % of the world 's agricultural production ends up in international trade .
They want to support and protect their agricultural sectors and the development of the countryside in order to offer their rural population some security of existence .
This is why , in addition to the anti-dumping measures , technical assistance for these countries is of great importance .
Because agriculture still does not operate like a bicycle factory , we need appropriate protection at our borders .
If we brought this down to 100 % , we would free the world market from dumped sugar and milk powder and we would at the same time offer our farmers a better price .
Secondly we would like to see production subsidies in the European agricultural policy converted into public grants for nature conservation and new economic activities in the countryside ( recreation , ICT , animal welfare ) .
What we would like to see is over 30 % off the tariffs , and in 30 % less time .
Madam President , my group is also very happy with the proposed directive as well as with the report .
An important part of this is naturally the fact that many people wanting to travel within the EU or who want to go and live in another country will not want to do this on their own but with their families or their partners .
I think that the most important thing is that people are committed to each other , that people want to take responsibility for each other , that people want to care for each other , and I think that it is therefore absurd that we want to disrupt family life because there is a certain official signature missing .
I find this pronouncement just as surprising as the term ' European citizenship ' .
I cannot support the amendments in the Santini report that extend the definition of partner and that tone down the Commission 's amendments .
Imagine what it must feel like .
This freedom of choice must not , however , be lost when these citizens cross the border .
I compliment Mr Marset Campos , particularly on the way in which he maintained a consistent line in the report , a line consistent with all Parliament 's statements and actions over the past few years .
That is a shame , because this is something we need to do , not least on account of our future borders with the country .
Do the Russians actually intend to create a union with a country whose leadership has such a poor reputation with the European Union and the other European organisations ?
More than 60 % of trade between the European Union and Russia already travels through Belarusian territory .
Belarus under Lukashenko is far removed from that .
In the consciousness of the inhabitants of the 15 Member States , every citizen of a Member State is free to visit the territory of another Member State and to stay there for a long period of time or even undertake paid work there .
( NL ) Visas are a way for governments to torment people .
People think that their passports will get them into other countries but they are refused entry because they come from a country that is regarded as too hostile , too poor or too far away .
I think that this is one of the major advantages that Parliament 's proposal has over that of the Council and the Commission .
The entry into force of the directive on infrastructure charging and the end of the points system will therefore be linked only if the charging directive enters into force before the end of 2006 .
The ecopoint system for the Alps , which aims to protect the local environment , sets the unjust local Austrian special position against the right of free movement of goods , and means that I am no champion of the current system .
It would just create extra traffic in these countries , with too little benefit to the European environment , as traffic would have to make detours .
Because the solution that is now being proposed consists of a combination of quotas , bans and charges , the majority of my group will still give it the benefit of the doubt for 2004 , but the problem cannot be solved without building a railway tunnel under the Brenner Pass .
The end of Austria 's ecopoint system is only acceptable if another kind of protection is brought in for the whole of the Alpine region and not just for Austria , one which has its basis in the Alpine Convention .
I have a question regarding heading 6 of the financial perspective .
A general point to begin with : the White Paper outlining the policy lines for European transport policy up to 2010 has one major shortcoming , in my opinion : it lays too much emphasis on rail transport , as if that were the only real means of transport of the future .
Inland waterway transport , which , in some parts of Europe , has greater potential to relieve the pressure on road transport than the train , is given practically no attention in the White Paper .
We are not against this , therefore , Mr Swoboda .
Mr President , I should now like to take up two important points : the European Road Safety Agency and the establishment of a European transport fund .
Procedurally , we in the European Parliament are bound by this report .
The methodology of cross-taxation with a view to transferring the pressure away from road transport to the other modes of transport must not be allowed
