in the Commission about low morale and low motivation , and clearly that is a major concern .
Big expectations are built up for these reforms both within the Commission and outside .
And if we are to move forward , I suggest to you that the reforms on the personnel side , early evidence of change of culture , empowerment and motivation of staff have to happen sooner rather than later .
And if we look at the original proposals - and I suspect that we will see the same in the new ones - it was not until 2002 that we were going to complete overall reform of the Staff Regulations .
Indeed , it was not until 2001 that some of the key elements of appraisal were going to be introduced .
I suggest that is too long , and we really must move forward much more quickly than that .
The second point that I want to make concerns information technology .
Have you really taken into account the changes in staff structure that new information technology will bring about , because those will be fundamental in the new direction of these reforms .
On the second part of Mr Harbour ' s question , he will see in the course of this year how with greater precision we will be showing how the application more extensively of information technology will facilitate change , not only in terms of the working practices and conditions of the staff but in the operation of the Commission , as the President briefly outlined in his statement .
Could I thank Mr Harbour for the energetic commitment that he has shown to the issue on which he is rapporteur and respond to him by saying that we firmly believe that the morale , the motivation and the professional commitment of Commission officials , which is already very strong , will be enhanced by the introduction of comprehensive training , the allocation of responsibility , the upgrading of management and a number of other changes which we will be introducing .
Cultures are products of structures and systems , and the structures and systems have become old .
By renovating those structures and systems , in some cases very radically , we will assist the people of the Commission who are strongly committed to the European ideal and have high quality of capability to release talents and manifest themselves as never before .
I would like to make one last point in answer to Mr Harbour .
I share his impatience to secure the full implementation of the mechanisms of reform and change practices .
I wish I could honestly say to him that we will be compiling and providing in the form of proposals communications before 2001 and certainly be putting them into effect before 2002 , but he will be aware there are legally required consultation procedures and periods which we must respect .
I do not use those as an excuse .
We indeed take huge encouragement from the very positive and constructive response offered in the consultation over the last month and I believe therefore that although there may be a slight delay in the compilation and application of reforms , these reforms will nevertheless be strengthened by the extent of understanding and commitment that will be produced by the consultation which we will undertake assiduously .
I would like everything to happen much more quickly .
It is better to do it absolutely properly .
I am grateful to Mrs Maes for not only the comments that she has made now but the sustained commitment that she has shown to change ever since she came into this House .
Can I assure her that our attitude is not guided by any motivation to farm out .
We are concentrating on core tasks and we are concentrating on priorities , not in order to evade any obligations but to absolutely guarantee that we can totally fulfil the central obligations that we have .
One of those obligations very clearly - and I am at one with Mrs Maes in this - is in the preparation for effective , smooth , calm enlargement that will work to the mutual benefit both of the people of the incoming countries and of the citizens of the current Union .
One of the reasons for having to ensure that we focus very strongly and sharply on our priorities is to be able to guarantee that we can fulfil that absolutely critical role of being the agents of enlargement to maximum effect .
Can I say to her that the mechanisms that we are going to introduce of strategic planning and programming facilitated by activity-based management may sound to be immensely dry and completely bereft of any idealism .
Since I was brought up to believe that the victory of ideals needs to be organised , I may be able to make an appeal to her to understand and support our mechanistic view of this because it is for the great and central purposes of the Union and its enlargement .
I hope that , in terms of the degree of cooperation and partnership that we can enjoy in all aspects of this policy with the Council and with Parliament , not only will we get rapid implementation of policy development in the most effective way , but that we will be able to do it by coordination at the right time which will produce the maximum benefit for the Union .
I do believe that reform with all it implies , including the new mechanisms , will very strongly facilitate changes of that kind .
I want to thank Mr Cox and indeed his group for the way in which several Members have strongly engaged themselves and interested themselves in the detail of reform which can sometimes be rather trying but is always , as he indicated , worthwhile
