, of course , that national taxation would possibly be in conflict with EU law , and so the problem has not been solved .
Mr President , quite a few speakers have already today pointed out that , in many countries , unemployment has taken a turn for the worse and is rising .
That is due to the generally poor economic situation , but also to the fact that insufficient efforts are being made to promote adaptability in the labour market .
Training has an important role to play in this process , and I should like today to call for employment policy also to be seen in the context of the initiatives launched jointly by the EU 's education ministers with a view to improving the quality of training schemes through their open coordination .
A report , summarising the situation , will of course be produced by the autumn and debated at the Spring Summit in 2004 .
There is nothing contradictory about this , as parts of this Parliament perhaps appear to believe .
There was a need for this .
I should therefore like to have seen Parliament be more sparing with the welter of amendments , even though our rapporteur has made great efforts to boil matters down to something comprehensible .
We need to focus on the objective : more employment and more jobs in Europe .
The agreements between the United States and the EU are , of course , really about integrating the EU countries ' and the United States 's criminal law and rules of criminal procedure or , at any rate , essential aspects of these .
These agreements represent the current low point in the development of the EU 's legal policy .
Note that the only professional investigation implemented by the institutions of the EU concerning these crucial issues of legal policy are open to serious criticism on the grounds of principle due to the fact that , in the context of the rights that are a crucial part of our democratic basis of values , the EU 's acts violate a range of basic principles in the fields of criminal law and procedure .
Has anyone within the EU system attended to the criticism by the group of experts that the acts compromise legal certainty ?
As I say , these agreements make matters still worse .
Quite a few speakers have referred to the scandal in Guantánamo Bay , where EU citizens are being detained and mistreated under circumstances that decisively violate international law and basic legal principles .
The American investigation services will , moreover , subsequently be permitted to operate within the Member States .
A year 's secret negotiations were conducted in advance and , as the Council put it , protecting the Council 's negotiations was a more important interest than democratic scrutiny .
Can we sink any deeper ?
No one wishes to see them repeated , but it would be almost as tragic to see them exploited for the purposes of violating fundamental human rights and guarantees of legal certainty by which , as EU citizens , we are normally protected .
According to the agreements , European citizens who are alleged to have committed a crime carrying a sentence of at least one year may be extradited to the United States - a country that , as many have pointed out , practises the death penalty .
The large intensive farms receive the most aid , leading to environmental damage and reduced animal welfare .
The consumer pays twice : he or she pays via tax for the aid and then pays the artificially high prices for everyday goods .
Reform of EU agricultural aid is therefore more necessary than ever .
The June Movement believes that the only real way forward is to abolish discrimination by creating equal conditions through cutting back on agricultural aid with a view to phasing it out entirely .
This can be achieved by stipulating that no more than 70 % of the aid is to go to the actual acreage , a target that can be reached by removing the higher amount of aid for protein crops and by promoting extensification by setting an upper limit of 0.5 units of livestock per hectare .
The cutbacks must restrict the artificial structural development whereby the large intensive farms receive the largest amount of aid .
The cutbacks must also create better conditions for livestock .
Better conditions for the developing counties can be created by phasing out sugar aid and direct aid for exports .
Instead of increasing aid by 100 % for the new countries in 2013 , the old countries should receive 25 % less aid in 2013 .
Mr President , I should also like to say a big thank-you to Mr Sjöstedt for his outstanding work on putting into effect the Catagena Protocol on Biosafety in Europe .
Mr Sjöstedt has shown considerable openness and a very great desire to achieve results , but I also think that the Commission and the Council - during both the Danish and Greek Presidencies - have made very positive contributions so that we can now avoid protracted discussion in the Conciliation Committee .
We are now obtaining a high level of protection in relation to the rules for the export of GMOs from the EU.
They are in the position of being able to exercise genuine choice in connection with the import of GMO products , even though they may of course be thought to be exposed to quite aggressive marketing from parts of industry .
This means , for example - and I see this as the most important thing of all - that there can be no export of GMOs without the express consent of the country of import .
Express consent is also required , something that I think has been quite crucial in these negotiations
