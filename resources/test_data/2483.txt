the Council , employment issues have been accorded the importance they deserve in European Union policy , and at the Cologne summit Germany will be making efforts to push through the European employment agreement .
In pushing through the European strategy on employment it is vital to get to grips with measures that can provide added value for national efforts .
The people of Europe have been concerned , alarmed and puzzled that another war seems to be developing in the Balkans , where small children and the elderly are the ones who are suffering .
The European Union must take more overall responsibility in order to ensure that the situation in the Balkans grows more stable and allows different groups to coexist .
One important ingredient in this programme is the approval and practical application of the recommended measures to be taken within the context of the northern dimension .
His appearance in the European Parliament was not enough to reassure me that he would be the right person to lead the Commission during the next five-year term .
He repeatedly stressed the need to deregulate the labour market and to increase the practice of bilateral agreements between employers and workers .
Mr Prodi sets great store by a common defence policy for Europe .
With the situation as it is , it is important that the new Commission should begin work as soon as possible .
We do not believe the matter can be postponed any longer , but feel that this vital reform should be introduced before the start of the new Parliament .
The Conservative and Socialist groups in Parliament , through their action today , have jeopardised the credibility of the European Parliament by rejecting the proposal for a Members ' statute put forward by the Liberal Group .
The Liberal Group 's proposal was a realistic one , and would have made it possible to reach an agreement with the Council of Ministers before Parliament rose for the elections .
In the course of our work , the Liberals have consistently pressed for an accelerated timetable of reforms .
The fact that some groups , so close to the finishing post , have been intransigent and in no hurry for reform , also leaves one feeling bitter .
The European Parliament would also have been able to reinforce its legitimacy by not having the sole right of approval of its own salaries , like other parliaments .
Mr Verheugen , you may have noticed that on 23 March the European Parliament indicated its desire for a substantially greater proportion of women Members of the next Commission than there is at present .
The Commission 's new President , Mr Prodi , has already discovered that we in the House are quite serious about this .
But is it your intention to negotiate with the Member States ?
When EU aid is being allocated and prioritised , it is important to pay particular attention to matters of the environment and health .
Instead , some degree of flexibility is required when allocating EU aid .
This is especially important in developing networks linking government , businesses and organisations .
All in all , prioritisation is important , but it has to be achieved through viable cooperation with the applicant countries .
For that reason , the administration process must not be allowed to become too ponderous , especially when we consider how relatively meagre the resources are .
The report on the Union 's northern dimension states that the issue of the northern dimension must figure in all decision-making connected with the Union 's internal development , in accordance with the resolutions of the Vienna European Council .
Through negotiation the EU 's northernmost farming regions , which are also the world 's northernmost farming regions , gained a few important concessions to compensate for the costs incurred because of natural problems .
The fields are covered in snow in April , whether they are thirty or two hundred hectares in size .
It was still nearly ten degrees below zero in my home region just this morning .
Why should those who reap the best harvests receive many times more in aid payments than those whose harvests are small because of the natural conditions ?
Mr President , regional policy is central to the equitable development of the European Union .
The Member States have the ultimate responsibility for acting wisely .
The bottom line must be safeguarding employment and welfare in different parts of the continent .
Regional development policy has to be all-embracing , motivating , and it must promote enterprise .
The fact that talks led to results in a situation in which the Commission had already resigned is proof of the viability of the Union .
Mr President , Mrs JÃ¶ns ' report , I believe , is a good one , since although she too urges the Council to approve the agreement negotiated by the social partners , she at the same time strongly criticises that agreement .
The most important is the issue of extending legislation to cover other forms of atypical work , such as homeworking and hired labour , which have become much more common of late .
Thus discrimination against those undertaking atypical work is at the same time a form of gender discrimination on the labour market .
Ending this should be a priority task for the Union .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this is an important directive , and will play its part in building the information society .
I believe , however , that the big problem with the Internet is the protection and freedom of the individual .
In this respect we have entered a new era , and it must therefore be possible to opt out or opt in .
We must be able to put a stop to this .
