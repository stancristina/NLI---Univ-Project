be the year in which the action plan will be presented to the Commission .
We are talking about transparency and there is also a need for common courtesy .
The Community rules and the obligations arising from the fight against fraud must be implemented in the same way by all countries .
I should like to emphasise a few points , the main one being the meeting of minds with Commissioner Kallas , particularly as concerns the nature of the regulatory mechanisms governing the disbursement of funds .
There can be no doubt that this cooperation , this willingness and desire to stamp out a phenomenon that does enormous damage to the European Community is motivated solely by political concerns .
However , this is a new challenge which calls for well-balanced efforts without giving way to the natural human temptation - inevitable , given the attacks we have suffered in the years since 11 September - to generalise or to build a Fortress Europe , or to sideline a priority that is central to the process of EU integration , namely the safeguarding of fundamental rights .
That is why we believe it is essential to move in the three directions set out by this report .
As the Vice-President has said , we must also fight in favour of , and protect , the millions - tens of millions - of European citizens who profess a religion different from our own , as well as the Muslim non-Community citizens who have always lived by the rules of our democracy and complied with our laws , which makes them worthy of our full respect .
If we are able to give European industry better access to international markets , we will enable companies to grow , invest in know-how and technology , and create more jobs .
Multilateral action , the most effective type of action owing to the number of countries involved but also the most difficult , therefore needs to be accompanied by agreements identifying and resolving the inconsistencies connected with the existence of unwarranted obstacles in third countries . on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Prime Minister , the delicate phase of ratification has finally begun , and we hope that they will take place very rapidly .
Any other choice would deprive Europe of its independence and self-sufficiency .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I support the document presented by the European Commission for a new partnership with the countries of Central Asia , but I would like to highlight the following aspects .
Today the Commission has started to rectify this , partly due to the pressure applied by Parliament .
However , a great deal , a very great deal , can be done and I thank the Commission for proposing in the last two years , and then last September in a specific communication , a series of measures that are analysed and evaluated in my report , and on which I would like to make a few comments .
Could we really not have taken a different attitude to prevent this situation arising ?
Mr President , at the end of the debate , I will speak again for two minutes to finish my speaking time .
Otherwise the suspicion could take root that the priorities have been chosen because you want to get rid of the inconvenient infringements .
Because if we organise sessions where we discuss the application of directives and the Commission official who attends remains silent or tells us things that are of little interest - perhaps because he cannot say what we really want to know - then the whole exercise becomes pointless .
We are beginning to talk about pension schemes , and we are beginning to say there should be more children , and that mothers should be given more help .
It had a difficult birth , but was then approved and applied and , while it has had some success in recent years , there have been practical gaps and inadequacies .
It is on those two points - costs and democratic accountability - that Parliament 's delegation focused its attention during the conciliation stage of this procedure .
As matters stand , we have merely compared recipes .
I believe that we are both aware that there are still two major problems .
We have fielded all the possible arms : codecision , enhanced comitology , simple comitology .
An own initiative report cannot tackle all the questions raised by transport , energy and the environment in an exhaustive way .
Amendment 6 asks the Commission to intervene to set a single speed limit for European motorways in all countries .
Personally , I was and am not against the possibility of looking at this issue at the appropriate time in June .
The fact is , however , that the volume of CO2 emissions from transport increased by 32.1 % between 1990 and 2005 , and the volume emitted by air transport rocketed by 90 % over the same period , while emissions of the climate-killer carbon dioxide from all other areas of activity were reduced by 9.5 % in accordance with the aims of the Kyoto Protocol .
We should perhaps take a more general view , especially as regards CO2 emissions and the CO2 generated by other sectors of our industrial civilisation .
Since the Committee has recorded that everything is in order , Parliament may ratify all the mandates . on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we are among those who believe in and defend the continuation of the CAP even after 2012 .
At the same time , however , we believe that the European Union must call upon Turkey to put an immediate end to its invasion of northern Iraq
