How will that be defined ?
Further to this general answer , with thanks for your remarks , I shall be attentive to your criticisms or your proposals when you have had time to peruse this document .
Finally , I would like to thank Professor Tsatsos for having mentioned the connection between these proposals and the role of the European Parliament .
The purpose of this speech is not , let me repeat , to foreshadow the conditions for the execution of the Commission ' s work programme .
Finally , I should like to tell Mr Jonckheer that , for all sorts of reasons , I absolutely agree with him on the matter of citizenship .
The Commission considers that all the institutional matters liable to have a connection with the work of the Intergovernmental Conference should in fact come within the scope of the debate which has been initiated .
The simple answer , Mr President , is 'yes ' .
As the questioner indicates , we should ask whether the restriction associated with the expression 'essentially all products ' may be retained for very much longer as soon as we consider granting these countries total access to our markets .
I suppose , then , that the Council will be reluctant to require assent because the Council is not in the habit of going much further than is required by the Treaties in terms of consultation with Parliament .
Although the designations are fairly similar , there may be very different tariff items .
If so , what are the criteria used by the Commission in order to determine the amount of timber eligible for such aid ?
This raises problems for us at several phases of the incineration process : the reception , processing and handling of the waste .
It is completely unrealistic to wish to review the limit values of this directive every three years , if one considers the considerable investment that the industry would have to make .
They therefore now have to be made to run profitably , leading to an increase in the volume of dangerous substances transported , with all the risks that this entails .
Denouncing racism , including racist talk , does not mean censoring the freedom of opinion as some would have us believe .
The best is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Geneva Convention .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in view of our discussion of these reports on human rights inside and outside the European Union , the time is therefore right to consider the cross-influences between the 'inside ' and the 'outside ' .
This really is a case of fundamental rights .
What do these concepts cover ?
Yet the problem with this supposed antiracism is not its search for truth or even its support for migrants ...
Madam President , please note that the French socialists in the House will not take part in the vote as we consider that the tabled motion is not impartial .
Although we do not share the protectionist concerns hiding behind the defence of 'real chocolate ' , we do not see any reason to vote for the Commission directive .
Firstly I must congratulate the rapporteur on his tenacity in this 'chocolate ' issue .
I myself am a consumer who is concerned about the quality and taste of traditional chocolate .
What is even more astonishing is that this same Europe produces mad cows , sheep with scrapie and chickens containing dioxin and imports hormone-treated beef and genetically modified cereals .
In terms of chocolate , as in other areas , different cultures and traditions exist .
Everyone has different tastes .
Where a clear and unambiguous labelling obligation would have been sufficient to allow the marketing of all the types of chocolate available in Europe , one of those grotesque compromises at which we are so adept has been proposed .
The 1973 directive clearly and unambiguously defined chocolate as a product made with sugar and cocoa .
To achieve their aim of being able to produce and sell imitation chocolate under the name of chocolate at a lower price throughout the Union , these multinationals have worked ceaselessly to make the 1973 derogations the rule , regardless of the interests of chocolate makers and cocoa producers .
In all countries and for all consumers with a taste for real chocolate , the name 'chocolate ' can now legally cover a completely different product .
Waste management is a very complex issue subject to extensive lobbying .
These plants must be subject to very strict control standards , at least as strict as those imposed on incinerators .
However , at the same time , the European Parliament would be well-advised to come up with realistic ways of achieving objectives which are feasible , rather than allowing its lyrical instincts and idealism to dominate to the detriment of its credibility .
This vote is not at odds with my environmental concerns as co-incineration in cement works is not particularly harmful for the environment .
Likening 'partially separated waste ' to 'untreated mixed municipal waste ' , as Amendment No 14 does , risks affecting the development of the waste sorting sectors which we are trying to establish and in which some or all of the residues could be co-incinerated .
However , I believe that some countries are not prepared for this either practically or theoretically .
Davies report ( A5-0062/2000 )
This is to be regretted .
The programmes are to be updated and revised by 2006 .
Without compulsory deadlines , texts are all too often simply declarations of intent which achieve nothing .
Unemployment and the resulting poverty and social exclusion are scourges which we must tackle head-on .
Fraternity is one of these ideals and together , ladies and gentlemen , we can achieve it .
Moreover , the supposedly reassuring
