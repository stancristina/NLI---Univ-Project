Following more than three years ' work on the Community Code on Visas and complicated negotiations with the Council , it has finally proved possible to reach a compromise .
Germany , in particular , has already gone far beyond previous stipulations from Brussels .
Transparency is vital to the functioning of a market .
However , there is something , Mr President , that I do not understand .
We need a European model .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the decision we have taken is a smart one and it has been cleverly presented .
That - as so often in the European Union - is partly down to funding , and in particular to the lack of funding in Member States which still have the unfortunate habit of demanding a lot of support from the European Union .
I also believe that , as has already been said , we have made clear where the aspects worthy of criticism lie , namely in group supervision .
Together with the Solvency II negotiating team , we have refused to be intimidated by any particular sources of pressure , and instead have steered a clear course in the interests of consumers , of the insurance industry and , above all , of course , of our parliamentary duties .
We would have done better to define clear principles and leave responsibility for implementing and developing these principles with the undertakings themselves .
Since this could pose problems for some banks or insurance companies , we advocate that this capital increase take the form of government holdings entailing corresponding influence on company policy .

Green Paper on the future of TEN-T policy ( Voting time Mobile phones are now part of everyday life , and large sections of the population never go anywhere without them .
If you can tell us what is happening with the Council 's off-budget accounts , then please go ahead .
I shall not go into all of them today , but I should like to highlight one result of the unofficial trialogue that is very important to me , namely the combating of 'letterbox companies ' .
I hope that the Commission will make a clear statement today on the further opening of cabotage markets and on Article 306 .
The other thing I want to say here concerns cabotage itself .
If we bear in mind that shipping services are provided not only by colossal undertakings but also , particularly in the case of ferry operators , by small and medium-sized enterprises , we must take a reasonable approach to compensation .
My second point is that we should include as much as possible when it comes to bus and coach transport .
That is why we transport politicians are urgently interested in a solution , because our stated target , namely that Marco Polo should help to displace 60 % of the increase in road freight traffic , is now a long way away .
The eligibility thresholds for the proposed projects are to be lowered in comparison with Marco Polo I and are equal to utilisation by small and medium-sized enterprises .
I look forward to the fundamental debate which we shall have shortly on the third programme , on the basis of a communication which the Commission has promised , so that we can discuss all the fundamental questions , everything that we have listed in a joint motion for a compromise , such as whether we should split up the programme for individual modes of transport and so on .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I too thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation .
That is what this legislation lays down , and for that reason we welcome it unreservedly .
The fact that we are able to improve this situation through the advent of reference networks is a great achievement .
The Commission 's initiative , Commissioner , is also very important .
For that reason we must reject this amendment .
Only the entire state of Bosnia and Herzegovina can accede to the European Union .
This must not be repeated next year .
East and West participated in this programme .
To close , I should like to thank the international organisations such as Mayors for Peace , the IPPNW and the ICAN.
Only 15 % of disabled children are integrated into the school system .
The new proposal was necessary , because a few shortcomings emerged in the application of the 2002 regulation which led to problems in practice .
We will have to examine whether the setting of the end point by the European Commission complies with the aforementioned criterion , namely legal certainty .
It is permitted to use certain Category 1 material in pet food .
However , that would result in a change to the quality of the fertiliser and I believe that we have formulated a good regulation in this regard and that our small-scale gardeners who like organic fertilisers so much can also be appropriately provided for .
However , we must do this in a way that involves the Afghans and that respects their dignity , and as a top priority this of course includes - whether some people like it or not - the dignity of women .
The translation may give rise to confusion in the different languages .
At the same time , it was also rejected by the Permanent Representatives Committee which was meeting in the neighbouring room .
In this case we could not even agree on this principle being laid down in a recital .
For example , it would have been possible to put in place a European on-call time regulation which specified for the whole of Europe that 'on-call time is working time ' , as the Court
