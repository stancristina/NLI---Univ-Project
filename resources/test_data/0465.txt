While the former case involves fraudulence , the latter is , it is hoped , just a momentary , temporary difficulty .
We are thus increasingly sure that the review of this directive , until now expected for 2002 , will be brought forward to the beginning of next year , without waiting for too many months to go by .
Imagine what can come into houses through a dish in the remotest parts of the world .
I refer first of all to the need to face the slow-down in economic growth by means of coordination of our economic and social policies , countering the economic cycle .
I am also grateful to the other speakers in this sitting - Messrs Konrad and Berenguer Fuster and Ms Riis-Jørgensen - for their political and , I must add , their cultural support for the European Union ' s competition policy .
Considerable progress has been made towards a reform of the competition rules , to which Parliament gave decisive support a month ago , adopting Mr Evans ' s report by such a large majority .
On the issue of mergers , a communication on corrective provisions has been adopted , as has a simplified procedure for certain straightforward types of operation , so that now about 40 per cent of merger cases can be dealt with in this way .
The first and most important is the impact of competition policy on consumers .
After Lisbon , Paris and Stockholm , the next will be held under the Belgian Presidency in Antwerp on 11 October , and will focus on competition in the pharmaceutical sector .
Within the year we intend to conclude the revision of the de minimis communication , which , by specifying which agreements between companies are not forbidden under Article 81 , Paragraph 1 , will reduce the burden on companies , especially smaller ones , of conforming to the rules .
The practical stage will be to give the necessary indications .
First of all , I would ask you to check and find out whether the President received this letter .
In the debate , Mr Tajani did the same , refuting these arguments with arguments of his own .
The agencies are not the source of the information , but rather the text of the letter that I sent to Mrs Fontaine to ask her if she thought it appropriate to intervene following certain statements made in this House by the President of the Socialist Group , Mr Barón Crespo and other members of the same Group .
My concern is not the delay in reaching the position that is emerging today in the report , but rather that more specific detail should be given regarding interventions , the form these take , controls and the procedures by which they are enforced , and the flexibility and dignity of the controls - in other words they should not be humiliating for the producer or the consumer .
Thirty per cent of the world ' s population live in conditions of extreme poverty , a situation exacerbated by continuous population growth and the inadequacy - or , rather , the decline - of policies for development aid , assistance and cooperation .
The reports concentrate on the fight against AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis , going at length into sophisticated technical analyses and proposals for reforms , which may serve to improve our measures for combating poverty - especially on the question of drugs and health services - but do not propose any measures to improve the effectiveness of policies on population control , healthy and sustainable fertility , or free and informed maternity , as if this subject had disappeared from our view .
This trend seems today to be more contained , not because population policies have been successful but because of epidemics , especially , as has been said , of AIDS , TB and malaria .
It would be unfair if any of the three had to wait until the others caught up in the democratisation process .
In this context it would , of course , also be necessary to analyse what the West and the major countries have done in such regions and to analyse , for instance , whether the ethnic revolts in Georgia are local or led from outside , and if so by whom .
Madam President , there is an urgent matter missing from the agenda to which I would briefly like to draw the attention of the Presidency and the Members .
These are all people who are over 75 years of age , and therefore pensioners , who have been left by the Italian government without a pension .
As regards responsibility , I feel that we , as the European Union , should call upon the Commission and the Council to be more rigorous in enforcing the imperative need for airport security , to ensure that such tragedies are avoided in future .
Among the errors which may have already been made , consider the case of the US citizen arrested in Belgium because he had lost his passport whom SIS recorded as a passport thief .
As has already been said , the importance of providing greater incentives for public participation has already been recognised at international level , with the Aarhus Convention .
It too must allow for a healthy subsidiarity , for customs , for habits , and for the level of directly democratic involvement possible in the various countries .
Only in June 2001 did the Council adopt a common position .
Precisely because this directive introduces minimum standard rights , it must be enforced for all European employees simultaneously .
I refer , in particular , to the legislation on European works councils , which has not been transposed by all the Member States and
