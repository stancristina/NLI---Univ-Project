nightmare prospect of human cloning must be banned well in time , because it would create insuperable problems in our societies .
In-vitro fertilization as a way of producing children was also deplored , and world-wide public opinion still regards euthanasia with mistrust .
The European Parliament 's duty is to determine the fine line which defines what is ethically acceptable and socially permissible and beneficial .
Mr President , we spend a lot of time talking about the Alps and other mountain regions , and there is a risk that we could fall into the self-deception of thinking that there are no problems in the plains , that everything there is getting on fine .
We all know that they share certain common characteristics : despite their variety and individuality , mountain regions have natural disadvantages caused by their climates and the composition of their soil .
The result will be to destroy those roots of historical and cultural traditions .
As a supplement to what we have already heard from the other speakers , which I accept and subscribe to , I in my turn would like to ask you whether the European Commission has considered how it is going to deal with two additional problems which will probably arise in the future .
I would like you to tell me whether you have reconsidered the matter and how you propose to deal with it .
I would like to ask him to tell me something else since we are talking about South-East Asia , if I may .
Is that currently the subject of any discussion by the European Commission ?
I am against deferment , because the reasons given by those who are calling for it do not hold up in any way .
The same has happened this year with our esteemed colleague Mrs Astrid Thors .
And Mrs Thors has formulated practical proposals to deal with several problems , with which - naturally - I think most of us can agree .
There are several other positive elements , Mr President , during the period we are considering .
The teaching of Community Law has not yet even become established in the law schools of the top Educational Institutions in the 15 Member States .
Madam President , on behalf of the European People 's Party I must stress that we too support the common position , as amended by the Committee on Transport 's three amendments , which we already approved in committee .
This new amending directive certainly represents great progress .
We make progress with safety issues , we extend the controls applied to ships in European ports and in terms of the ability of the crews that man the ships , any ships , and steer them into European ports , but we have still done nothing to propose positive measures to stop shipping from abandoning European flags .
I should like to say , however , that it is time for , and we are waiting to see , a new spirit , a new approach to the issue of positive measures on behalf of shipping , because we continue to progress haphazardly either via second ships ' registers , and now every country is setting up a second ships ' register , or by continually running down the European flags to the benefit of other , improbable flags , and I stress this point .
Madam President , I too think that the report by Mr Parodi contributes greatly towards improving the Council Directive amending Directive 94/58/EEC , and our group supports it .
I could accept Mr Parodi 's argument if , under the heading of human error , we included neglect , criminal neglect and the criminal cover-ups often associated with the operation of such vessels .
The three amendments insisted upon by Mr Parodi have our support , in relation both to medical fitness and to watch-keeping conditions on the bridge , as well as the subject of restricted rest periods .
We feel obliged to make that statement because the report does not just relate to tourism as its title suggests , but more generally to the issue of the essential transparency and prudent operation of the Commission 's services .
Because of those procedures , the furtherance of penal and disciplinary matters has been and is being delayed and claims are being set aside .
How can we recommend to the House that it should or should not grant the Commission discharge if the Commission itself does not provide us with facts and figures ?
Other speakers too have mentioned the issue .
I ask for a number of corrections , especially in Articles 4 and 2.
Both my group and I will be supporting this report , in other words we will vote for the motion on the need to grant a new loan to Ukraine , since the new loan has two objectives : firstly , to assist the country 's economic development and secondly , to foster political stability there , which is a very important factor .
These two objectives are contributions towards improving the quality of life for the people who live there .
The Commission , the responsible Commissioner Mr Van Den Broek , told me , very diplomatically of course but very clearly , that there were suspicions that the money was not spent for that purpose at all .
I believe that whether we call it sabotage or just delay , this matter has at any rate taken a number of years to progress from first reading to the second reading here today .
The question is , how well do the specific articles realize the intention ?
They represent a first step , and I believe that we are not just taking a first step but we are making tangible progress in relation to the situations and views that prevailed four years ago .
