At Kyoto , for example , Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott secured , against the odds , an agreement to cut global emissions .
Britain is already well on the way to achieving its target of cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 20 % by 2010 .
Not content with that , the Government has recently raised the target to 60-70 % by 2050 .
This House should challenge other Member States to match Britain 's example .
They will get their chance to pick up the gauntlet at the forthcoming Kyoto follow-up Conference in The Hague this November .
Of course , protecting the planet means much more than just cleaning up the atmosphere .
It means protecting the natural environment on the ground too .
Again , Britain 's Labour Government is leading the way .
Its recent Wildlife Bill , for example , will give greater protection to endangered species than ever before .
Furthermore , 'right to roam ' legislation will give the British public the freedom to enjoy and appreciate our beautiful countryside .
Madam President , coherent action is urgently required at local , national and European levels to clean up our land , sea and air .
The Euro-Flower is just one element of the broader environmental strategy that is needed to save our planet .
Our citizens want to see concrete action .
They do not want to see mere hot air from politicians , which just adds to global warming .
By harnessing Euro-Flower power , we can all contribute to a cleaner , greener world .
Recommendation for second reading of the Blokland report ( A5-0056/2000 )
- The European Union has been at the forefront in devising new waste management strategies in recent years .
In fact , the object of the directive we are discussing here today is to reduce the adverse effects of incineration on the environment and on human health by considerably reducing the emission levels of several major pollutants into the air .
This directive also seeks to control the discharge of waste into our water systems .
This report is now before us at second reading .
I note that one of the recommendations from the European Council is that , if an operator of a plant incinerating non-hazardous waste intends to start incinerating hazardous waste , an integrated pollution prevention and control licence must be secured .
I believe that this is a particularly sensible proposal .
It is very important that the European Union is very active in putting in place new waste management proposals .
Waste in Europe has been generated at a rate of over 1kg per person per day . 2 billion tonnes of waste are being generated within the EU each year .
The European Union is clear about one aspect of our waste disposal problem .
The future of waste disposal does not lie in local authorities up and down the length and breadth of this country searching for new landfill sites .
There is a growing concern about the environmental consequences of landfill sites in general .
Nothing less than a major shift from reliance on landfill sites to more integrated waste management plans will suffice .
The European Union fully supports the strict , ambitious but attainable recycling and recovery targets that have been laid down by the Irish Government .
These targets , which are to be achieved over the next fifteen years , include the following : · A diversion of 50 % of overall household waste from landfill sites . · A minimum 65 % reduction in bio-degradable waste presently consigned for landfill sites . · The development of waste recovery facilities , employing environmentally beneficial technologies capable of treating up to 300 000 tonnes of bio-degradable waste per annum .
All these measures reflect changing public opinions on the issue of waste management .
The day of landfill sites is now coming to an end and they must be replaced by more environmentally beneficial technologies .
There is unanimous support for this position across all the fifteen Member States of the European Union .
- I find it incredible , given the anti-Brussels hysteria of his UKIP allies , that Mr Blokland has managed to produce such an over-regulated monster of a report .
But at least these proposals will allow the anti-European rubbish peddled by Mr Blokland and the UKIP to be disposed of in an environmentally-friendly manner .
The aim of these proposals is to improve air quality and protect human health .
Incineration is often the most effective and safe method of waste disposal .
Sometimes , however , it can release dangerous chemicals , such as dioxins , into the atmosphere .
It is therefore vital that these by-products are monitored and prevented from escaping into the environment .
The technology for cleaning up fumes from waste incineration plants already exists .
We just need to make sure that it is used .
The sensible measures put forward by the Commission should encourage the utilisation of this technology .
I find the UKIP 's hypocrisy breathtaking .
I challenge the UKIP to explain to their own supporters how they can be allied to such an obvious supporter of EU over-regulation .
While pretending to be the Eurocrat 's foe , they are clearly , in fact , the Eurocrat 's friend .
I fear that cleaning up the environment may prove to be a doddle compared to the task of persuading the UKIP to clean up its act .
The losers , sadly , will be our own citizens .
Madam President , I congratulate the four rapporteurs on their work , and in particular Baroness Ludford for carrying forward work that I , amongst others , helped to initiate nearly a decade and a half ago with the first Committee of Inquiry into Racism and Fascism in Europe , whose rapporteur , in fact , was an excellent member of the Christian Democrat Group and of Nea Dimokratia
