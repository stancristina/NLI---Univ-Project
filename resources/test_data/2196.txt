Therefore , let us get to grips with social inequality before this entire matter is pushed too far into the future .
Today Commissioner Verheugen said that to live in Europe is to live with compromises .
Therefore I was unhappy when I learnt that the European Parliament rapporteur on Slovakia had accused the Hungarian minority parties of setting ultimatums and using methods that are used only in wartime when they made their future in the government dependent on an administrative reform .
That is what we are asking for in Resolution No 39 .
Mr President , the Commission is aware of the matters for concern which have been raised by the honourable Member .
In order to discuss these questions the Commission issued a communication , on 11 July 2001 on the protection of pedestrians .
Each year , 9 000 pedestrians and cyclists are killed , and 200 000 are injured , in accidents involving a motor vehicle .
As to how regulation is to be implemented , there is a choice between , on the one hand , a voluntary agreement of the industry based on agreed objectives and , on the other hand , the conventional legislative route .
According to the agreement , the car manufacturers promise to ensure that all new passenger cars will go through a series of tests with the purpose of ensuring that the cars are designed in such a way that pedestrians and cyclists who are involved in an accident will suffer as little injury as possible .
It is estimated that the annual number of deaths would be cut by two thousand if all motor vehicles on the roads of the European Union met the requirements of the EEVC tests .
This reduction would represent 20 percent of the present level .
If the Commission decides to propose legislation , this would be based on the content of the commitment .
In the next stage , the manufacturers will commit to installing other safety equipment .
From 2003 onwards , all new vehicles would be fitted with anti-blocking brakes .
Negotiations concerning similar commitments are underway with the South Korean car manufacturers , which would lead to almost one hundred percent coverage .
As the honourable Member is aware , the Commission has sent the commitment which was approved in July to the European Parliament and Council for comment .
Mr President , I wish to thank the Commissioner for his thorough response .
Is the reply of the Commissioner to be interpreted as meaning that , at some stage , the idea will come to predominate within the Commission that the quickest results can be obtained by making an agreement with the car manufacturers , in other words that the preferred line of action will be to follow this procedure rather than enacting a Directive on the matter ?
Both alternatives have their good points .
The legislative route is more traditional and familiar , but will be more time-consuming ; however the Commission wishes to make this decision now that the reporting round is complete .
Wiretapping and spying are an intolerable invasion of people ' s privacy and are in direct contravention of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights .
It even feels as if a sort of bellicose mood somehow lingers in the United States of America .
What is actually happening over there ?
I think we must now establish a watertight agreement at charter level that we do not engage in industrial espionage amongst one another , and our most important trading partner and friend , the United States , must be persuaded to adhere to this principle .
At the same time we must ensure that we are able to check that nobody is violating the privacy of European Union citizens .
We have important work to do in this area .
At the same time I wish to say that I voted in error in favour of Amendment No 4 , which was tabled for Mrs Carlsson ' s report , as in fact I opposed this amendment , which I consider to be of dubious value with regard to the area ' s stability .
Madam President , Mr Fatuzzo is not alone here , which is nice for him .
It is not our task to advise independent countries on how they are to manage their affairs regarding energy , and our own credibility suffers if we discuss the issue of nuclear power time and time again in a populist manner that ignores the facts .
Numerous international study trips have been made to Temelin , for example , and it meets all the international criteria .
Romania , on the other hand , has coal-fired power stations that are 40 years old - they are nearly as old as me - so it is only reasonable for them to build the modern Canadian nuclear plant there .
With regard to Mr Schr√∂der ' s report I wish to say that hazardous nuclear power stations are not the internal problem of just one country .
Wiersma report ( A5-0256/2001 )
Regulation 1017 has been applied with only little modification since the 1960s .
It is therefore understandable that the continued application of this regulation in its current form is no longer consistent with effective supervision of competition .
In my view , in a period of 30 years of implementation , EC competition law has reached a level where decentralising is not only possible , but almost necessary .
In that question , I totally disagree with Mr Titford .
Ex ante notification should not be replaced with a burdensome registration system .
There are many detailed situations where legal certainty might be a danger .
Personally I , and many of my colleagues from smaller Member States , are worried about the definitions of dominant position in the market .
The Commission decision to say no to the Volvo/Scania merger was an example of
