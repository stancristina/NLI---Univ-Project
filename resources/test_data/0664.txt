We hope that , in the work of the Intergovernmental Conference , ministers will take account of these considerations and be forthright in drawing attention to them .
The European Commission , however , is not listening : instead of abandoning its unsuccessful attempts to harmonise VAT and allowing the Member States to regain their freedom , it wants , on the contrary , to increase its powers by forcing derogations to be quickly done away with .
So , either these votes , which really are extremely important and require a qualified majority , are indeed transferred to Wednesday , or they take place on Thursday , but right at the beginning of the sitting , so that we do in fact have the quorum needed .     Mr President , at a time when I believe that we will all be very concerned about mobility because of the New Year celebrations , I would like to report to you and also to the Italian Presidency an extremely distinctive situation that affects Italian residents in Belgium .
Just after the acceptance of the French plan was achieved in the Commission  – and I would say after a long brave struggle – Alstom decided to quite simply close one of its companies in my region , to relocate it to Montrouge , near Paris .
To conclude , Mr President , I welcome the fact that , as regards this issue , which , as we can see , is complex and sensitive , the European law that we are in the process of drawing up in this House establishes first and foremost general principles and rules , which must be flexible and progressive in the interests of putting patients first .
I particularly welcome the removal of two amendments : 35 , which related to abortion , and 38 , which did not distinguish between therapeutic cloning and reproductive cloning .
The Pechiney , Crédit Lyonnais and Vivendi Universal affairs , show this all to well .     The report deals only with those distortions of competition that are liable to be detrimental to the private enterprises that are taking over the postal sector ; in no way does it reflect the interests either of users or of postal workers .
I know that we are now at second reading and I have learnt to be realistic after several years as a Member of this Parliament .
These are factors that I ask my fellow Members to take into consideration when talking about nuclear power .
I must remind you that when the directive of 20 November 2001 was drawn up as regards safety of buses and coaches , this issue had already been the subject of a debate .
Finally , this impasse is giving new life to the outdated old ideas of the hard core .
That is what happens , Mr Prodi , when Penelope goes against the teaching of the Odyssey and unravels instead of knitting .
Let us rather take the opportunity that is given to us of laying the foundations of a new Europe , one which has rediscovered its natural borders .
Before now , we did not have the right to frame the question in those terms .
After all , it is an ill wind and it will give the campaign added interest .
If the European institutions were concerned about the interests of the majority of the public then they would standardise VAT by proposing to abolish it , which would simplify the procedure at the same time .
Let us hope that this provisional compromise will become the norm : it in fact foreshadows a more pragmatic and less standardising view of the European market , which in our view is the right one .
For over a century , the European states have established public postal services that worked in more or less acceptable fashion until criteria of public service began to give way to those of profitability .
A trouble-free budget , then , but one marked by a general reduction in Parliament’s powers on financial matters .
All of this requires a coherent , ambitious information and communication policy and without Parliament’s intervention , funds set aside for this policy would have been subject to budget cuts from the Council .
Given the threats , recrimination and pettiness that have dogged us , is it any wonder that we had misgivings when voting on this budget ?
Funds from Heading 4 allocated to foreign aid have been reduced to a bare minimum : aid to Latin America has also been cut by EUR 35 million .
As a member of the Council of Europe , Georgia has the right to join the EU , as do the Balkan countries , whose right to do so has recently been recognized .
In fact , analysis has shown that generic medicines on the one hand and innovations by pharmaceutical laboratories on the other are not contradictory .
The review of pharmaceutical legislation does not seek solely to strike an optimum balance between generics and innovation .
On the basis of this meeting and in the light of rulings already handed down by the Court of Justice of the European Communities , a joint and official interpretative statement could then be published .
It would have been easy to ignore the subject , but we have not done so .
All of the provisions that I have mentioned so far also apply to all veterinary medicinal products .
I was also delighted with Commissioner Liikanen’s response to Mrs Grossetête’s question about so-called ‘borderline ’ products , whose status does require further clarification .
Over and above introducing Braille , we have improved pharmacovigilance and transparency in patients ’ interests , but it is true that some last-minute Council compromises subtly weakened these gains .
It is true that the major cause of friction related to the authorisation of
