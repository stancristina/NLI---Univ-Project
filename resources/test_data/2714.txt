We need to support this effort .
I hope , on the basis of what the Commissioner said to us earlier , that the relevant position of the European Union is constant , so that when Cyprus becomes a member of the European Union and the Cypriot question has been resolved , which we hope it will , the can be applied 100 % to all policies in the whole of reunited Cyprus .     .
In particular , I should like to express the satisfaction of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market at the fact that these countries are aligning with the in the fields of company law , accounting rules , customs law and movements of capital and , more generally , at the noteworthy results achieved as a whole in the field of transposing legislation into their national law .
Our committee expresses satisfaction at the progress made by Bulgaria in most of the individual sectors of transport and calls for enforcement of the to the road , railway and aviation sectors .
It calls further for the strengthening of coordination and cooperation between ministries , as well as with relevant agencies and other stakeholders .
Consequently , proper operation of the market presupposes acceptance of this basic political objective .
Only thus will it be possible for the European model to be exported and to play a leading role in the global market .
The second concern is to address the phenomena of the development of the internal market by just one section of the companies and the active population .
However , the Commission programme on trans-European networks does not respond to the real need for development for the benefit of the workers and grass roots , to the need to improve their standard of living or to the need for easier communication between peoples .
We are opposed to any participation by private capital , especially the exploitation of works by private capital .
We believe that the workers must claim public-sector infrastructure works , define their priorities and demand wholly public investments with Community participation .     .
The Commission ’s proposals as a whole and for each country are revelatory .
However , there is also the other pole , the workers ’ and grass-roots movement in general , which has the power , by rallying and fighting , to ruin these plans .     . – Once again Parliament has turned its attention to the progress of the candidate countries .
The report is brimming with hypocrisy as far as human rights are concerned .
We are certain that the Cypriot people will fight for a fair and viable solution .     .
The Miller report welcomes the Commission ’s proposals for the privatisation of public utilities .
In other words , nothing will be left standing in the name of the profit of big business and the multinationals .
They even went as far as organising a coup d’état in order to oust President Chavez and his government , but they failed thanks to the decisive intervention of the people of Venezuela themselves .
The time when the imperialists imposed dictatorships everywhere has passed .
Luz Perly Córdoba , a trade unionist from the agricultural movement Campesina de Arauca , was arrested on 18 February and the communist Marίa Lucero Henao was murdered , together with her husband , by soldiers on 6 February .
This turns Greece , as numerous sides have denounced , into a magnet for terrorist counterattacks .
Interpreting the pacifist and anti-imperialist feelings of the Greek people , we condemn this situation and call on all those in the House who continue to take even a rudimentary interest in democracy to call for NATO not to interfere in the Olympic Games .     Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , both the directive on the harmonisation of transparency requirements and the directive on financial services bring us today to the end of a difficult procedure , which required an immense effort as far as financial services are concerned , especially on the part of the rapporteur , Mrs Villiers .
The purpose of the directive on investment services , about which , as shadow rapporteur , I should like to say more , is to revive the European passport for businesses in the financial sector .
This issue is one of the most thorny and complicated we have to address , because we face new phenomena on the market here , with entire stock exchanges being converted to private companies and entire private companies operating as sort of mini-stock exchanges and clearing huge numbers of transactions .
We have reached a compromise on this very difficult issue which , like all compromises , is not to everyone’s absolute satisfaction , but it was necessary in order for us to move forward .
The Group of the Party of European Socialists supports the agreement reached with the Council on the directive on investment services and , of course , it also supports the report on the harmonisation of transparency requirements for financial services .     . – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , may I start by thanking you for your kind words and welcome .
The report by Mr Pérez Álvarez was perfect and I must also thank him on behalf of the Commission because , on such a difficult technical issue as that in the proposal on physical agents , especially electromagnetic fields , he spoke so well and his report was truly exceptional .
The social agenda emphasised this issue , which was confirmed in the Commission communication on a new strategy for health and safety in the workplace .
It should be noted that it was not yet possible to examine the carcinogenic effect of electromagnetic fields , due to a lack of adequate scientific data or indication of a link of cause and effect between electromagnetic fields and cancer
