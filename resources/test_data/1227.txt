Hardly anywhere else does such a huge difference exist as is the case on the eastern border of our country .
The reason is obvious if you think about it for a moment .
That is what happened over there , and we will not get carried away in the flood , whatever you tell us .
That makes for a pretty powerful brew .
Besides , who will be bothered by this restriction on imports from the east ?
What sort of experience have you had in this regard ?
Because we do have experience of it .
There is research data on that .
What happened ?
And we still have an additional problem .
Then we would be obligated to lower taxation in our own country with a consequent decrease in tax revenue , but in either case the consumption of alcohol will increase .
In other words , there is quite a significant double-edged problem .
Excise duty on beer is very high in our country but , ladies and gentlemen , what we cannot eliminate is the price gap that exists between us and our neighbour to the east .
And if it is removed , I will just say that our roads to the east will be soaked in vodka if all import restrictions are lifted .
Madam President , Finland has had a period of transition to adapt regulations for imports of alcohol to EU levels .
The European Court of Justice and the Commission accept this order of priorities , and I thus hope for understanding on the part of Parliament as well .
In my opinion , the picture created in Mrs Lulling ' s report of the situation in Finland is a false one .
The essential problem regarding imports from non-member countries is that an EU-wide restriction on imports has been imposed on strong alcoholic beverages and wines among products liable to excise duty , but , for some reason or other , there is no such restriction on beer .
That is double what a citizen of the EU can bring in from another EU country .
I would point out that no other EU country faces such a wide price differential on its borders as Finland - and the problems resulting from this price differential will not be resolved at any level of excise duty .
Knowing the high social costs of alcohol-related problems , the harmonisation of excise duty should preferably come about at the average rate for Europe , not its lowest .
Excise duty is not fiscal in nature , simply a policy to provide revenue for the state , but clearly it is an instrument which will lead to healthier lifestyles , aided by a market economy .
Mr President , my Group has also been involved in submitting this motion to the Commission , simply on the basis that we are creating a Europe that is undergoing integration , but it is not at all clear that our citizens will be able to have a say in this merging Europe and keep pace with the advance of integration .
They are , in any case , already active today .
It is , for example , very important that accurate information is available concerning their sources of income , and the financing of elections is of particular importance in this respect , since money must not determine success in elections .
The time perhaps has come to specify that only European parties such as these may enjoy public support .
If the legal basis is vague , we agree with the request for the Commission to take an initiative to make it clearer , and the Intergovernmental Conference must also take responsibility for this .
- I voted in favour of lifting the ban on sales of oral tobacco , so called snuff , in the EU.
I also want the different restrictions to be based on scientific facts .
Unfortunately my proposal was not adopted .
The rapporteur , Mrs Lulling , strongly criticised the taxation of alcohol in Finland in her report , which she considers to be unreasonably high .
She also criticised the aim to restrict the importation of beer through derogation provisions .
According to that proposal , Finland would reserve the right to abolish the more stringent restrictions on imports from EU countries in stages by the end of 2003 .
In my opinion , Finland is consequently justified in maintaining more stringent restrictions on imports than other EU countries .
Women' s human rights , the trade in women , violence against women , women ' s economic rights , the status of civil society : we may be pleased about the progress that has been made in all these issues .
It is the very determined work of the European Union we have to thank for that .
It was especially gratifying for me that all the Member States and almost all the candidate countries were talking together under Portugal ' s leadership .
The only exception among the candidate countries was Poland , which was not at all interested in supporting the strengthening of women ' s rights in the same way as the Member States of the European Union and the other candidate countries .
I believe this conference has given hope to all those millions of women who are without fundamental human rights ; and we need a further follow-up conference in five years ' time .
Despite the giant leaps forward , many problems remain unresolved and questions left open with regard to world trade .
One of the biggest and politically most difficult of these has been China ' s accession to the WTO , and this same problem will again be associated with the implementation of the agreement in practice .
I agree with Mr Clegg as regards the impression one gets that the Commission
