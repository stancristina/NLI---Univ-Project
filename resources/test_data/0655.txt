concerned , I should like to hear the opinion of the Dutch Presidency and of Mr Nicolaï as to what the position of the Dutch Presidency is in the run-up to the European Council .
To close ...     – Mr President , I should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur , Mr Eurlings , on his excellent work and on the spirit of cooperation which he has demonstrated throughout the procedure .
This paragraph also covers relations between Greece and Turkey .
There also needs to be a third alternative : the option of a special relationship with Turkey .
However , Turkey should not accede to the European Union while Cyprus is partitioned and occupied , without recognising the Republic of Cyprus .
With such a development , you can be sure that the Greek Cypriot Christians , who account for 82 % of the population of Cyprus , and the Turkish Cypriot Muslims , who account for 18 % , will be a perhaps unique example of peaceful coexistence , cooperation and progress and Cyprus will become a real bridge of peace and cooperation between the European Union and the Arab nations and Israel , with which Cyprus has always maintained excellent relations .     – Mr President , Mr Eurlings had a very difficult job to accomplish .
From everything set out in the report and from everything we know , it appears clear that Turkey does not meet the Copenhagen criteria .
It is something which Europe needs to address decisively and dynamically .
However , it should be made clear that Turkey , just like any country seeking membership , needs to realise that it has not only rights , but also obligations .
Finally , Turkey needs to realise that its European prospects depend , first and foremost , on Turkey itself and on the stand which it will maintain on a large number of issues .     – Mr President , the programme statements by the new Commission may not be admissible in evidence , but they were submitted .
The financing of the occupying government and cooperation with the conquerors of Iraq will be to the detriment of peace and of the Iraqi resistance , while negotiations with the WTO guarantee that new hordes will join the unemployed and small and medium-sized farm holdings will be wiped out .
The citizens of Europe expect specific policies which will create new jobs and really improve their standard of living .
It is a question of the credibility of Europe that the necessary and adequate financing be safeguarded in order to implement these policies .
Priority also needs to be given to education , training , innovation and research and technology and equal importance also needs to be attached to upgrading services and infrastructures in the regions of Europe .
These are both good reasons for adjusting the rules and disciplines of the WTO , for further opening the markets in goods and services and for forging a stronger link between international trade and development .
In order for the new globalised environment to be able to optimise the distribution of resources , stability , predictability and solidarity , it will need to be reinforced with new , strong administrative institutions and mechanisms .
I believe that this is the direction in which Europe should move and in which the Commission – I am addressing you , Mr President of the Commission – is being called on to develop creative initiatives and actions .     . – We consider it right in principle that the level of participation in programmes supporting rural development by countries which acceded to the EU on 1 May 2004 should be balanced with that of the existing Member States .
It makes employers alone responsible for the evaluation of educational and vocational qualifications , so that they can select the most 'convenient ' worker for their exploitative requirements , depriving the education system of this role .
We call for the Europass to be abolished and for the adoption of : 1 ) a single , free , state education system which will create an integrated educational foundation and fundamental vocational training which will result in full professional sufficiency and 2 ) a high standard of living and equal employment , education and living conditions for workers on the move .     .
There are monitoring and identification systems for identifying the undertakings and livestock units which may have been contaminated .
It is indeed a legal tool for taking decisions which safeguard the protection of public health .
Current Community legislation already includes such provisions .
Finally , as far as landfills are concerned , Community legislation has been adopted in order to ensure that landfills are designed and operated in a way which does not jeopardise human health or the environment .     – Madam President , Commissioner , the necessary tools for managing risks and safeguarding public health are , on the one hand , the adoption of maximum limits for dioxins in feedingstuff substances , feedingstuffs and food at strict but feasible levels which will become stricter as time goes by and , on the other hand , the apportionment of responsibility at all stages of the food chain at which dioxins are identified .
I should like to add that , as far as upper limits on dioxins are concerned , they have already been set and there are strict standards .
I raise this in the light of the civil wars which go on for years and make it impossible to get this financial and material aid to civilians , especially medical and pharmaceutical aid for young children and the elderly .     – Mr President , I should like to make three comments on the issue which we are debating .
How could this be addressed , Commissioner ?
