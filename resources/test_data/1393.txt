of full or substitute members of the main committee .
This has created a breach , if not of the Rules of Procedure , at least of their interpretation .
This seemed to be an elegant way of accepting the practice of this House , allowing other members to join the subcommittees and , in so doing , maintaining two principles : the fundamental link , but also the opportunity for greater involvement .
Reading Mrs Veil 's report , we can see how the main problems relating to the free movement of persons are caused not so much by a gap in the legislation but rather by the non-application of the directives and regulations , which are at times obsessively complex .
Mr President , I simply wish to confirm what I requested during the debate : that this regulation should come into force on 14 September , so as to give the subcommittees concerned time to adapt to these new regulations .
There is no doubt that these devastating fires are the result of commercial greed and a blinkered outlook on life .
Mr President , I will use this additional time you have granted me to welcome Commissioner Pinheiro and to welcome the decision of the Commission which , in Solomonic fashion , as we are dealing with Asia and Latin America , thought of asking the Commissioner responsible for Africa to reply .
Three Italians were arrested and one of them , Dino Frisullo , is still in jail .
This Turkish leading political and military class only understands the language of force .
It is not that the Christian club does not want an Islamic country .
Mr President , as those speaking before me said , on 21 March the Kurds celebrated their new year , the " Newroz ' , during which demonstrations took place defending the rights of the Kurdish people .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in all sincerity I believe that we are not so much discussing the problem of the Italian citizen , Dino Frisullo , as the Turkish Government and the role Turkey is playing in its relations with the EU.
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the question of Cameroon raises a more general problem : that of freedom of expression , and particularly freedom of the press , in some of the developing countries , particularly some African countries .
On 1 October last year , Mumia Abu-Jamal 's lawyers submitted an appeal for the case to be retried by the Supreme Court of the State of Pennsylvania .
I just have a few points to add .
However , we wish to make a few points .
In particular , the European Parliament , which will be consulted on the appointment of the president and other members of the board , should obtain an annual report , during a part-session , on the activities of the European Central Bank which , explaining briefly the reasons for the monetary policy currently applied and that implemented in the previous year , should give proof of the impartiality of its choices .
As the communist regime destroyed every rule of civil life during its rule , the accession to the European Union of ex-communist countries presupposes a type of revival by the applicants , to make their internal structures compatible with the rules and spirit of the European Union .
The document sets out the rules relating to the cooperation agreement between the European Commission , ESA and EUROCONTROL , and so it seems a fairly positive first step to take .
Dominant positions and restrictive market practices are also more frequent and have transnational effects .
When a party is the victim of anticompetitive behaviour within the territory of a second party , the first party can ask the second to take measures applying the second party 's anticompetition laws .
That is particularly the case because there is more information available at the European Commission than at the American competition authorities .
In fact , the emphasis of the last few days risks leading us to forget that , in displaying a great deal of energy and ability , each state will have to be able to adapt its system of development to the single currency and to forget about the need to inform both the economic sectors most involved and , on the other side , the weakest categories of the real opportunities and risks of the euro .
Mr President , I would like to concentrate on the subject of the public debt : this is an important subject as its level is directly linked to the aim of ensuring that the euro area allows the financial markets to operate well , particularly with regard to the public component .
Finally , it seems to me that , while expressing satisfaction over this historic stage for Europe , we should not forget the need to strengthen democratic control in the balance of the European institutions , by reviving the Union 's institutional reforms and policy .
At a time when the European family is faced with this fact , and there will certainly be opportunities for insisting on this point , we should not spoil this opportunity , disregarding and maintaining criticisms , doubts and uncertainties that may give rise to difficulties , in respect of one country or another .
As on all ships that have made a long voyage , a few germs have got on board , such as uncertainty and scepticism , which we are overcoming with the great medicine of hope .
This is a lot , a great deal , but it is not everything .
Italy , in particular , managed to make its fairly contrived accounts credible , thanks to a marked growth in tax revenue , brought about by increasing the tax burden to the detriment of manufacturing industries .
