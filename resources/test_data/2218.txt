another new fund , this time for environmental policy , because the environment ought precisely to be an element in the operations of the Structural Funds .
There are regions where sustainable development can be achieved only through sustainable development of the environment , for example where tourism is concerned - a field in which it is predicted that a great many new jobs will be created in the future .
It does not make sense to develop tourism services unless at the same time measures are taken to ensure that we have clean water , clean beaches and unspoilt nature .
By means of it , an effort is being made to devote attention to environmental aspects on a European scale .
The Weiler report calls for the adoption of common EU minimum objectives for social protection .
We are afraid that the minimum could easily turn into a maximum .
It is therefore important to ensure that common minima can always be exceeded if a decision in favour of this is taken at national level .
The Social Protocol should become part of the Treaty , and it should be possible to take decisions on its application by a qualified majority .
This applies both to society and to enterprises .
Cuts in social protection necessitate many times greater expenditure on prisons and the maintenance of strong police forces .
Mr President , the report by the Committee of Inquiry gives a clear picture of the major problems underlying the BSE crisis , the events which led to the problem and its causes .
I should like to thank the Committee for this .
To restore that confidence will be the Commission 's principal task in dealing with the crisis from now on .
Under the Treaty , the Commission is responsible for monitoring compliance with Community legislation in the Member States .
At the various stages of food production in the Union , the BSE crisis has already cost more than ECU 2 billion .
I support the conditional vote of no confidence to compel the Commission to take those unavoidable decisions to enable it to monitor Member States ' compliance with Community legislation .
The effectiveness of the common market is at stake here .
If necessary , the Commission should introduce heavy , conditionally suspended fines for breaches of Community legislation wherever there is a danger to human health .
It revealed the tangled web in which all concerned are involved in one way or another .
The investigating bodies set up by the Commission with an advisory and monitoring remit later turned out to be very one-sided , and their scientific competence has also been called into question by Parliament 's Committee of Inquiry .
Now it is necessary to carry out quickly the measures which Parliament 's Committee of Inquiry has recommended .
The present Commission should be judged above all in the light of the seriousness with which it bears the responsibility now conferred on it and how quickly and effectively it acts upon the Committee of Inquiry 's proposals for improving administration and monitoring .
Mad cow disease must be eliminated and at the same time measures must be taken to ensure that nothing similar can happen in the future .
Decisions which have been taken must be adhered to , and it must be possible to check effectively enough that they are watertight .
It has already been said repeatedly here what is basically at stake : an agricultural policy in which it is imagined that nature can even be altered so as to turn ruminants into carnivores .
Consumers demand animal products which are safe and unproblematic from the point of view of health , and they also insist on an assurance that the conditions in which animals are reared and transported ensure a satisfactory standard of animal welfare .
The Community particularly needs to make progress with regard to animal transport in the EU , so much negative publicity has there been on this subject .
A compulsory marking system will be more effective than a voluntary one .
I would therefore ask whether it would not be sensible to introduce animal passports only for animals which move from one country to another .
After all , the production structure differs from country to country , and it ought to be possible to take this into account .
The basic principle absolutely must always be that agreements entered into must not endanger the health of consumers or animals .
A third country 's legislation should be considered equivalent only if the level of safety for which it provides is at least as high as that conferred by the EU 's own legislation .
I hope that the BSE crisis has at least taught the Commission that , even in the business world , a high standard of ethics and morality , which is above bribery , should be adhered to .
Madam President , BSE is a serious European problem .
An animal and plant disease unit is being set up in Dublin , individual marking of cattle is being improved , and databases are being established .
For example , the cattle marking system amounts to an enormous population book-keeping exercise ; it relates to millions of individuals , which , moreover , are replaced rapidly .
It is intended to enter in centralized files , inter alia , particulars of a cow 's mother , sex , all pastures where it has spent any time , and date of slaughter .
On the other hand , is the focus of the monitoring right ?
Making it possible to trace beef is purely a retrospective monitoring measure , and will not remedy serious damage after the event .
I likewise wish Commissioner Bonino every success when she sets about coordinating food safety at the Commission .
Paragraph 19 refers to an EMU information campaign conducted by Parliament and the Commission .
