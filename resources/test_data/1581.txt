we are making to provide Parliament with constant information is recognized .
But the enlargement must take place with all the guarantees that are needed to meet such a challenge ; and I am extremely worried by the fact that not all of these guarantees seem to be there .
The issue at the Luxembourg European Council was not employment but unemployment .
Mr President , I would like to conclude by saying that I appreciate the emphasis the rapporteur places on Turkey and hence Cyprus .
There are criminal codes and the law on criminal procedure to be rewritten , there are minorities to be better protected , there is the problem linked to the acquisition of Latvian nationality by the Russian-speaking minority , there are many "non-citizens ' , there is a so-called "windows system ' which does not work .
For these reasons , we , as the European Parliament , have a great political responsibility .
It has a positive budget position and is doing its utmost to bring the other macro-economic criteria under control .
Why , in a process of union willed and sought by us , ourselves become the cause of new and indeed dangerous divisions ?
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , in July the Commission presented the substance of two grand scenarios to us : one restricting the number of countries making up the first enlargement train to six , and the other setting the 1.27 % limit , that is to that maximum which must already be in force for the fifteen Member States to ensure that cohesion , the possibility of making the internal market practicable , positive and useful , without accentuating differences which have barely been flagged up , and which by some a miracle should apply to an enlargement to eighteen , twenty or twenty-five countries .
Are you sure that this midstream change of horses does not make it necessary to review the blueprint on this point ?
Mr President , Mr Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I want to express my appreciation of the reports under discussion , in particular that presented by Mr Colom i Naval , on behalf of the Committee on Budgets , inasmuch as it frankly faces up to what I consider the main problems .
I am convinced that the start of monetary union will revive the process of development and growth , much decelerated today , and this could lead to revision of the financial perspectives at the mid-term assessment rightly called for in the report we are debating .
Mr President , I am not going to talk about Padanian independence or other such grandiose issues .
I substantially agree with its premises and the criticisms of the Agenda 2000 document presented by the Commission .
As already emphasized in Agenda 2000 , the Commission is espousing a principle , a procedure , which is the opposite of what has happened in the past .
I also agree with the rapporteur that given the many relevant uncertainty factors involved in the seven-year period for the financial perspectives , it is right to envisage the possibility of a financial re-examination by including a revision clause .
The report does not take account in the slightest of the cries of alarm from businessmen , for whom a 35-hour week would mean greater costs , lower productivity , a freeze on investments , a threat to the survival of weaker companies and , ultimately , the danger of job losses .
Supporting this , as the Committee on Civil Liberties does and as the programme drawn up by Commissioner Gradin also does , certainly does not mean neglecting the victims , but only means curbing crime , taking serious preventive and repressive measures that will then justify the other assistance we want to give the victims .
Rather , it has shown that it is the delays in the asylum procedure which allow many criminals to exploit women in for the purpose of prostitution .
The idea of reducing the payment allocations below the level of the first reading was therefore rightly accepted .
Finally , I think we should quickly remember the enlargement .
We have emphasized the priorities that have always been defined - the role of the small and medium-sized businesses , the role of training , the role of the parties in providing opportunities in employment policies - and that correspond exactly with the guidelines by which the individual Member States have undertaken to draw up their plans on employment .
It is on these two words - freedom and safety - that the future of Europe depends : the freedom of the citizens , freedom of movement , which obviously cannot be called into question by the very important and increasingly difficult fight against Mafia gangs and crimes of all kinds .
What we want to emphasize , however , is that , because the future financial prospects are uncertain , we also need to review the overall financing in the light of the new financial prospects ; not only , but , in particular , when the new member countries join , the overall maximum amount will have to be reviewed , because we think this proposal is only adequate for the 15 member countries .
If we get lost in a maze , Parliament can be sure of failure .
I think we are submitting a good text to Parliament 's vote and we hope that the Commission and Council can take it into account .
I also hope that this Chamber will wish to correct any defects and approve the necessary inclusions , and here I am referring in particular to the aspect of social and economic research .
Mr President , everyone is aware that the fifth framework programme is the foundation of the research policy of the Union for years to come .
