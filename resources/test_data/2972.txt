In other words , to what extent the second project can produce that result because it appears that the total flow is always the same : if one side is closed off , immigration is diverted towards the other .
The people who will have to reform and convert their crops and their farming are the farmers , not just the bureaucrats .
In other words , rather than being simplified , the bureaucracy is increasing .
Thank you very much , Commissioner .
I believe , however , that we will only be able to achieve the desired objectives by means of a legally binding convention which includes civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights suited to the circumstances of disabled people .
I would just like to insist on certain points which are important , although other Members have mentioned them , and which we in Parliament and in the Group of the Party of European Socialists have been advocating : the existence , in many cases , of multiple discrimination - as a disabled woman or a disabled immigrant - eliminating legal barriers in order to eliminate physical barriers , education - which is very important - in values , which includes non-discrimination against disability in schools .
The truth is that we expected to have an assessment report beforehand on the situation of the populations , which , for technical reasons relating to the vessel which would have to carry out this type of investigation , could not be produced .
I would also like to say that I am pleased that the Commissioner has informed us that the next agreement will be negotiated for five years , because I believe this is the best way to offer ship owners , companies and professionals in the sector a framework for safety and reliability , which will allow them to make investments and rationalise their activities in a more consistent way than they were able to do simply through two-year agreements .
Agreements must also serve the Community in terms of establishing strategic alliances within international fora with a view to making effective progress in the fight against illegal fishing , which is the greatest scourge faced by sustainable fishing and the future of fisheries .
It is true , though , that at times we have had annual supplements , which have helped to finance some other projects .
It was introduced in the previous programme and we hope it will increase with this one .
The DAPHNE Programme has been an essential instrument for trying to combat this violence , but it has been restricted by its budget .
Mr President , the Commission 's proposal has its basis in Article 251 of the Treaty and therefore , Mr President , it is subject to the codecision procedure .
The accounts for agriculture are a basic tool for analysing the economic situation of agriculture .
The proposed draft regulation simply consolidates , as you have rightly pointed out , the practice which has existed for many years , since for a long time the accounts for agriculture have been established by the Union on the basis of a gentlemen 's agreement between the Member States and Eurostat .
With regard to the first point , there is concern for the methodology .
The concern is that , in some cases , rather than using the national currency as we propose , the euro should be used for everybody .
Mr President , I agree with Commissioner Nielson that since the Cuban regime unleashed its repression in March , with the detention of independent journalists and human rights activists , our relations have only deteriorated .
In view of this situation - as Minister Frattini has said - it is clear that it is not possible to change the common position set in 1996 and we must - and I address this directly to the President ?in-Office of the Council - prevent any gesture which could be interpreted as an internal difference within the European Union .
The only certainty is that the person with practically all the decision-making power is 77 years old and , therefore , things in that country are going to change .
In Argentina I saw children suffering from hunger in the Tucum√°n hospital , in Colombia I saw people killed - there are thousands of deaths every year - by paramilitaries and also by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) with the complicity of the paramilitaries , the justice system and the army , but when I reached Cuba I found that children were not hungry - on the contrary , infant mortality is amongst the lowest in the world - there is culture , there is education , there are not thousands of deaths every year - as there are in Colombia - and there is therefore an obvious contrast .
Because , as Fidel Castro quite rightly said in January 1999 - when the euro was put in place - the euro gives great hope that the developing world , and all countries , will be able to be freed from the yoke of the dollar .
And I would ask myself , Commissioner , whether in these circumstances , with a country which does not wish to have a link with the European Union - because it has rejected incorporation into the Cotonou Agreement for a second time ; with a country whose leaders reject Community aid ; with a country whose leaders insult and denigrate European Union Heads of Government ; with a country which imposes endless restrictions on the presentation of identity cards by the Commission 's diplomatic representative , it is worth , Commissioner , keeping the office in Havana open .
As the Uruguayan poet Eduardo Galeano said , Cuba hurts .
I believe that in the creation of that Convention spirit , which has been the key to
