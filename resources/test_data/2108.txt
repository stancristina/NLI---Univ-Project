, there is a problem in the Dutch version , and I understand that this also occurs in various other language versions .
Twenty years from now , after take-overs and bankruptcies , there will be three global concerns in charge , and mandatory protection of staff , the environment and consumers will prove impossible .
However , the economic interest of Mathias Rath , who dispatches products from the Netherlands to customers in Germany , where his products are banned , cannot justify an adaptation of the law .
( NL ) The promotion of international trade in gas and electricity leads to more problems in the field of the environment , consumer protection and price stability .
This is why I disagree with the purport of the Mombaur report on cross-border electricity trade , even if through the proposals by Turmes and Rapkay more attention is paid to keeping track of greenhouse gases and nuclear waste , to promoting windmills and total energy , and to consumer protection .
The Third World is too poor to consider matters of this kind , and in affluent America , company profits are more important than any other considerations .
A second reason is that religion , fundamentalism and the violation of human rights are lumped together , which is unacceptable to us .
Only in the past few centuries have women in different European countries acquired the same rights as men , such as the right to vote , the right to work , rights to equal remuneration , access to managerial roles , the right to dissolve a failed marriage and equal rights of inheritance .
It is all the more disappointing since we have just started the fourth ministerial meeting in the framework of the Doha world trade talks , now being overshadowed by a measure of that kind .
However , what matters is that we should also use Barcelona to launch a diplomatic offensive in order to make it clear to the United States that protectionist measures of this kind only lead to major disruption in free trade and with it , to a huge upset in the creation of jobs .
Our strength was , and still is , conflict prevention .
Nobody can regulate the world on their own .
Only last week , President Bush unleashed a fresh trade war by restricting steel imports by means of import tariffs .
With a straight face , he has proclaimed unilateral measures , measures which a ) are counter-productive to transatlantic relations , b ) do not conform to WTO agreements and c ) will lead to a wave of protectionism in the world .
Transatlantic relations are now in stormy waters .
Our boat should be big enough to weather the storms .
But we also need good helmsmanship .
Mr President , I am both angry and sad .
I would therefore like to know whether it would not be possible to draft a kind of 1408 that applies to the fiscal status of border workers .
It looks like Europe is not entirely happy with its latest toy , the 'euro ' . New areas of policy have to suffer interference from European institutions at the risk of being swallowed up by Brussels .
Education policy and policy allowing people to take part in the employment process belong with the Member States .
I have taken note of the Council 's statement that it will continue to discuss the situation in Chechnya during all meetings with Russian authorities .
For the time being , the Financial Services Action Plan has settled for the approach of streamlining the rules of the different supervisory authorities in the Member States as much as possible , and working towards a level playing field within the markets on that basis .
In my view , this comes too late , but we may ask whether we still nevertheless need to draw a functional distinction between supervision of conduct and prudential supervision .
It is good therefore that this condition is expressly included in the text of the directive which , so far , strangely enough , had not been the case .
We have had monetary union with Luxembourg for years , and it has effectively encouraged cross border payment transactions aimed at avoiding tax on moveable goods .
And we are pleased that other groups are also gradually beginning to recognise its importance .
The Agreement of Cotonou underlines the role of civil society .
Yet , I would still like to make a few observations .
I would ask the Commission to ensure that we can have concrete , up-to-date information at our disposal , so that we can take the right decisions in all these areas at the right times .
And indeed , the question then arises - and this is also addressed to the Commissioner - to what extent the relevant fisheries organisations in Gabon are actually involved in this agreement .
At the moment , it is insufficiently clear what the actual costs and benefits of the agreement with Gabon will be , also for European fishermen .
Regarding the implementation of this agreement , I would appreciate it if the evaluation of development measures were to be submitted to the Council and the European Parliament every two years .
This is why he would like legislation which offers the financial markets opportunities to develop .
All proposals to make the existence of foreign capital visible to national tax offices have , further to opposition , subsequently been withdrawn .
( NL ) The European Union pursues a policy which , on the one hand , discourages the smoking of tobacco products while , on the other , encouraging the production of tobacco by granting subsidies to tobacco-growing farmers .
- ( NL ) According to the Dutch Government , European agricultural policy is in need of reform .
