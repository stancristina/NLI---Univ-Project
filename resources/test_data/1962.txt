on their responsibilities by acting to stop these ecological and human tragedies repeating themselves year after year .
How many more Erikas do we have to endure before the powers that be deliver to us a proper port state control that is effective throughout the whole of the European Union , not just certain areas of it ?
How much more pollution do we have to endure before the industry delivers us tankers with segregated tanks and double holds ?
How many more seabirds are to die before shipping companies end the practice of cleaning their tanks at sea which , as our resolution points out , causes far more pollution than any Erika-type disaster ?
While I recognise that some progress has been made in areas like port state control and minimal crewing standards , we are still faced with what our late colleague Ken Stewart used to call 'ships of shame sailing in and out of our European Union waters : rust buckets badly crewed ' .
We need the Member States to act quickly and decisively .
We need our governments to put up the financial resources needed to give us effective control and we need them also to stop dragging their feet when it comes to maritime safety .
The Erika cost no human lives but it may have ruined many human livelihoods .
Just as the Sea Empress , just as the Braer did .
It is absolutely certain that all three left us with an ecological disaster .
My group 's sympathy goes out to the people of Brittany who have seen their area despoiled by this disaster , just as my group 's sympathy went out to the people of West Wales and to the Shetland Islands on previous occasions .
Is it not about time that we stopped expressing sympathy and started issuing enforcement notices to get rid of these ships of shame in favour of safe seas or we will be back again , later on this year , discussing a new motion for a resolution when yet another flag-of-convenience tanker sadly goes down spewing its crude oil all over the sea .
The time for resolutions has passed .
What is now needed is action .
Sadly , I fear , the Council will yet again fail to act and we will be back in the future discussing yet another maritime and ecological disaster .
Mr President , every time there is a disaster of this kind people say it must never happen again .
In reality we can never stop accidents happening at sea , but it is incumbent upon us all to learn the lessons whenever an incident of this kind takes place and apply those lessons to reduce risks in future .
The " Erika " incident was serious especially for the people of Brittany most closely affected , but it was devastating for the wildlife of much of Europe .
Some say that it is the worst accident that has ever befallen the bird life of this part of Europe .
The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds believes that as many as 400,000 birds , perhaps mainly guillemots , may have died .
The pictures many of us will have seen of oil-soaked birds being put down by veterinary officials were both distressing and tragic .
We all want the highest standards for ships whatever flag they may be flying .
We need to enforce the regulations and ensure that the "polluter pays " principle is applied so that financial penalties and some incentives are used to put pressure on both ship operators and oil companies to ensure that best practice is introduced .
I agree with every word the Commissioner said in her remarks , but the question is , how long will it take to ensure that measures are introduced to deal with the problem in the way she proposes ?
As a politician she needs to remind her officials how difficult it would be were she to have to come back to this Parliament in a year , were a similar incident , just as devastating , to take place , if some of the measures she has proposed today were simply still remaining as fine words and she had not had the chance to put them into practice .
The thought of an incident of this kind occurring in the near future should concentrate her mind and the minds of her officials wonderfully .
Mr President , I welcome the statement from the Commissioner .
Having spent a lot of time at sea myself I am well aware of the sea 's power and destructive force , which make a proper design and maintenance of ships and boats essential .
I would like to express my sympathy with all those who are dealing with the consequences of the breaking up and sinking of the oil tanker Erika .
This has been an environmental disaster as well as a deplorable waste of resources .
It should be noted that the oil industry , through the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds , regards itself as liable under the 1969 Convention and its 1992 Protocol , for over 90 % of the estimated cost of this incident , or some USD 170 million .
This suggests to me that we should also look to the shipowners , to the flag state and the inspection authorities to shoulder their share of the responsibility .
However , before we rush in with a whole raft of new measures and new regulations , let us look carefully at the existing arrangements to be sure that they are being properly implemented .
Better to heed calls to amend and improve existing legislation than to embark on new proposals .
In that context I support calls to strengthen port state control to ensure full and effective inspection
