Simplification and clarity , too , can result in stringent and necessary monitoring and even make it easier .
The Member States’ budgetary discipline , as demanded by the Stability and Growth Pact , is pro-cyclical in its effects .
The assessment of risks is , however , being made ever more complex and problematic by increases in the depth of processing and in the diversity of the procedures and additives used , while , at the same time , legislation becomes out of date more quickly .
You – any consumer – can easily get practical experience of this .
If it does not do so , it risks not only ending up before the European Court of Justice in infringement proceedings set in motion by the Commission , but also faces the risk that aggrieved parties in the persons of businesses , manufacturers and even consumers will act on the more recent case-law of the European Court of Justice and commence public liability proceedings against it before German courts , which could then petition the ECJ for a preliminary ruling , with the possibility of claims running into millions , if not billions , in compensation , for which sums the German Minister of Finance would be liable .
If you , Commissioner , are a supporter of the internal market , then it is your duty as much as anyone else’s to have an integrated approach to environmental policy .
The sight of wretched , hungry , thirsty people , including children – such as we have seen on the shores of the island of Lampedusa – shows that this is not just about the protection of our external borders , but about these pitiable people being given a chance in their own countries and not needing to get in their boats .
At the heart of this is our joining in defending our common values .
We have to clarify the point that an eastward-looking also means that we have to create a second option alongside full membership .
What gives my question ever more urgency is the appearance in today’s edition of , a newspaper with which you , Mr Berlusconi , may be acquainted , of an article by Mrs Sabrina Cottone from Milan , who interviewed Mr Bossi , in the course of which interview he said , ‘if the European arrest warrant is adopted , it will be a step towards dictatorship , towards terror’ .
I would have thought that growth is impossible without stability , for , at the end of the day , today’s debts are tomorrow’s taxes .     – Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , I want , in this speech , to focus in the main on the work of the Intergovernmental Conference , which forms , indeed , the centrepiece of the Italian Presidency of the Council , and which we want to encourage the Italian Presidency to complete before the end of this year , that being the only way of ensuring that Europe will continue , post-enlargement , to be capable of taking action , transparent and acceptable to its citizens .
If we succeed in resolving these problems as well , we will end up with a Treaty that really does deserve to be supported by people throughout Europe .
What the Lisbon process means is that the European Union’s policies must , of course , enable it to compete , whilst always taking account of considerations of the environment and of sustainability .
We have the concept of the internal market ; let us at last make it a reality .
The Commission and the Council have now proposed the establishment of a new agency , but the question arises of where it is to be located .
Although , Mr President of the Council , there is at present rejoicing at the unanimous adoption of the United Nations resolution , we must not abandon the objectives that this House has always pursued in relation to Iraq policy : a strong role for the United Nations and a progressive but speedy and clearly-defined transfer of power from the Americans , from the armed forces , to the Iraqis .
The first is that Europe must find its way to a clear prioritisation of its foreign and security policy interests and objectives , jointly define them and also designate them geographically , as we have done under item 8.
Such a report is no use when it comes to conducting dialogue between Parliament and the Council .
I think that we have now reached a new stage of dialogue with Commissioner Patten .
Reference has been made to Iran .
In Europe , we can currently see positive examples of how conflicts have not escalated into warfare , one example being the Caucasus .
The conflicts across the straits must be resolved by peaceful means , and so the rockets – which could be seen as a threat – must be withdrawn from China ’s coastal provinces .
As Mr Oostlander so rightly said , the war in Chechnya is doing nothing to remove these problems , but is making matters worse .
Commissioner Patten set out very well how we can proceed without losing sight of our fundamental rejection of the death penalty .
That is my first question .
I imagine that our societies would change too if suicide bombings occurred in Rome , Madrid , Brussels or Berlin on a daily basis .
Naturally , there are peace plans , such as the Geneva Accord and other initiatives , which we in Parliament welcome .
This is the starting point for our proposals , which I do not want to discuss in detail .
The Green Paper says nothing about the fact that equity should really be interest-bearing and how it should be taxed .
