on page 20 , and thus of the need for initiatives for programmes concerning education , poverty alleviation and the capacity-building of democratic institutions , the proposal unfortunately makes no reference to this point .
Mr President , I , too , would like to thank Mrs Montfort for the excellent work she has done .
Mr President , Mr Commissioner , I applaud this document and welcome the fact that Mrs Montfort has had occasion to bring to our attention the important role played by small and medium-sized businesses in Europe .
Mr President , unlike Mrs Pack , I am of the opinion that the more groups that are involved in Albania the better .
Anyone who knows anything about Albania knows that it is somewhat undiplomatic to name the players in public life there , as much can happen in dealings between countries in the throes of change and an industrialised world that has cast itself in the role of aid donor .
This is an awareness that we must all help to foster .
What Albania does need from us is tangible economic aid and genuine solidarity , but also a little firmness , because it must , with our assistance , go about reconstructing for itself a framework for the rule of law .
In the European Union , education and teaching is structured according to the principle of subsidiarity , with the result that the laws of the Member States differ .
The root of the issue is that it is impossible to grant a language assistant , a person who is well versed in English and comes to an Italian medical university to explain to the students what the Italian terms are for heart disease , operation , liver disease , and so forth , to have the same rights , on the basis of their having the same status , as someone who teaches medicine .
Madam President , I would like to speak on a point of order , regarding not the agenda , but the order of voting .
He will not be able to take part in our work for 60 days .
On the one hand , a representative of the Pensioners ' Party might welcome the presence of invalids - another pensioner perhaps - but , on the other , I would like all our Members to be safe .
This is an extremely serious initiative towards reintroducing censorship in Italy , limited to text books for the moment but which will soon be extended to other areas .
Ladies and gentlemen , are you sure that the European citizens , the national parliaments and you yourselves wish to pursue a functionalist strategy in the areas of justice and security , one of the pillars of democracy ?
Madam President , great importance is often attached to the signing of charters , and this often assumes legendary status .
Therefore , we feel that the Charter is only important as a position of principle , as a starting point for a debate : a debate which we consider useful for the future but which has yet to develop , which must take place alongside the unification process .
For example , the Italian Constitution lays down the limits of public morality and the European Convention lays down the limit of the rights of others and public safety .
The issue of its legal status could have been resolved now rather than in the dim and distant future .
The Charter of Fundamental Rights , with its constant referral to national laws and practices for the actual implementation of social rights , is liable to render irreversible this subordination , this unfair system of the wealthy few , this model of a liberal free trade society which is rising like a phoenix from the ashes of European social democratic ideals with striking speed .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , today , with the Charter of Fundamental Rights , Parliament is marking a new , important stage in the European Union 's journey , towards a more united and - I hope - fairer and more honest Europe .
The hopes of no one person here have been fully realised because the Charter cannot mirror the views of one section of the population alone , it must be the common point of reference of all those who feel that they are European citizens , in respect for the differences of others and peaceful co-existence .
To assert this is to disregard the history of the institutions : 'liberty , equality , fraternity ' are also fine words , but they formed the basis of many of Europe 's legal systems .
However , as has been pointed out many times , the text does not have the legal status of a treaty .
The Members of the European People 's Party , which has Christian Democrat origins , are convinced that the reference to Europe 's spiritual and moral heritage will strengthen the cohesion of a Union which values cultural and political differences .
This is my principle motive for supporting this directive , although I regret that Amendment No 65 , tabled by Mr Ferri and Mr Fiori , which called for the supervisory monitoring body to be made up of a body of several members , was not accepted .
Madam President , how could the Pensioners ' Party not vote for the Charter of Fundamental Rights ?
It is the first document of such importance in the whole world to contain an article - Article 25 - entitled ' The rights of the elderly ' , which reads : " the Union recognises and respects the rights of the elderly to lead a life of dignity and independence and to participate in social and cultural life " .
And the policeman replied : ' Because of the principle of not interfering in national responsibilities , the principle of subsidiarity
