this activity will continue .
The Council has also repeatedly demanded that human rights be respected and specific measures taken towards democracy and national reconciliation .
The Council would hardly describe its policy as constructive engagement , but rather as an attempt to achieve change by applying pressure by means of sanctions and through dialogues .
It seems now as if the mission will be undertaken later this month .
The Union is active within the ILO , in the UN Human Rights Commission and in the UN General Assembly .
So , allow me to assure you that the Council fully shares Mrs Kinnock 's concern with regard to the situation .
I can assure Mr Corbett that we probably have exactly the same opinion regarding what is necessary for the Council to be able to accept Burmese participation in this ministerial meeting .
Firstly , allow me to say that the presidency attaches great importance to the common fisheries policy and that we are fully aware of the difficult situation faced by the fishing industry after the drastic cuts in quotas etc . at the Council 's meeting in December of last year .
The Commission will table its proposals in the near future .
The presidency does not consider there to be much scope for taking support measures to the advantage of an individual Member State .
We appreciate the work the European Parliament has done in this regard but we are still not convinced that this will actually become reality .
When we discuss such important issues , it is important that all parties concerned are able to take part in the discussion in an appropriate way .
I think that it is quite obvious that this type of discussion should have a scientific basis , but all those involved , including representatives of the fishermen , should of course have the opportunity to participate in it .
The question raised by the honourable Member is , of course , very important , particularly for the fishermen who are affected .
, rapporteur .
Each year , over 42,000 people are killed on our European roads .
This is a matter of great human suffering and of heavy social costs .
To attain this objective , we must take a comprehensive view in which the ultimate responsibility lies with those who design the roads and the surrounding infrastructure .
In my report , I went on to concentrate on the forthcoming period of the Programme , which would have to cover a longer period - let us say , the period 2002-2010 - to enable a more long-term strategy to be adopted .
Each Member State must therefore devise its own roadsafety programmes ( which not all Member States have at present ) , including strategies for attaining the national targets .
Alcohol kills approximately 9 000 people on the roads each year .
According to the Commission , drink-driving is a question that falls under the principle of subsidiarity .
In my opinion , we should use these powers precisely in those areas where they have a real effect , and they do have a real effect where alcohol and driving are concerned .
The Commission should have waited for Parliament to have held its discussion .
In addition to this matter , and the matter of safer car fronts , the report contains a number of other important proposals for traffic safety measures .
The European Parliament has always been a force for the promotion of improved road safety , and we have to continue in this direction .
Last year , nearly 43,000 people were killed on the road networks of the EU.
Despite this , people are killed every day on the road networks of the EU because of this precise combination .
Why is it , then , that we do not impose the same requirement on those who drive on our roads ?
However , this is something we do accept when it comes to roads but which , of course , we do not where aviation is concerned .
We have not said no to a directive before .
I am well aware of the fact that this is an important issue for cyclists and motorcyclists .
We must make vigorous joint efforts to this end .
The material basis of this system consists of a division of labour according to gender which , at all levels of the hierarchies , assigns to women the tasks which are either unpaid or more poorly paid .
After all , it is not just in this Chamber - it also happens throughout the various sectors of society - that representatives of the Group of the European People ' s Party discuss the allocation of quotas and , for some reason I cannot fathom , have a terrible dread of allocating quotas according to gender .
It is said that women must be appointed on merit , but I should like to ask the question which , more often than not , employers and leading male politicians apparently fail to ask : What merits are we actually looking for ?
We are waiting for what is called the 'ketchup effect ' .
But the voices of women are absent when it comes to taking key decisions and setting priorities .
In order to achieve a balance , a concrete plan of action with a set timetable is needed .
It is mainly women who are victims of violations of human rights , such as rape , sexual offences , abuse in the home and trafficking .
The equal participation of women in decision-making processes is not only a matter of demanding social justice and democracy , but is also essential if women ' s experience and knowledge is to be made the most of .
Women represent 50 per cent of our Government and 44 per cent of the Swedish Parliament .
