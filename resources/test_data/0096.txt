Regrettably , my Group cannot vote in favour of this paragraph or welcome such campaigns .
I consider this very dangerous .
Unfortunately , progress in this direction is still inadequate .
This system must now be made to work openly and without discrimination against anybody .
The flood of complaints demonstrates that much still remains to be done at Member State level to eliminate obstacles .
Member States should compare applicants ' qualifications with those required in the host country , and if equivalence is established , an application for recognition should be granted .
The rapporteur rightly expresses surprise at the fact that it is not possible to obtain up-to-date statistics on a matter which affects citizens ' rights to such an extent .
Bearing in mind what has gone before , I also think it better that we do not regulate .
I am a little concerned that both the report and the Commission 's proposal suggest that we should .
There are no 'free lunches ' and what we are concentrating on at the moment is guaranteeing old levels of service .
As my colleague Mr Lindqvist has already said , in the Scandinavian countries we have had fantastic results following liberalisation .
We currently have a situation in which different Member States are at different stages of development .
I have expressed a certain amount of concern in my statement from the Legal Committee which has not been included by the Economic Committee .
We would like to see restrictions on when national regulatory authorities can intervene .
There is a risk , therefore , that they will intervene in a way which is discriminatory .
We representatives of the Suomen Keskusta party in the European Parliament consider that the Commission has been guilty of serious negligence in dealing with BSE.
We supported the resolution calling on the Commission to take speedy and effective measures to prevent the spread of BSE.
Mr President , Yamdena is an island in Eastern Indonesia , and the Indonesian Government has granted very extensive logging permits to certain forestry companies .
Our concern is that this logging may be carried out without any regard for the rights of indigenous peoples .
Has the Commission sent any kind of fact-finding mission to the area ?
The Commission has supported many forest protection projects in Indonesia , but now , in a way , the basis for this protection of forests is under threat .
Mr President , it is essential that the political decision-makers must take up a position without delay on the cloning of human beings and animals .
The knowledge of how to clone a mammal from a cell from an adult individual came as a complete surprise to the decision-makers .
The technology now exists for this purpose , and is moreover very simple and cheap .
We must ensure now that human beings will never under any circumstances be cloned and that research to this end will not be permitted , because it would be equivalent to inhuman experiments on living human beings .
Means must be found to prevent this technology from spreading into commercial use which could for example lead to the gene pool of cattle becoming dangerously weakened with incalculable consequences .
We must remember how mad cow disease came about .
Now the Renault case has given the Commission cause to take some of the measures called for by Parliament in that report .
The Commission proposes to investigate the ways in which businesses relocate to areas where they receive support from areas in respect of which no support is paid .
I should now like to know whether the Commission , spurred on by the Renault case , intends to set up such a monitoring unit to analyse the reasons for which businesses change their places of activity .
The Renault motor concern has announced that it will be closing its factory in Vilvoorde in Belgium completely and will be making staff redundant in France as well .
Is this an indication of how industry intends to get in shape for the euro ?
Economic growth alone will not banish unemployment , and structural interventions will thus ultimately also be necessary .
The plan should be to move the priority from taxing labour to taxing added value .
Let machines do the boring work and let people serve other people .
The problem is that the timetable for achieving the criteria is very fast and they are interpreted too strictly .
I therefore propose that two types of security should be included among the hard EMU criteria : economic security and social security .
Madam President , Commissioner , Mrs Morgan 's excellent report is welcome , because it is high time to stress the central position of education and culture in the information society .
Now is the time to redirect our resources towards developing content and improving quality .
The INFO 2000 programme should contain more support to this end , and the research programmes should stress the development of multimedia and programmes with an educational purpose .
Its a matter of whether everyone manages to obtain the information which is relevant to them and whether they have the capacity to assess and select from this information .
If this occurred to a disabled person who was carrying out his duties well and wanted to carry on working , I should gladly do my best to ensure that he was able to continue in his former duties , if this was in the interests of himself and the Community .
Mr President , we have a project on this very subject which is just now being launched .
Its purpose is to organize an architects ' competition together with the Brussels institutions and the Belgian authorities .
At present moving safely from one building to another in Brussels is completely impossible for disabled people too .
I am prepared to
