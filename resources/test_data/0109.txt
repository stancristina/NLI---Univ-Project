a generalised code of conduct .
Copies of those rules have been sent to the honourable Member and they are available on the Internet .
Against this background the following information may be useful to the House : the guiding principle of the system which the Commission uses is that appointments to all senior posts will be determined on evidence of the merit of candidates , including managerial capacity and other relevant abilities .
In order to take necessary account of the geographical balance to which I referred earlier and to do so in compliance with the essential principle of meritocratic appointment , specific provision is being made .
The Commission has rejected the concept of quotas because of its counter-productive rigidity , and also because it would breach Staff Regulations .
It has , however , adopted a decision to ensure that all Member State nationalities should be represented by at least 1 qualified person in the most senior post , Director-General or equivalent , and consistent with that , the Commission has given fresh emphasis to assess effectively proven merit as a prerequisite of highest positions .
The effects will be to maintain high standards of quality amongst the officials who lead the staff in the Commission in its vital policy , treaty application and management tasks and to do so whilst ensuring the broad geographical balance which is central to the character of an institution serving the whole of the Union .
The system for making promotion to the highest posts facilitates these purposes of sustaining merit and balance and I will summarise its operation for the information of the House .
Candidates for A1 and A2 jobs are interviewed by a panel of senior officials which has been assisted in the lifetime of this Commission by an advisory external expert with relevant experience in executive selection .
That panel makes an objective assessment of the professional and managerial qualities and capabilities that are relevant to the post and recommends a shortlist .
The shortlisted candidates are then interviewed by the portfolio Commissioner who is most directly concerned with the post and , in the case of A1 officials , by the Commissioner for personnel , who at the moment is myself .
The Commissioner responsible for personnel then formally proposes to the College the candidate who has been agreed upon with the portfolio Commissioner and with the President of the Commission .
In the case of appointments of Directors , the agreement of the relevant Director-General must also be obtained .
At all times the panel , the Commissioners and the College are conscious of the commitment to quality and balance and therefore apply that commitment consistently in the interests of the Commission and of the Union .
I can confirm that all appointments made by this Commission have been in accordance with these rules which are themselves based on Article 29 of the Staff Regulations and that will continue to be the course followed .
I apologise for the length of time I have taken up but , naturally , I wanted to give the House the most comprehensive information .
Mr President .
I very much welcome the opportunity presented by the question tabled by my colleague , Mr Pomés Ruiz , to be able to start the debate on what will be many issues in connection with Commissioner Kinnock ' s reforms .
I would like to thank him very much for the very comprehensive and open response that he has given to that question .
Today we have rightly focussed on what are the absolutely key appointments at the top of any organisation .
After all , your reform , Commissioner Kinnock , is going to have to be led from the top and we very much welcome the confirmation you have given about the way in which the top appointments have been handled .
What I would like to do in developing on Mr Pomés Ruiz ' question is to table one or two other points to you in connection with some of the more detailed aspects of the White Paper and the change in organisation that you have proposed .
Clearly the very ambitious reform contained in your paper is going to be a formidable task for the managers you appoint .
To achieve your objectives of moving the Commission towards a world-leading international public service , it is clear that the appointments and capabilities of your team are going to be critical .
You say in your White Paper that there is a real need to raise management skills and create a common management culture across the Commission .
I would like to know first of all how far you feel that management culture is now being developed by your new top team and how far that is starting to be communicated through the Commission ' s organisation .
The important and welcome news that we have had today about the appointment of a new Secretary-General , Mr David O' Sullivan , raises the question whether he has been involved already and will that have an impact on the development that you have already set in train .
The second point I wanted to raise has to do with what you identify in your White Paper - and I agree with this entirely - about the real challenges for any service organisation which is decentralising and delegating responsibilities to reporting managers , empowering them to take decisions and to have that all-important control of budget .
I would like your assurance that the new team that comes in has those skills and also , and this is particularly important , that it also has a commitment to developing team-work in the Commission .
This is going to become more and more important as we get more information-technology driven solutions , more horizontal team-working of the type that I know is moving into areas like the information society
