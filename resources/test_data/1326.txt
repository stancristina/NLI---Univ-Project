to data from the European Environment Agency , in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions we must focus on maritime transport .
Mr President , this proposal for a regulation on managing the Atlantic waters suffered a major setback at the last Fisheries Council , with the presentation of a proposal for a compromise by the current Presidency of the Union .
Discrimination exists when situations that are different and specific are considered to be equal , as is the case with Portuguese fishing .
I wish to thank those colleagues who , together with Mrs Figueiredo , voted for my amendment on access to waters in the Azores region .
Mr President , Commissioner , Chairman of the Committee on Fisheries and dear friend , Mr Stevenson , ladies and gentlemen , I am speaking to you at a particularly difficult time for the autonomous region of the Azores , as has already been said .
You said at the time , Commissioner , in Question No 26 : ' ? the Commission has a clear understanding of the validity of Regulations Nos 685 and 2027 .
A new set of regulations was adopted in 1995 to apply thereafter , with the agreement of everyone !
I am very grateful , Mr President , but I believe the Commissioner should tell us what the truth is : is it what he stated in his answer to Question No 26 - which is that the regulations are in force - or what he has just stated , which is that the regulations are no longer in force ?
The presidency did its best to achieve peace and to combat the idea that transatlantic relations must involve the subordination , and even the humiliation , of Europe by the United States , a prospect that is all the more dismal because that country is currently governed by the militaristic far right .
As a European and as a political representative of a nation-state such as Galicia , of course I want the Constitution to respect the national and cultural diversity that constitutes the fabric of Europe .
We hope that this will happen , so that everyone can benefit .
The Commission 's proposal to fund the action plan by reprogramming Structural Funds under the FIFG and its suggestion that it might use the mid-term review of the Structural Funds to try to obtain further resources from other Structural Funds are unacceptable .
The failure frequently ascribed to the previous common fisheries policy ( CFP ) should make the Union as a whole realise how crucial it is to have a carefully considered assessment , potentially forming the basis of a new approach , and for this approach to be reflected , if possible , in the new CFP.
Taking advantage of the fact that decision-making in the Council on the 'Statute for Members of the EP ' has changed from unanimity to qualified majority as a result of the Treaty of Nice , the EP is once again insisting on a proposal that contains aspects with which we disagree .
Furthermore , as we have emphasised , the social realities in the countries of the EU differ greatly , making it inevitable that implementing this measure will lead to profound inequalities and differences between the salary level of workers and that of representatives and public office-holders in various countries , such as Portugal .
I have therefore voted against the report once again .
In general terms , this is an attempt to impose competition rules on all sectors that involve public service , providing incentives for privatisation , calling into question the guarantee of security of supply , investment capacity , equal access to the best prices and to a high-quality service and will lead to the deterioration of employees ' rights in the sectors in question .
Energy is a strategic sector that is crucial to the sovereignty of any state .
According to data provided by the European Commission , it is possible to comply with the Kyoto Protocol by implementing measures costing less than EUR 20 per tonne of CO2 .
An agreement in this field could be important to speeding up the process of ratifying the Cartagena Protocol on biological safety and biodiversity .
Because there is no strong and integrated legislation on genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) that is able to provide guarantees for consumers and industry , the process of granting marketing authorisations at EU level has been suspended for the last three years .
I therefore welcomed the adoption of the Council 's common position - and the approximation of positions that avoided the need for us to continue with a conciliation procedure - and , as such , the forthcoming entry into force of a regulation that is clear , technically secure and able to put the EU in a different position to the one that culminated , as a result of the diffuse nature of regulations , in the anti-GMO moratorium that led the USA to lodge a complaint with the World Trade Organisation .
For this reason , this new proposal is particularly appropriate given the much-vaunted requirement for double hulls .
Improving technical catch measures must therefore be seen as an essential component of the common fisheries policy and must be considered in conjunction with the other instruments for the fisheries sector .
In fact , this omission would run counter to what Commissioner Fischler promised fishermen in a speech in London , when he urged them to 'come and participate and make sure that they become full players in the fisheries management process ' .
The Council must also take account of this proposal in its negotiations for a compromise .
It is , therefore , hard to understand the restrictions that have for a long time been imposed on the fishermen of these countries , paradoxically paving the way to the further depletion of fisheries resources .
