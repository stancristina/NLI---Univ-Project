the Council , at the end of this debate , I am left with a number of questions .
And what conclusions will we draw if nothing , or something , is found ?
What happens if a prior solution is not reached for Israel and Palestine ?
Are the two European countries on the Security Council , namely the United Kingdom and France , on the same wavelength ?
In my first point , I should like to comment on Mr Wurtz 's contribution and the indications he has given , in combination with , in my view , strong clues in the article in Newsweek , as well as in the footage which he and his fellow MEPs showed last time , that hundreds , possibly even more , Taliban have been killed under suspicious circumstances .
Militarily speaking , such support was in place in Afghanistan , in the form of the Northern Alliance .
Building a democratic society is a long-term commitment .
Anyone who fails to become rich fast , often at the expense of their fellow citizens , is considered a failure .
.
Cutting back on employee protection is therefore promoted as the best way of guaranteeing more employment , and aid is seen only as a last resort .
We must set this as a pre-condition , for if they are only given funding and are able to go back to shrouding women in burkas and confining them to the home , something is very wrong .
The Commission 's document , its view of EU-Asia relations , which is the topic of my report , is clear , coherent and shows understanding for the situation Asia is facing , and there is a desperate need for this .
Following a lengthy stay abroad , Mr Trinh had made investments in his own country .
Other Asian countries , including Cambodia or North Korea , did not escape the UN committee 's condemnation either .
Taiwan is a budding democracy with which we maintain sound economic ties .
His words inspire confidence .
A comprehensive and serious approach to ASEM IV was needed , and I hope that he will receive actual support within the Council for this .
Madam President , I can hardly conceive of a region that would be more difficult to draft a policy strategy for than Asia .
This is not terribly realistic , for , as is also recognised in Paragraph 14 , the EU does not yet have an effective foreign policy and certainly not an effective security policy .
Despite the crisis in Asia , trade and investment relations have expanded to such an extent that Asia is currently the EU 's third largest regional trading partner .
This results , for example , in the EU 's trade deficit with Asia which , partly due to the crisis , has increased almost tenfold over the past five years .
At parliamentary level too , contacts have improved over the past few years , as witness the recent ASEP meeting in Manila .
This process is far from easy , and this is why it is important for that country to receive our support .
Indonesia is vulnerable in this transitional phase to democracy , and this is why the Indonesian government deserves extra support from the European Union .
In my view , such a country does not belong in ASEAN and in the ASEM group .
I hope that this aspect will be given due consideration in the debates in Hanoi .
I believe that a better society could be the result .
The imports of food , of meat from other countries , have already been mentioned .
The idea that the entire production chain is to be monitored is increasingly taking root in different countries .
Moreover , the European consumer would be able to express a preference for European products from European farmers .
Secondly , there is a European Rapid Alert System that also applies to animal feed , and that , I believe , is functioning well at the moment .
Finally , Commissioner , I would once again urge the Commission to draw up of a positive list of products allowed in cattle feed .
This means , then , that there is a very important lesson we should draw from this , and that we should be aware that the inspection system , however effectively it has been set up , has failed thus far .
I hope that those who lost out will be receiving compensation from the governments responsible .
This is a matter of great importance and often discussed , but the question is : are we using the same guiding principles ?
This is about the right to work on one 's own personality development without necessarily focusing on the jobs .
In this area , the Commission still has a great deal of work to do , Commissioner , for we are , in fact , nowhere at the moment .
This is , in fact , causing me concern , for I do believe that it is vital that we should do this .
It is therefore for a good reason that the European Union - my congratulations to Mrs Reding , incidentally - is giving this topic so much attention .
We may need to set up a quality evaluation programme for this purpose , as is done in regular education .
I therefore endorse the request to exchange information , experiences and best practices at European level and to set up and maintain a European database .
What is more , I am also having to remain abreast of the latest developments in order to be able to communicate by e-mail with my children and grandchildren .
In this context , the government and employers need to ensure that the right preconditions and financial support are in place .
