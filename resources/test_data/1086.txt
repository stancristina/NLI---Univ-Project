The pros of this solution are as follows : first , it will not push up prices and put the industry in certain Member States in the south at a disadvantage .
Thirdly , it allows Member States to protect their small and medium-sized enterprises from distortions of competition caused by imposing a fixed tax .
Allow me to finish , Commissioner and members of the Council , by saying that I , too , want to see smoking reduced .
I do not think the price mechanism can be used to achieve everything .
Mr President , there is no doubt that cigarettes seriously damage your health .
What will happen if taxes are increased is that consumers on lower incomes will be forced to buy cheaper contraband cigarettes from third countries which are possibly even more damaging to their health .
The campaign against smoking benefits consumers ' health , while the campaign against tobacco cultivation benefits large-scale producers and industry , mainly in the USA , to the detriment of tobacco farmers and processors in southern Europe .
Finally , we suggest that revenue from tobacco taxes should be used to fund education , preventive measures and centres where smokers can kick the habit and obtain treatment .
Without wishing to judge , we must admit that Sharon 's policy has even made victims of the Israelis : he has painted himself into a corner with a no-win policy .
No, we are not .
And then we have another crisis within Europe .
Commissioner , thank you for your reply confirming that reactors 1 and 2 will be shut down this year , in 2002 , that work has in fact already started , and that reactors 3 and 4 will be shut down by 2006 at the latest , as originally agreed , as the President of the Commission , Mr Prodi , has assured me in writing and as you have stressed repeatedly .
My second question concerns the loan granted to Bulgaria to bring reactors 5 and 6 up to Western safety standards .
First , the target of full employment set in Lisbon was a political commitment by leaders of the Member States , not a binding legal commitment .
The problem lies with the employment services which Greece started to reform at the end of the second Community Support Framework .
The Commission is working closely with all the Member States and , as you know , it repeats the guidelines every year so that the Member States can take account of European agreements on the application of employment policies .
As far as the statistics which you quoted are concerned , we need to analyse the structure of unemployment in Greece .
According to the Commission 's recommendations , what the Greek government needs to do is to focus more on policies for women and young people and on policies for older workers , because here again very few older workers are actually in employment .
I should like to start , Mr President , with the tables of indicators announced by the Commission in its most recent communication , which will be sent to Barcelona .
These are the main objectives for the operational programmes for 2000 to 2006 .
Very substantial national funds are needed , together with efficient , urgent policies , especially for the information society , if these indicators are to improve significantly by next year .
And secondly , as regards the third Community Support Framework , which makes provision for all the major budget items which you mentioned , has Greece actually started spending any money ?
These jobs are not counted because the national employment agencies are unable to quantify the results of training but they are some of the important statistics which are required by the third Community Support Framework if we are to be able to monitor progress .
Greece 's response does , I think , bode well for the future .
By which I mean that the Greek authorities have introduced a series of measures dealing mainly with work inspectors , controls carried out by inspectors and the auditing agencies of the various insurance funds have been tightened up and , according to our information , a further 120 work inspectors are to be deployed .
Experts from all the Member States will attend this conference and the presentation of the study to discuss efficient practices for dealing with undeclared work which have brought in significant results in certain countries .
The open method of coordination established between the Member States does not , I repeat , involve any legal commitment vis-à-vis the Member States .
I do not share your optimism about progress because , as we can see in Greece and Italy - and I refer here to Greece in particular because it is my own country - there has been no progress .
I ask you in all honesty , do you feel that the means which you have at your disposal right now are sufficient to stamp out this phenomenon and its many and varied implications ?
Steps have been taken within an institutional framework to increase incentives to register workers and integrate immigrants .
As you know , Commissioner , where there is undeclared work there are usually undeclared businesses .
And their economic raison d 'être is that no one knows about them .
We ignore the main differences , we are not willing or perhaps able to do anything about them or our priorities lie elsewhere and we use the Bologna method to set targets which every Member State has yet to meet .
We need to find a way of formulating an opinion and a view before we are presented with faits accomplis .
I also share Mrs Martens ' view that we need more indicators on education systems , not just training systems .
The Communist Party of Greece never misses an opportunity to denounce the fact that the
