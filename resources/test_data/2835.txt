Some say that even before the launch of the Green Paper there could be little left of the Scottish fleet because of cuts in TACs , quotas and the proposed cod recovery proposals .
Others say that in order to have a fishing industry at all we need to conserve , they hark back to the 1996 article in Nature warning of the collapse of cod stocks .
I really do not know how you square the circle , but by the end of 2002 we must .
From talking to people in the industry , those involved in scientific research and those involved in conservation , it seems there is a willingness to be involved and a need for greater participation of all those concerned .
In Scotland , the Scottish Fishermen 's Federation and the WWF have joined forces and suggested a better way of working .
The proposal for zonal management and greater regionalisation of the CFP is a serious one that has the support of fishing and conservation groups alike .
In other countries there are also suggestions .
This can only be good for debate .
In conclusion , this year and next will provide an opportunity to get the CFP right .
I look forward to debating this on future Tuesdays in Strasbourg .
Mr President , I am very pleased to be able to speak in this debate on European Union cooperation with Bangladesh , a country I know well , a country I was proud to visit with the European Parliament 's delegation in the autumn of 1998 .
There are , of course , a great number of people with Bengali roots settled in London and other parts of the European Union , people originally from Dhaka , Sylhet and other parts of Bangladesh .
I know from them and from my visit that Bangladesh is a country of proud , hard-working people and a country with great prospects , but one which does need assistance from the more wealthy and developed parts of the world like the European Union .
This report helps provide that support and should be commended , and accordingly I pay warm tribute to the rapporteur and my other colleague .
But the rapporteur said something which struck me , as did Mrs Maes .
The rapporteur said that state structures in Bangladesh work badly and Mrs Maes derided some of the advances that Bangladesh has made in recent years .
Yet in many ways I think that Bangladesh is amazing for the way that it does work .
It does work despite its turbulent and violent history , despite the political problems , despite its other difficulties and despite the poverty .
It does function and , as the Commissioner has just said , that is amazing considering all the difficulties .
I believe that this is fundamentally a credit to the people and indeed to the Government of Bangladesh .
Now on the positive side - and some of you from other countries may not be aware of this - Bangladesh has lately been admitted as a full test cricket playing nation .
Perhaps more significantly , reserves of natural gas have now been discovered in the Bay of Bengal .
The European Parliament has to help ensure that Bangladesh is not exploited by the big multinational companies , that it is able to use its reserves properly and to sell them at the most competitive price , which may not mean just to India or to Russia .
The cricket aspect may seem irrelevant but it does show a determination to succeed and Bangladesh will do well in this field of test cricket and this will be an inspiration to millions of people in that country .
The report makes it clear that if the European Union works in partnership with local people it can help on big issues .
It can help with family planning , the key to stability for Bangladesh .
A poor or developing country cannot sustain a birth rate above two children per woman .
The idea that a large family is automatically the route out of poverty must be eradicated and women , all women , must be able to choose whether or not to have children .
European companies must also make certain that they do not exploit the cheap labour and do not continually perpetuate the working environment in factories , where the women suffer and work very long hours for very little money .
Furthermore the European Union has the expertise to help with other problems in Bangladesh - the flooding that we have heard about , that destroys great swathes of the land on a regular basis is not inevitable .
Europe has the know-how to prevent the deforestation .
We have the knowledge and experience , for example in the Netherlands , to help improve low-lying land and land susceptible to flooding .
We , as a European Union , already help Bangladesh with grants , with least-developed country status , and with the preferential access to markets that this brings with it .
But we can , I believe , and we must do more .
The future of Bangladesh also depends on its youth .
To my mind too many of the young people in Bangladesh leave to be educated abroad in Europe and the United States , which I commend , which is good ; but then many of them do not go back to Bangladesh to take back their education , their experience and their great strength .
We must encourage them to do so .
I will end as I began , by saying that Bangladesh is a country with a future .
Just as the last part of the twentieth century belonged to the countries of south-east Asia , the Tiger economies , I believe that the first part of this century can belong to the countries
