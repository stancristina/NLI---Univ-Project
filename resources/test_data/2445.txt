We should not of course immediately assume that deception was intended in every case .
I am particularly grateful for their support for the basic principles underlying the Commission proposal , on which we are in agreement .
We believe that the effect of this would be exactly the opposite of what we wish to achieve .
Just one brief observation , Commissioner .
However , as I have already said , it has been clear from the outset , as everyone affected knows , that there is a time limit on the measures to promote sales and that the objective is to facilitate the adjustments necessary to increase competitiveness .
Every farmer knew for exactly how many years he would be receiving support .
It cannot be right to bring in the Swedish method through the back door , because this implies working towards the goal of a drug-free society across Europe .
But I must admit my mistake .
In the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy we have been trying to ensure - and I appeal to all those colleagues who have been involved in this initiative - that important issues of this kind are not dealt with in the topical and urgent debate ; instead we want to ensure that proper treatment is reserved for them in the form of a committee procedure , an oral question or a Council statement .
The whole thing could happen as early as next week .
In stark contrast to these competing visions , however , is the way in which preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference are shaping up .
Mr President , I remain dismayed at the way in which Austria continues to be prejudged by 14 Member States of the European Union and believe that it is still far too early to assess definitively the overall consequences of the Feira summit .
After all , it would be disastrous if our lack of ability to reform became a yardstick by which enlargement was judged .
Thirdly and finally , it was not until paragraph 50 that the Heads of State and Government expressed their shock at the tragic deaths of the 58 refugees in Dover .
In mid-April our SAARC Delegation - of which I am Vice-Chairman - was able to see very clearly for itself in Delhi how much progress has already been made in restructuring the economy .
You see , you cannot help but notice a certain contradiction in the fact that these measures were intended to be entirely political and were also taken at political level and yet to find a way out of this blind alley - which is entirely desirable and in everyone 's interests - a solution is now having to be sought by means of a legal instrument .
We do not need closer cooperation on the social dialogue - that goes beyond the powers of the European Union !
This has now been done .
At this stage I should like to express my grateful thanks for the constructive cooperation which we have enjoyed with the Finnish and Portuguese Presidencies , and I am sure that in our further discussions we will also cooperate fruitfully with the French Presidency .
The Member States protect their financial interests in accordance with their laws , but the Communities do not have a police force or judicial authorities with which to bring defrauders before a judge so as to recover the lost money and impose punishments .
This poses serious dangers : a danger to the economy because of distortions of competition ; a danger to the company of being undermined , and a danger to the state whose stability is threatened .
At conferences I always explain it as follows : organised criminals simply cannot eat , drink and be merry to a sufficient degree to get rid of the money inconspicuously .
The amounts which change hands in the process run into billions .
We won the case before the European Court of Justice .
What is this ?
We will not therefore be making any recommendations here on how the report should be dealt with .
Furthermore , the Fléchard case should be kept open since a new state of affairs came about at the end of May , due , in particular , to the stand taken by the Court of Auditors .
Do you still stand by your statement that at the time , there were no grounds for involving the Fléchard firm , even though Commissioner Schmidhuber had raised the same question ?
He said it does not work for development assistance .
Thirdly , promotions were not being awarded in accordance with legally watertight criteria .
The issue would catch up with us again sooner than we might think .
In its report on the implementation of the 1998 budget , the European Court of Auditors had granted the Commission a statement of assurance for the revenue side of the budget and also for the implementation of commitment appropriations , but not for the implementation of payments from the budget .
If OLAF is asked , in preliminary investigations taking place at Member State level , to pass on information for reasons of investigation secrecy , at an appointed time , then this is a binding legal basis for OLAF .
This ought to send out a clear signal that we are committed to creating efficient and economical administrative systems in Europe .
I have a problem with your closing comments , Mrs Schreyer , in which you again presented the new Commission ' s entire reform project , and would remind you of what President Prodi said in this House about Parliament ' s access to documents , namely transparency and open access .
When are the legislative proposals for a comprehensive legal and judicial
