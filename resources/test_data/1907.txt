and in local elections , public information and , most of all , information for the young people who will make up the heart of the Union in the future .
The submission of a report must be characterised by simple , brief and transparent procedures , which the rapporteur failed to emphasise in his report , so that citizens will not hesitate to make proper use of their right .
We cannot ignore this .
He told us in committee and projected the usefulness of a European tax .
Answer for yourselves .     – Mr President , European citizenship does indeed , as Mr Catania quite rightly says , depend on nationality .
As long as some people continue to see immigrants as second class citizens , as long as they believe that people who do not have European blood cannot acquire European rights , as long as , instead of integrating immigrants , they wish to keep them indefinitely in a grey zone , then immigration runs the risk of turning from the big hope of Europe into its big time bomb .
No European law is needed for that .
Congratulations my honourable friend , and congratulations also to Commissioner Frattini on the sensitivity which he has shown and for the views which he expressed today on this issue .
It is a fact that there is social tolerance of prostitution in all the Member States of the European Union .
There is zero tolerance in words , but no results in practice .
So an end to hypocrisy on the part of society , the state and individuals .
The European Parliament is being called on to approve the Prets report by an overwhelming majority because , apart from anything else , it adopts for the first time the position of making the acceptance of such sexual services incriminating .     – Madam President , trafficking in human beings , especially women and children , is as old as human society .
I congratulate you , Commissioner , on the integrated approach to your recent communication and on the Council 's action plan .
The Community institutions are being called on here to safeguard the coordination and cohesion of activities by international fora .
There are a great many reasons and responsibilities at all levels .
However , the European Union has certainly played a positive role in raising awareness , in cooperation and in addressing the phenomenon .
Judicial and police cooperation need to be stepped up , using the facilities of Europol and Eurojust .
The words 'trafficking in human beings' , 'sexual exploitation ' and 'forced prostitution' , at both national and global level , encompass the risk of a pandemic similar to that which poverty and hunger have created , mainly in the developing countries , in the lower echelons of these societies .
However , when vulgar tactics are applied , such as coercion , constraint , kidnapping and threats to unprotected communities , by which I mean women and underage children , then I consider it incomprehensible for us to remain impassive to and remote from the phenomenon of violence and infringement of our human dignity and fundamental rights .
We are all jointly responsible , given that the punishment of traffickers and their accomplices is and remains a theoretical act , not the demonstration of strength in practice that we should all engage in .
I ask you , Mr Frattini , is the Commission doing anything in this direction ?     . – Mr President , I shall refrain from referring to the specific objectives of the European Union and the outcome of the negotiations in Hong Kong subject by subject .
Average because , on numerous crucial issues of global trade governance there was no substantial progress , just declarations of programmes or declarations of intent .
There is no alternative which can safeguard economic integration and development , the effective management of increasing economic interdependence and the peaceful and fair resolution of differences .
I am certain that the European Union will continue its effort and will develop dynamic initiatives to bring the round to a successful close .
The WTO is proving to be an imperial organisation which serves the interests of the multinational groups of big business .
At the same time , by opening the markets to natural resources , the consequences will also be disastrous for the environment .
This proves that agreements through the World Trade Organisation are simply cowardly ...     .
It underlines the importance which both our institutions ascribe to meeting the challenge of climate change and to the role of the multilateral procedure in the course of doing so .
The Kyoto Protocol has now been put into full operation , while the agreement on the Montreal action plan paves the way for discussion of future international cooperation on climate change issues .
All the parties which have not ratified the Kyoto Protocol , including the United States and Australia and , of course , all the major developing countries , are included in the Convention dialogue .
A special ad hoc United Nations working group has been set up within the framework of the Kyoto Protocol .
The five-year adaptation work programme contains a full set of activities , including work designed to further enhance our knowledge of the impacts of and the problems caused by climate change .
Thirdly , the Montreal Conference went further , making the Kyoto Protocol a stronger and more effective system .
The Clean Development Mechanism was strengthened .
The parties also pledged a sum of money to the operation of the Clean Development Mechanism .
This means that it is possible to speed up the approval of the joint implementation tasks for which plans have already been drawn up .
The acute interest in the emission rights trading system which we have introduced makes it clear that we are an example worth following .
