the nature of this problem demands a response which cuts across what otherwise often divides us in politics .
I have a number of more specific comments to make .
I , too , was making the same point , and others have also emphasised it .
If we are to contribute some hope to Africa , it is here that something is to be done .
The figures which a number of people have quoted , tell their own story .
Mrs Maij-Weggen said that what we are seeing is a breakdown of the societies concerned and that the progress which has been achieved is being undermined .
Producing better statistics and providing better information to the rest of the world about just how bad the situation in fact is , could be factors in increasing understanding among our populations of the necessity of increasing our efforts on behalf of Africa , and also generally , because this particular problem is bound up with the general situation in Africa .
In Zimbabwe , it is very useful to obtain clear public statistics , not only about how bad things are there and how many people have been affected , but also about the results it has been possible to achieve over a number of years in neighbouring Tanzania and Uganda , and in Senegal .
I have also noted in the debate about condom use that there is very broad agreement as to the crucial importance of making condoms available at low cost and of providing the population with accurate and straightforward information , as has been the case in Tanzania , Uganda and Senegal .
There , 25 % of women giving birth for the first time are HIV-positive , and more than 30 % of women giving birth in maternity wards at the local hospital are also HIV-positive .
We visited a number of nuns involved in an AIDS project .
I asked them if the question of condoms was discussed in their educational work .
They answered that they could only accept and recommend the use of condoms where prostitutes or similar groups were concerned .
This was a hard line to take , I think .
I think that the moral aspect of the matter and the question of where our duty lies can also move the discussion on .
It might also be said that when , in relation to formulating conditionalities , we talk about structural adjustments and macro-economic support for these countries , it might be worth discussing certain conditionalities in regard to the countries ' ability to ensure survival of their own population .
Survival is also a human right .
The budget problem has been referred to by almost everyone in the debate .
In fact , it cannot be deduced .
We are in the middle of an operation involving many more budgetary headings than the one discussed .
It is an operation aimed at simplifying and clarifying the budget .
What we are doing about HIV and AIDS cannot be deduced merely by looking at the particular heading in the budget which has been discussed .
This is a significant weakness in the organisation of the whole reporting process and of efforts to make information available .
The aim is that we should be able to report precisely , to our own public also , on what it really is we are getting for our money .
As I said in the introduction , there are now EUR 25 million on the way as an extra input into this area , and this sum has been taken from a variety of resources .
Mr Wijkman mentioned relations with other organisations , and the WHO was mentioned by another speaker .
This is an important part of improving the quality of what we offer , especially from the recipients ' point of view .
I can therefore answer positively that this is something of what we want to aim for .
Those are my comments .
Finally , I would point out that , in a week ' s time when we have the debate in the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in Nassau , I should very much like - if it is possible against the background of the questions I shall be answering - for us to discuss some of these themes there too and pass on some of the same messages which have characterised the present debate .
Mr President , a sensible energy policy should aim to change behaviour at every stage .
If we take the Kyoto targets seriously - as we hopefully do - then we must also follow them up with the relevant tools and resources .
In view of the obligations we have assumed in regard to CO2 reduction , it is urgently necessary to establish ambitious efficiency targets .
As Mrs Ahern pointed out , the target ought to be at least 1.5 % , and the budget ought also to be larger .
Linking of this kind means that nuclear power cannot merely be left , as some would wish , to replace existing power stations which pollute the atmosphere with CO2 emissions .
It is often emphasised that nuclear power is one of the cleanest energy sources and does not discharge greenhouse gases .
I totally disagree with this .
I am also completely in agreement with Mr Van Velzen in believing that the countries of Central and Eastern Europe should be permitted to take part in this programme .
Mr President , with Nelson Mandela' s farewell as President and the election of Thabo Mbeki , South Africa entered a new political era .
It is not good for a democracy to have a god as President , and Mandela was and remains a deity .
By this , I do not mean that Thabo Mbeki does not have god-like characteristics .
