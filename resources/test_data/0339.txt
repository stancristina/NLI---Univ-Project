In fact , neither the adoption of a Charter of Fundamental Rights on the cheap , nor the extension of qualified majority voting in areas of lesser importance , nor the on-going liberalisation of public services , nor the increasingly widespread use of enhanced cooperation in the field of defence will persuade the European public that Europe is heading in the right direction .
The first is that we need to ensure that the poorest or less developed regions are not sidelined from technological progress and are integrated into the information economy on an equal footing .
You yourself referred to the gap between the poor regions - between the ten poorest and the ten richest regions - but if you analyse the figures , you will be forced to see that the gaps are even wider in these regions when it comes to simple criteria such as the number of Internet connections .
First , energy efficiency .
However , I understand that this concern needs to be coordinated with other instruments , especially - as you suggested earlier Mr Markov - with the European Social Fund .
I also share your wish to take recourse to the package of appropriations decided within the framework of Agenda 2000 in order to implement innovative measures .
This point is very important to some enterprises , to enterprises which are , in fact , highly innovative .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am not particularly qualified - in fact none of us is - to deal with this question which is , as the Commissioner has said , a technical problem .
Mr Bourlanges ' finding is correct .
In the former Yugoslavia and Timor , the UNHCR has decided to protect all displaced persons and provide humanitarian aid for them , irrespective of whether or not they are refugees .
It would therefore appear to be perfectly logical to call on all countries , especially those who are candidates for membership of the European Union , to support this move .
Some , such as Béchir Habid , are in a critical condition .
Even if a few passports have been returned , even if President Ben Ali delivered a speech on the freedom of the press and improved prison conditions on the anniversary of his taking power , there has been a marked deterioration in the human rights situation in Tunisia .
And still the Tunisian regime is committing one violation after another and sinking deeper and deeper into generalised police repression .
And yet , here is a country which can lay claim to many spectacular successes during its development - which is perhaps the first human right .
If we wish to safeguard our credibility , we must be firm with Laurent Gbagbo in refusing to sanction this dangerous , uncontrollable slide off course .
Its leaders , whatever their political hue , have supported in turn the dictatorship of Houphouët-Boigny , the authoritarian and corrupt Bédié regime , the leader of the putsch , General Guei , and today Gbagbo , a would-be Socialist but in fact an out-and-out xenophobe .
If that is the case , maintaining a single motion would be a mere formality , in which case I withdraw our group ' s motion for a resolution .
That may appear to be a handicap as far as many people are concerned , in the first analysis .
Indeed , how is it possible to promise the elderly prosperity and solidarity without affirming the right of every worker to have a decent retirement pension , and what I mean by a decent pension is their full wage ?
The establishment of an ad hoc management committee has been proposed , which would have competence for the promotion of agricultural products .
Mr Dary , bravo , you have mastered the art of communication , and this is precisely the reason why you were appointed to draw up the report before us right now .
In those times , the Rule of Saint Benedict required monks to drink one 'hemina ' , or about half a pint , of wine before meals in order to awaken the spirit and aid digestion .
However , Mr Poettering , I would like to tell you that the Conference of Presidents certainly did not vote for or against this motion and it was suggested that I should table this motion in Parliament , which I have done .
Madam President , in order to avoid competition arising between these two issues , would it perhaps be possible to discuss the situation in Algeria in the 'human rights ' section , in which case , all the issues proposed could be dealt with .
As far back as 1998 , at a conference in Prague attended by 26 European countries , the national Ministers for Education agreed to implement a system of common indicators for their methods and results .
It is simply a matter of together finding out the best practices , without , a priori , setting targets in precise detail beforehand and of allowing each country to draw their own conclusions .
The draft recommendation is , to a great extent , based on the conclusions which we collectively drew from this research .
Moreover , that is a considerable loss for a society that needs all its human resources in order to progress .
Since the last time sites were selected in December 2000 , 690 sites have been added to the World Heritage List , 208 of which are located within the European Union .
The Commission should draw up a report on the position of restorers in Member States with a view to structuring the restoration sector in order to guarantee the quality of such work .
The importance of musical heritage or literature in the oral tradition may be emphasised , the task of collection , analysis and protection of which still remains to
