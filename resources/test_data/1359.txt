increasingly , colleagues could recognise that money is not just a reflection of importance , and that it is possible to vote strongly for a report without increasing the money .
I fear I may have to wait a long time to see that .
Given my advancing years it may be my successors who see that approach first .
Mr President , I refer to the comments made in this Chamber on Monday afternoon with respect to the anti-nuclear demonstration at the Faslane nuclear submarine base in Scotland .
As you are aware , I took part in that demonstration , and I would like to thank all those Members who expressed support for the action that I took when I participated in the largest-ever blockade of the base and was arrested , ironically enough , for committing a breach of the peace .
I just want to say a word to those Members who implied that my actions were somehow irresponsible or inappropriate .
Firstly , nuclear weapons are not only immoral and inhumane , they are also illegal .
The International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled that the possession of nuclear weapons is contrary to international law , and this was reaffirmed by a Scottish court in 1999 .
My action on Monday was therefore upholding the law , not breaking it .
Secondly , I believe nuclear weapons pose such a threat to all of us that it is legitimate and indeed essential to use all peaceful avenues open to us to try to rid our countries of them .
Of course there are parliamentary channels to use to do that , and I use them , but I also believe it is legitimate and essential to use extra-parliamentary channels as well .
It is our responsibility to use them .
A democratic state is not just a gift and right , it is a responsibility .
If citizens do not responsibly demonstrate against the operation of inhumane acts by their governments , the governments become increasingly irresponsive and corrupt .
Finally , it is the right and duty of every citizen , elected or not , to use all peaceful avenues to try to uphold international law .
My action on Monday was one further small step in trying to achieve that .
Mr President , to pick up on the points that Mrs Lucas has raised , I support the sentiments which she has outlined .
However , I would ask if she could prevail upon her colleagues to desist from claiming some sort of parliamentary immunity every time she gets arrested at Faslane .
Long before Mrs Lucas became involved , I had been involved in Faslane for many years and have been arrested there .
I have never once called for parliamentary immunity .
I had my day in court and I had my trial .
I will not go down the road to parliamentary immunity because I want my day in court and I want to make my point and not hide behind some smokescreen .
Mr President , can I just establish for yesterday 's Minutes a correction to my vote .
I intended to vote yes on the RÃ¼big Report .
Mr President , my point also relates to the Minutes .
I wonder if it might be recorded on page 11 in the English version of the Minutes , at Item 8 where we talk about voting time , that the votes commenced at 12.12 p.m.
They were advertised on the screen as commencing at 12.15 p.m. and for that reason some of us missed some of the early votes .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Swoboda for his speech and also the report .
My group supports the regulation , not only because of its technical and financial value to Turkey , but also for the political message it sends .
The regulation is a confidence-building measure .
It shows we treat Turkey 's candidacy for European membership with the respect that it surely deserves .
It squares Turkey 's candidacy with that of the other states , sending a signal that we will be fair and straightforward with Turkey and setting an example of the political consistency that we expect and require from the Turks .
The regulation will trigger a raft of reforms .
It is certain that the quality and pace of reform in Turkey will be driven by the developing relationship with the European Union .
The next step must be the national plan , published quickly and fully responding to the Accession Partnership programme .
We need this national plan to ensure that the momentum that supports European integration in Turkey does not diminish .
We in the Liberal Group will assess this national programme for reform critically but fairly .
Mr President , the Accession Partnership sets out a series of important and challenging priorities for Turkey to address as part of its preparations for European Union membership .
It will certainly test the resolve of Turkey to carry out much-needed reforms in the area of human rights .
A very topical aspect of this relates to freedom of expression , the functioning of the judicial system and the conditions in Turkish prisons .
This has been mentioned by previous speakers this morning and I spoke on this subject during our debate last month .
Following the adoption of a resolution by this House on the situation in Turkish prisons , I wrote to the Turkish authorities drawing particular attention to the request that Members of this Parliament should visit Turkish prisons to see the situation for themselves .
On 5 February , I received a reply from the Turkish Ambassador informing me that the Turkish Ministry of Justice was willing to allow a delegation of MEPs to visit F-type prisons in order to see some of the problems and the steps being taken to overcome them
