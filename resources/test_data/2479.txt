, our fellow Member Mr Rübig !
This ensures that victims have easier access to compensation , even if the crime was committed outside the person’s own Member State .
However , I emphasise the phrase ‘unmodified cells and tissues’ , because if drugs are produced from cells and tissues , then of course the investments made by industry in these drugs have to be refinanced , and for this reason , we need to provide for the opportunity for these products to be sold .
If , on the contrary , I say yes , and that the resource should be barred to fishing , this may well promote the replenishment of the stocks , but even then many jobs will be lost in the fisheries sector and in the businesses that depend on it , never to be replaced , and it may be that regions will lose expertise that will never return there .
Turning to Amendment No 6 , I have to tell you that these technical measures can , if need be , supplement restrictions on fishing effort , but cannot replace them .
Our discussions of railway policy give me the feeling that it is far from clear to many of those responsible that far more is at stake than whether or not this or that area is opened up to traffic ; this is really about a great transport project called ‘European Unity’ .
For a long time , in this region , the land of the great lakes , we have seen very violent conflicts , even going as far as genocide and mass expulsions , which , if we merely apply short-term remedies , will only keep on recurring .
We therefore call on the Council to appoint a special ambassador to Nepal , with which , Commissioner Lamy , the Commission must build up the EU’s relations .
Thank you .     Mr President , I want to return to the question of the agenda and of Mr Wuermeling’s report .
Opinion polls , whatever questions are put , can sometimes tend to make you feel queasy .
The question in fact arises as to whether there is any sense , under these circumstances , in again entrusting the Commission with the drafting of a proposal .
It turned out that , in the 1 400 sectors that we monitored , preparations are running perfectly according to the timetable in 70 % of all cases and that no comments are called for .
I therefore predict that all these cases will be resolved as a matter of course before 1 May 2004 .
Although we can regard it as a sort of compliment that both countries are very keen to complete negotiations before the present Commission leaves office , we are very cautious when it comes to making a statement about this .
In our strategy paper , we have linked Turkey’s desire for accession to the Cyprus issue .
Now for my second question .
We are dealing here with derelictions of duty by individuals .
At the same time , we also identified problem areas and then sent out what we called ‘early warning letters’ , the sort of thing that in my schooldays in Germany was called a ‘blue letter ’ – I believe that , in English , they are called ‘red letters ’ – which always contained the threat that if you did not buckle down to work at once , then you risked having to repeat a year .
At present we are working extremely hard to show the Principality of Liechtenstein and the Czech Republic a possible way out of this problem .
As regards the Roma , they were and are , as you know , the main focus of our pre-accession efforts , and we will not declare any country ready for accession that has not devised and implemented a viable strategy for their integration .
My third point is that we want good partnerships .
Even if we do not recognise this election , we know that the result will greatly influence what happens next .
I will readily concede that we are dealing with an extremely complicated system but that , if you want to discuss who is responsible for the fact that we have or must have such complicated structures in this area , then that is quite a different matter .     Mr  Queiró , I do not think that it would be sensible for the Commission to reopen the issues associated with Hungarian Status Law .
This causes great problems and I ask you , Commissioner , to really urge Romania to do something to counter this ; it would be in their own interests .
I would , however , urge you to evaluate the progress in regular personal dialogue with me as we often did last year .
I ask myself what the Intergovernmental Conference is actually doing in this area .
In its first meeting , the Legislative Council thus removed the separation of powers element and the public nature of legislation , without debate .
The Intergovernmental Conference is in reverse gear .
The Heads of State or Government who took this Union down the blind alley of Nice must now bring it out again .
The sectoral councils actually have no part to play in the Intergovernmental Conference , and the Ecofin Council’s attempt is directed not only against the Convention but also against the Thessaloniki summit .
The fact that the legal act is not yet available is regrettable and is already having repercussions .
In order to take some of the sting out of administrative decisions , the Commission should give applicants the opportunity to correct formal errors within a set period from submitting the application .
All three reports contain institutions and associations which are active as cultural ambassadors for Europe in the widest sense and which promote and foster the common cultural heritage in Europe .
