capable of this .
Nevertheless , the use of excessive military force to destroy civilian areas in the Palestinian territory is totally reprehensible and cannot be justified , even though it is said to be a war against terrorism .
Neither should Israeli troops be allowed to prevent wounded and injured Palestinians from getting to hospital .
If the Israelis believe that their country 's future can be secured only through the might of their army , in the long term , they will have made a tragic error .
In the same debate Hans-Gert Poettering remarked that it is extremely important for the future of us Europeans that we achieve peace in the Middle East and that we should work effectively and in peace with all the Mediterranean countries .
If we do not see any sort of harmony or desire for peace in the region , we may alter our policy .
We have the option of terminating the Association Agreement with Israel and we have no desire either to finance any operation that we may reasonably suspect is continually breeding terror and endorsing its use against Israel .
What Commissioner Patten has just said in a way is totally inconsistent with this news .
The killing must end immediately .
The proposal for a directive as part of the second Erika package has focused attention on the matters that are essential for increasing safety at sea and reducing the environmental damage caused by accidents .
The risk of accident has grown , however , with the increase in traffic .
The committee has once again adopted some proposals to improve safety that are not contained in the Council 's common position .
Likewise , we must see to it that essential search and rescue services are properly organised .
Because the directive should be adopted and implemented swiftly it is not appropriate to wait around for the decision of the meeting of the International Maritime Organisation in December .
I would furthermore like to draw your attention to the fact that decisions taken by the Union alone to raise levels of safety at sea are not enough .
Mr President , I warmly congratulate the rapporteur , Karl-Heinz Florenz .
Under his direction Parliament has been able to have a central role in bringing together the views of consumer associations , environmental organisations and producers also .
The directive will be an important application with regard to the producer 's responsibility .
It will create incentives for more environmentally friendly design and for innovations before products have yet come on the market and so reduce the ecological burden of products throughout their lifetime .
The European Union is now making legislation that will clearly show to the rest of the world that the conflict between consideration for the environment and the economy is not unavoidable but one that can be settled through carefully considered legislation .
Secondly , it would allow an opportunity for 'free-rider', which would penalise honest and respectable producers .
Thirdly , it would increase the public tax burden since no proportional reduction in existing taxes can be anticipated .
I think Parliament 's work in connection with this directive has succeeded so well as a process that it would be worth exploring and clarifying what courses of action we could adopt more frequently for the future .
Mr President , it is strange to be debating Chechnya right now , as we are sending a delegation in a few days ' time to learn about the matter we are now asking and speaking about .
It obviously cannot be true that everyone in Chechnya is a terrorist , which is what has also been said in Russia .
Ladies and gentlemen : I have ten observations to make .
This brutal war cannot be solved with weapons ; even Russia now admits that .
The conflicts could be eased through international mediation and I am working on the assumption that the delegation 's Executive Committee and our counterparts in the Duma will together try to look for political solutions .
The Russian army has not withdrawn because it trades illegally in oil and arms in the region .
The Chechens ' economy must be made transparent to avoid corruption .
Mr President , my congratulations and thanks go to my colleague , Mr Gra√ßa Moura , for a balanced and thorough report .
Nokia , for example , already employs more than 4 000 staff in the manufacture of mobile phones .
WTO membership will also lead to social and political pressures in China .
We are pleased to welcome China 's involvement in the international effort against terrorism and the rapprochement between China and India .

Mr President , following consultation yesterday , I should like to propose an oral amendment to the end of paragraph 41 , adding a few words which take into account the actions taken by the political groups in response to criticism a couple of years ago from the Court of Auditors .
That is the addition and it is also in the voting list .
Paragraph 43 orally amended is much the same in terms of content as my own Amendment No 13 .
Mr President , Commissioner , the speech we just heard was in fact an excellent bridge to mine .
This shows that there is no generation gap in the European Parliament at least .
If the post of EU liaison officer for senior citizens were to be created the rapporteur , our colleague , Carlo Fatuzzo , would be the most likely candidate for the job .
The way in which he devotes himself to his work is unequalled .
The report is based on significant social phenomena .
There are such considerable differences between pension systems in the various Member States that the responsibility for regulating the organisation and funding of statutory pensions must be that of the Member States alone in the future also
