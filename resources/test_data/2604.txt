, under a new regulation to be approved and to apply from the 2003-2004 marketing year .
As part of this method , it proposes to freeze nominal prices at 1983-84 levels for a further two years , thereby cutting actual prices and incomes , irrespective of the fact that the extended freeze on sugar beet prices eroded actual prices by 33 % between 1982 and 1999 .
Further reductions in quotas , together with similar cuts in all agricultural produce , will leave even more farmers high and dry and yet , there is not a single proposal as to what crops they should grow .
Mr President , unfortunately , because we have no consistent , integrated policy on asylum and immigration , we are being bombarded by initiatives by Member States trying to intervene , in a totally fragmented manner , in various areas , and either ignoring or circumventing the institutional and legal framework of the European Union , as in the case of the present initiatives by France , Finland and Portugal , which the European Parliament would do well to reject , precisely as our rapporteurs , whom I congratulate , have proposed .
In resorting to these tactics , the Council is doing nothing to speed up the process of shaping a common European immigration policy ; on the contrary , it is being obstructive , it is failing to take decisions and the Tampere process is making no headway whatsoever , thereby sustaining a climate in Europe which fosters racism and xenophobia and results in the sort of accident which we saw in Dover .
Of course , we hardly need stress yet again that fortifying the borders and policing measures will do nothing to reduce migratory pressures and illegal border crossings as long as there is a huge prosperity differential between our countries and our neighbours .
They respond to demands by the Member States of the European Union either for greater flexibility as regards the period of residency of immigrants and a more lenient Community institutional framework , as in the case of Portugal , or for faster action on the decisions taken at Tampere on mutual recognition by all the Member States of decisions on the expulsion of third-country nationals , as in the case of France .
Perhaps there is no institutional framework ?
The causes of immigration stem , in our view , from the very policies of developed capitalist countries and the European Union , which plunder the wealth and rob the people of the fruits of their labour in the immigrants ' countries of origin , condemning them to a life of under-development and poverty .
Can there by any doubt that what we have here is an inhumane interplay of the interests of slave traders , immigrants , war-mongering imperialists and those who exploit immigrants in the so-called host countries who , basically , as modern-day slave-masters , encourage unemployment and illegal immigration in order to attack the interests and rights of local workers in the coarsest manner ?
.
The WTO , which was set up in order to speed up the full liberalisation of trade , is one of the mainstays of the new world order .
Its direct outcome will be lower farmers ' incomes , less farming and higher unemployment .
Democratisation presupposes respect for and the protection of the rights of the workers .
It sends out a message of resistance and counterattack to the millions of workers , unemployed and small and medium-sized farms and to all the victims of the capitalist world order which the WTO wishes to impose .
The accessibility of the environmental data held by the authorities is crucial to raising public awareness and securing the trust and democratic involvement of our citizens .
For example , the definition of public authorities must include agencies and legal persons acting on behalf of the public authorities .
I think it is very important that there should be no commitment as regards the provision of information and no exceptions in relation to particularly important issues , such as gas emissions , discharges , dumping and other releases into the environment .
Finally , I should like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Korhola on her comprehensive report which will , I think , represent an important step towards active public involvement in dealing with environmental problems .
I think that he underestimates the matter ; we have a clear statement by Mr Cem on the prospect of incorporation and the threat of incorporation of the part of Cyprus occupied by the Turkish army as part of Turkey as we approach integration and I should like to ask the Commissioner , who spoke as if both sides had the same responsibilities : Cyprus , the Republic of Cyprus , is the first of all the candidate countries when it comes to chapters completed and approved .
Are both sides equally to blame ?
At the same time , it ignores the fact that 70 % of new power stations in the United States and 50 % in Japan use solid fuels , such as coal , because production is cheaper , even if initial investments are more costly .
At the same time , we are pressing for as many protective measures as it is possible to take .
It does , of course , take the use of modern information technologies into account but it also needs to take account of the fact that the number of requests will rise .
With all this unfinished business , it will be hard to apply the new legislation on "environmental information " .
Nor does anyone dispute the causes of this type of crime .
Instead , the French and Swedish initiatives on which the report is based propose creating a network so that Member States can exchange information on measures taken in this area .
