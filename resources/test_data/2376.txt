There are quite a few reasons why there are not enough women , and these apply everywhere .
As has been said , we are at present building the new Europe .
One of the places in which they can do this is , moreover , in the European Parliament .
Today , we are in a situation in which 30 % of Members of the European Parliament are women .
We are now enlarging the EU to include ten new countries and , in that connection , we are obliged to take a brief look at how women are represented in those countries .
Obviously , not all the countries are right at the bottom of the table , and the fact is that we also have , among the Member States , countries that are low down on the list where women’s representation is concerned .
What , therefore , we have to concentrate on in the forthcoming election is getting more women to stand and finding out why others do not wish to do so .
Personally , I believe it is the classic situation .
None of us are saints .
Gaining acceptance of EU cooperation will certainly take some doing .
Experience in the Scandinavian countries shows that it is not , therefore , a case of women not being elected .
If they stand on an equal footing , they are in actual fact elected .
The fact is that , if there are women who have any chance at all of being elected , then elected they are .
On the contrary , they are happy to vote for them .
It is extremely important that we discuss this matter now because , at present , 31 % of MEPs are women .
In a Parliament with greater influence upon European legislation than we have ever had before , we are thus now in danger of having far less than 30 % women , because women are so poorly represented in , for example , the new countries .
It really is unbelievable that democracy can be practised and human rights observed on that basis .
I was elected to Parliament as a representative of an all-party movement , the June Movement , which has now operated for ten years on the principle that we should draw half of all our parliamentary candidates and half of our party ’s leading members equally from both sexes .
For a long time , we had more men than we could make use of and only half the women we needed to have been elected .
We therefore began searching through our membership , and we finally obtained the list we wanted and needed .
The outcome would , however , have been a lopsided list if we had not adopted regulations committing ourselves to having a list divided equally between both sexes .
Some of the women did in fact obtain more votes at the party conference than some of the men but were listed beneath men with fewer votes because , according to our rule , every other person on the list must be a woman .
Women consistently hold back , even in those countries that are most advanced in terms of gender equality .
We also know this from job applications .
When women apply , qualifications have to be added .
If , as a result , qualified men were deselected in favour of less qualified women , I should not recommend the system , but , in the case of ourselves in the June Movement , the system has operated perfectly at each election , given women the necessary helping hand and provided us with a list that better reflects the electorate .
We have also made a conscious effort to get young candidates onto the list .
Nine of our candidates are under 40 years old and seven of them under 30 and , what is more , all of them are qualified .
Our youngest parliamentary candidate , who is only 18 , also has several years ’ experience of EU issues .
It is a pleasure to be able to contribute a success story from the real world to the debate on equality .
The other countries ’ editions just talk about equality rather than gender equality .     Basically , the June Movement believes that suspects and defendants in criminal proceedings should enjoy the greatest possible legal certainty .
The June Movement is naturally unable to support such an initiative .
I want to say to the Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats that it is puzzling , their having become interested in this proposal .
I therefore think we must say no .
We absolutely deplore the dreadful acts carried out by the terrorist groups , and we condemn them most vigorously .
I should like to use the GUE/NGL Group’s speaking time to talk about Eurostat , and I should like to make it quite clear that my group is not out to have the Prodi Commission dismissed because of Eurostat .
On the contrary , we should like to bring this matter to a close and give the Commission peace to do its work in its last year .
Unfortunately , the Eurostat scandal will hang like a cloud over the Commission until political responsibility for it has been assigned , so we should like to call upon Mr Prodi to dismiss the Commissioner responsible for Eurostat so that the Commission can be given peace to do its work .
It unfortunately confirms what we have known for a long time , namely that the administration of Eurostat has been scandalous .
There are no files , and most documents are missing .
We know there is a strong likelihood of a considerable amount of money having gone into the
