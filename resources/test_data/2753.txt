The exercise is pointless , because we know that internal reform decisions and external obligations under the WTO mean that agriculture policy is constantly subject to change and that the cost of our agricultural policy is far lower than was estimated , for example , at Edinburgh , as regards development of the so-called agricultural guideline .
I mentioned the Visegrad countries simply because one of the most hotly discussed reports quoting figures in the billions had to be do with enlargement to include the Visegrad countries , but you can take it from me that that implies no judgment on the Council 's part as to how the future process of enlargement will unfold and which countries will be involved .
I will leave it at that .
I can only repeat that the actions of judicial and police authorities within their own borders are a matter exclusively for the Member States .
This subject is on the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference .
Mrs Stenzel keeps wanting us to speculate about what the negotiating mandate of the European Commission will be in the accession talks .
So a dynamic process is unfolding on two sides .
I did indeed have a meeting with the representatives of organizations for the disabled .
So these are political comments by people who are entirely independent .
Since 1990 , as I said , there have been European Community measures under the responsibility of the Commission , designed to improve the lot of children in Romania and these measures have recently been intensified further .
Happily , I cannot recall any instance to date where a supreme judge in a national Member State prohibited the governments or citizens of that Member State from living by the rules of Community law .
But the parties still have a chance to comment on that report and perhaps on the basis of those comments the panel may change the report and the WTO disputes settlement procedure then gives a further opportunity of challenging any such verdict of the panel .
I am grateful to Mr Collins for understanding that the Council cannot say a great deal about structural policy after 1999 .
Do I gather that he is arguing in favour of using real purchasing power parities rather than gross national product as the basis for contributions to the European Union ?
It may well be helpful just for me to say that , in this confusing mixture .
Reducing CO2 emissions in the transport sector should not just be a matter of fine words , but be developed into a policy at European level .
As regards the standards themselves , both for cars and fuels , the Auto/Oil Programme is a disappointment .
First of all , the background level chosen for establishing permitted air pollution is much too low .
The same applies in principle to refining .
I think it must be quite clear that Parliament now has to take its stance , so that it has a definite position to fall back on when it comes to the second reading .
It does exist - people work together there , they reach clear judgements and these are now going to be put to the vote .
The employer as defendant has the relevant evidence and information , and often does not have to reveal it .
Who can have any objection to that , apart from Mr Cassidy ?
In this case , it is the Council which represents the fly in the ointment : while it is true that the Dutch presidency is doing its best to get this directive through the Council smoothly , it is also true that it is not having a great deal of success , and I should like Commissioner Flynn to bring us up to date on the state of the discussions in the Council .
I have to tell the House that in my days in the Second Chamber , as a member of a government party , I played a part with all the women in the government party and the opposition , and those in the trade unions , to bring a number of the cases mentioned here to a successful conclusion at the Court of Justice .
I should therefore like to hear from the Commission how the discussion in the Council is proceeding .
If I may add something to today 's debate , I should like to say that I was slightly annoyed by the doublespeak which has often dominated the discussions on the need for this directive , and which is then interpreted by the lobby - especially UNICE , but I have also heard it from a number of Members of the House - to the effect that not many people are happy with it .
I cannot understand this .
It is a hopeful sign that China has indicated that it intends to sign a number of international conventions , but it needs to do so as quickly as possible .
The Union must be ready to provide help , and our efforts are needed to promote security and stability in Eastern Europe .
Our debates now tend to be generated by whatever happen to be the interests of our constituencies , by those NGOs which are the best lobbyists , by our fascination for distant and unverifiable events , and of course by the decisive power that is wielded by the large political groups .
This is probably a historic moment for Zaire and possibly for the whole of Africa , and it is a great pity that our resolution is not pitched at the same level .
Mobutu 's army is pillaging its own people and refusing to fight , while Kabila 's army is advancing without resistance and should certainly reach the capital .
For the last 22 years , the authorities in Northern Cyprus
