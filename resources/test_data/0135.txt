this connection .
It does actually make a difference whether we measure emissions from a pipe or in a butterfly net a kilometre away .
One awkward question in this directive concerned the definition of an authority : do the rules apply to the authorities in the conventional sense or do they also include a body that has been delegated to carry out an official task , such as a company which maintains possession of information legally entrusted to it by virtue of an agreement it has made with an authority ?
When I have rejected amendments , I have done so mainly because of considerations of style .
Some members of the committee wanted to tighten up the time limits set for the authorities to respond .
I still consider this to be a realistic objective , although , in some cases , shortening the time limit might even have a negative effect on the quality of the response .
I do not therefore support the committee ' s proposals for a more stringent attitude .
The amendment I tabled in Article 8( 2 ) is based on the notion that the same standard should also apply to the EU institutions .
Mr President , I wish to join with the others in thanking the rapporteur in connection with this debate .
The rapporteur has now drafted a report that concerns the implementation of the first task of this Convention , which relates to the right of the public to have access to environmental information .
I myself was closely involved in the preparation of Mr Cashman' s report , and when I was familiarising myself with Mrs Korhola' s report I was wondering whether Mr Cashman' s report should not have a paragraph added to it stating that environmental and health-related information cannot be kept confidential even when it is classified as a trade secret .
It may be that a lot of environmental and health-related information will be withheld from the public if such a line is not drawn .
Question No 56 by (H-0219/01 ) : Subject : Impact of European Year of Languages on regional and minority languages 2001 is the European Year of Languages , which has just been officially inaugurated .
Mr President , this directive is important for the EU in terms of the environment , energy production and competitiveness .
The committee is imposing substantially stricter limits with no adequate differentiation being made with regard to their size and type .
In my own country , for example , this might mean a step backwards in ecological terms .
In Finland many different bodies share this concern , among others the Ministry of the Environment .
The latter process is carried out mainly in medium-size plants , which would now be treated in the same way as the large ones .
The report does not support this objective either , one which is directly linked to the matter of bio-fuels .
With its amendments , in search of compromise as they are , my own group is trying , among other things , to ensure that the combined production of heat and power in small and medium-sized power plants can continue , while the large plants are compelled to invest in technology that can adhere to stricter limit values .
We appreciate it very much that Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has agreed to these compromises .
We find ourselves once again in a situation where a legislator has to face the fact that different environmental conditions also mean different environmental effects .
We have therefore drawn up some very ambitious aims for limits on emissions by the year 2010 to present to Parliament .
I hope this position will prove successful tomorrow .
These interim targets should help us to get to a point at which areas where the critical acidification loads are exceeded will be halved , where the ozone load that affects health is reduced by two thirds , and where the ozone load in excess of critical levels for vegetation is reduced by a third .
Regrettably , these decisions will not , however , enable us to achieve the targets that were agreed in the Community ' s Acidification Strategy .
The proposal for a directive also contains the call for a review of the situation in 2004 .
The biggest threats , and thus the most challenging problem for the Member States , are emissions that result from energy production , and in this respect Mrs Oomen-Ruijten' s report , which has just been debated here , was a most important one , and I genuinely hope that in tomorrow ' s vote we can achieve the best possible results , as that will have a direct impact on how the emission ceilings this directive deals with can be achieved .
Member States therefore have to do something about it .
And lastly , I would like to say that the costs of this directive have been set too high in various connections .
If we take into account what was decided in the Kyoto Protocol , for example , we will get to a position where we can halve the proposed costs .
After some long and hard negotiations the Council achieved consensus on national emission ceilings .
It is perhaps not as ambitious as Parliament , in its first reading , would have liked , but perhaps it is the best possible compromise in this situation .
When emission limits were being discussed in Parliament ' s first reading in March of last year , I stressed that new targets should not be set before the earlier ones had been achieved .
The Commission must check that there is continued improvement in all Member States , and promote measures to help industry to make the necessary changes .
For that reason , Mrs Jackson ' s question is more than justified
