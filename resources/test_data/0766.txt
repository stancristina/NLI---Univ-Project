Could not Paragraph 15 be understood as saying , 'Adapt , full stop .
Thank you for your answer .
In what way is the European Union taking action against all those Arab and Muslim countries - in practice , almost all of them - in which converting from Islam to Christianity is in actual fact punishable by death ?
Madam President , Commissioner , I want to begin by thanking the rapporteur , Mrs Langenhagen , for her work on the report .
We have also seen how technology is changing all the time and creating new aids and how companies are forever developing new products to be used within different areas of society .
There is a space industry in various parts of Europe today , for example in northernmost Sweden , and I think it important that we should use existing infrastructure to keep down the future costs of this project .
Major technical breakthroughs have more often than not taken place following development using research supported by the public sector , often with a view to the research ' s being used for military purposes .
What is unique about GALILEO , unlike the GPS system , is that it is being developed for civil rather than military purposes .
Clearly , however , we have embarked upon a very interesting discussion of trade marks and their significance in terms of dividing up world markets .
The Commission takes a relatively negative view of international exhaustion in its study .
I also hope that the Commissioner can tell us what opportunities there are for addressing the issue in the context of the WTO in which a new round of talks is about to start .
In terms of the long view politically and economically , we may also be able to establish a better legal system with a stronger UN.
In Ghent , enlargement will also be discussed .
However , there is still a certain amount of concern in this area .
The UN , NATO and the EU have acted vigorously in this common struggle .
Do not let the prevailing mood be exploited for the purpose of closing borders or increasing prejudices between people .
Madam President-in-Office of the Council , make sure that Ghent is used to strengthen the EU' s ability to promote the open society .
It is therefore also foolhardy of the Belgian Presidency to play the anti-globalisation game by bringing up the Tobin Tax , which would directly counteract economic recovery and increased trade .
We are particularly critical of Paragraph 15 , which states that 'immigrants are expected to respect the community of values - as set out in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights - and to show a willingness to integrate into society in the Member States ' .
In Sweden and in several other Member States , Muslims have been harassed .
This standard would guarantee a situation in which all consumers knew what applied and one in which they had the confidence to acquire the necessary equipment .
The Commission does not support this decision , and the Council has entirely ignored the issue , which I believe is of immense importance if we are to achieve what is known as Digital Update and promote digital technology in all TV markets .
There is also a special set of problems in this context .
This is entirely unacceptable in such cases and in breach of normal legal practice .
Was this pure coincidence ?
In Paragraph 1 of the European Parliament resolution of 5 July 2001 on the EU positions at the UN General Assembly Special Session on Children , we state the following : 'family is the fundamental unit of society and holds the primary responsibility for the protection , upbringing and development of children ' .
Why has the EU acted in a way which means that the concept of family has in fact been changed ?
I asked specific questions about the concept of family .
I am assuming that this will be the last time you offend a Member in this way .
I am very glad that the European Parliament is now about to take a decision on supporting the Commission ' s proposed strategy for creating an internal market for services .
We cannot continue with sectoral regulation of services , something which has so far proved to hinder , rather than facilitate , the creation of an internal market .
It is also important that the candidate countries should be involved as soon as possible .
Without political will at all levels , the goal cannot be achieved .
Lack of funds , especially in the area of research , has long been acute .
The resolution should be seen in the context of the work we are currently carrying out with regard to the budget for next year , in which we propose , at least on a preliminary basis , considerable increases compared with the proposals of the Commission and the Council .
More resources are needed , but there is also a need for new and innovative forms of partnership - especially between the public and private sectors .
.
The European Parliament has been forced into rushed action without any reports , debate or access to the text of the legislation in many languages , including Swedish .
The regulation contains no definition of terrorism , terrorists or terror organisations whatsoever .
In addition , all the names on the list are easily identifiable as Arabic/Muslim .
In this way , the Commission would have been able to return with a new proposal which would have genuinely increased the chances of fighting terrorism , would have been based on legal principles and would have ruled out any suspicion that the proposal is one-sidedly directed against the Arabic/Muslim world .
