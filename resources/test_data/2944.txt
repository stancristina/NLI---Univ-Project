governments .
The proposal does not even require a change to the Treaty .
It can be implemented by means of a simple change to the Rules of Procedure .
Come on now , Mr Barroso and Mr Schüssel , get matters under way so that people might feel respect for the necessary cross-border cooperation .     Mr President , I should like to thank the rapporteur for an excellent report that lays down important principles .
Bilateral agreements always benefit the stronger party .
Secondly , the report states that the EU must show leadership .
We must get away from the quid-pro-quo principle and not focus on what we in the EU can get out of agreements in the short term .
Then there is agriculture .
According to the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) , such arrangements are very problematic for the world’s poor .
Finally , I want to say how gratifying it is that the report alludes to the ILO and environmental standards , even though it does so in unduly broad terms .     – The free movement of workers is one of the cornerstones of European cooperation .
The temporary transitional arrangements that a number of countries – including my own , Denmark – have chosen to introduce in relation to Eastern European workers must be cancelled as quickly as is reasonably possible .
The rules must therefore be made flexible so that all unnecessary barriers are removed .
The transitional rules in Denmark serve as protection against exploitation and ensure that workers receive the wages provided for by collective agreements .
We have a responsibility to defend workers ’ freedom of movement , which is a fundamental right in the EU.
The transitional conditions were , and are , an attempt to attend simultaneously to both considerations .
The transitional rules have therefore made it possible to monitor the influx of workers from Eastern Europe so that efforts could be concentrated on those employers who have tried to circumvent the rules governing wages and working conditions .
However , there are huge problems with applying the rules in practice .
People are unaware of their rights , companies do not know which rules they have to follow and public authorities interpret the directive differently from one another .
Rather than amend the directive , we therefore have a great deal to do in terms of better administration and the better provision of information .
In that way we should be able seriously to reap the benefits of an internal market for services .
Every shepherd has to keep track of every sheep , but no EU institution knows precisely how many laws we have .
The state of the law governing , for example , the fisheries area is to be sought in more than 70 different regulations .
In that way , citizens themselves will be able to see and read the resultant act , which is the first precondition for their having influence .
In that way , everyone will be able to see what the aim of the proposal is .
Under these arrangements , EU laws would be able to authorise the issue of notifications , but any such instrument could be reconsidered on the basis of a straightforward majority in the Council and Parliament .
All committee procedures in which a minority combines with the Commission to legislate against the majority in the national parliaments and the European Parliament should also be abolished .
It is absurd that the Commission should have been able to approve genetically modified cornflakes when , their citizens having discovered what had really been decided behind closed doors , 14 out of 15 countries were opposed to such approval and country number 15 also came out in opposition .
The European Parliament’s work must be transparent and clearly formulated , and we must , in particular , remove the administrative barriers in European legislation .
At the same time , we must prioritise legal certainty and predictability for our citizens and not let the authorities or the European Court of Justice have too much discretion .
However , the Court is merely doing its job , because we legislators are not doing our own sufficiently well .
This is an area in which we must all do better at second reading .     Mr President , I shall begin by thanking Parliament’s rapporteur , Mrs Doyle , who has done a sterling piece of work on this matter .
On behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe I should like to offer my sincere thanks for the constructive cooperation .
Consideration has been given to countries such as Denmark and Austria , which have taken the ban on fluorinated gases further , and other countries can follow their lead .
This proves that the EU puts the environment before everything else .
When , tomorrow , the European Parliament adopts the conciliation committee’s document by what I hope will be a very large majority , I assume that Environment Commissioner Mr Dimas will take the opportunity to withdraw the Commission ’s letter of formal notice addressed to Denmark .
Now that the Community legislation has been changed , there will be no basis for taking legal proceedings against Denmark at the European Court of Justice .
Allow me to remind the Commission that it would be quite unprecedented and completely unacceptable if the new Community legislation were not administered by the Commission .
The Council and the European Parliament have approved the agreement and the content of the conciliation document .
I would therefore ask you , Commissioner , to withdraw the letter of formal notice addressed to Denmark following tomorrow’s vote when a large majority of Parliament has voted in favour of the document .
The Commission will thus be a party to the compromise reached between the Council and Parliament in the conciliation procedure
