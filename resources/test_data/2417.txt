president of the High Transitional Authority .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the same is happening in Madagascar as in numerous other countries around the world , towards which the European Union has demonstrated a lack of political power .
We are very worried because , rather than making progress , we are slipping backwards and there is a clear risk of returning to where we started in March 2009 .
There are 2 000 registered political prisoners , including over 230 Buddhist monks who took part in peaceful demonstrations in September 2008 and who have been in prison ever since .
Now I would like to come to the substance of the debates of 11 February , which is , of course , the 2020 strategy , but it is also the euro and economic and budgetary policy , since speculation against the Greek debt and the euro were certainly unexpected guests in the Solvay library .
However , because it is still divided , Europe is unable to punch its full weight .
I would like to use a language that also reflects what is positive about the European Union , because surprising though it may seem , there are also positive things that have happened recently .
We must improve it , and Mr Monti will provide us with some concrete proposals .
It is not by chance - and I have repeated this in the written conclusions that you have read - that we want to link the budgetary discussion , effectively in its legal framework of the Stability and Growth Pact , to economic reforms .
As for the economic strategy , it is all very well for some to say that we need more constraints .
This crisis was also a challenge , a challenge in the sense that we must practise the policy of coordination more .
However , there has been the Goldstone report .
Indeed , as Commissioner for Fundamental Rights , I think that the subject of fundamental rights linked to equal treatment between men and women is one of the most important and also one of the oldest .
That was the signal sent out in Beijing .
Mr President , on my return from New York , I will visit you to discuss the Commission 's strategy on equality .
The implementation of the Platform for Action falls under the sovereign responsibility of each Member State , taking into account and showing strict respect for diverse religious and ethical values , and for the cultural heritage and philosophical convictions of individuals and their communities .
Had the implementation of the Beijing Platform respected these premises , we would not have observed just a slight improvement in the situation of women .
The European Rail Traffic Management System ( ERTMS ) does , in fact , offer companies an opportunity to invest in safety in a coordinated and interoperable manner .
The main factor in the lack of safety across Europe 's rail networks is a direct consequence of the separation between the management of our rail infrastructure and the management of our rolling stock .
Even though they are used regularly , some lines are being taken out of service because they are not profitable enough .
This is a provocation .
In the marble of the European Parliament and the Council of Europe buildings , we have engraved the leitmotif of 17 October - the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty : ' Wherever men and women are condemned to live in poverty , human rights are violated .
It is true to say that Greece has not always been as rigorous as it should have been in the management of its public accounts and EU funds .
I voted against Mrs Patrão Neves 's report because it rejects the amendments intended to establish a balance between environmental interests and the preservation of small-scale fisheries .
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance estimates that it would be difficult to significantly raise the taxes paid by small businesses , which create the majority of jobs .
That situation would not , of course , be perfect and there would be obstacles to circumvent .
I am also mindful of the preliminary work that was carried out and of Mrs Berès ' and Mr Gauzès ' extremely positive and interesting reports on matters relating to SEPA.
This issue must , of course , be analysed on the basis of its compatibility with competition policy , for which my colleague , Mr Almunia , is responsible .
That is why there has been a joint initiative with the European Central Bank to create a SEPA council that brings together a limited number of high-level representatives of the payments industry and users .
Another purpose of the directive was to improve competition in the area of payments , and Title II made provision for the creation of payment institutions , which were intended to break the monopoly of the banks .
I will carry out this brief consultation - on this subject and on others relating to the proper implementation of SEPA - and then I will take the decisions quickly , as Mrs Bowles has asked .
So , here we are .
Thirdly , contrary to what may have been said , this proposal does not necessarily involve completely exempting micro-entities of all accounting requirements .
Accounting rules will then be imposed on them and they may have to pay a higher price than they would for ordinary accounting in order to satisfy criteria that they will not necessarily overcome .
I think - as Mr Lehne said - that we need this operational sign .
I clearly heard Mrs Castex mention the other prospect : the commitment to carry out a future general review of the accounting directives .
We will see what we can do about that with the Council .
