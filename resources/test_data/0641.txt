European culture at its best and high quality food always has its own price .
It is part of a general endeavour to improve air quality throughout the European Union .
I hope the Council of Ministers will also take Parliament 's position seriously .
There must be diversity in the range of rural occupations , and the countryside has to be developed with respect for nature and recreation .
The right to roam the countryside must in no case be connected to rights of ownership , and public right of access must be secured .
Agricultural policy demands reform .
It has to be said that the views of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and those of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection are reasonably close to one another here .
Under this principle , linking environmental standards to the payment of aid cannot be left up to individual Member States .
Aid should be paid only to farmers who comply with the agreed rules .
Applying a code of good agricultural practice must be made more effective by being able to claim back our resources .
It is vital that the question of diversity in the European Union is taken into consideration , as agriculture is practised from the north to the south .
At this time of the year there might be a metre of snow and the temperature could be thirty degrees below zero .
It will be a tough job , and the fear that the special conditions prevailing in peripheral areas will be ignored in the final decisions that are taken is a very legitimate one .
At the same time the Commission is proposing that only half the reduction in the administrative price should be paid back in compensation .
Rural Europe will need viable agriculture in the future to preserve its vitality and diversity .
Agricultural development will continue to affect the well-being of the entire population of the continent .
Agriculture has to move in step with the liberalising world market , but we must be able to impose a change in direction and speed .
If we can put our trust in the future of European agricultural production and unanimously take the necessary decisions , Europe will have a vital , diverse food and agriculture industry for the next millennium .
But as far as deducting VAT is concerned , we actually think the Commission 's proposal is more sensible than what the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy is proposing .
The hotel and catering sector has obviously appealed to the parliamentary groups that business travel hotel and restaurant expenses should be deductible in full , but , in our opinion , that is not reasonable because of the possible dual nature of the expenses , as I said .
However , the hotel and catering sector in itself is vital for employment and Member States should now be able to experiment with lowering VAT to give support to employment in these areas .
It is quite clear that jobs in the future will be created ultimately in service industries and the hotel and catering sector is an important example of this , but it would be a mistake if business travel costs were made entirely VAT-exempt .
It is a matter of information , which is refined into data , then perception and realisation , and finally culture and education : information is only a raw material .
Content is the area where the European Union has fallen behind , compared with its competitors .
People can in practice enjoy content in an infinite number of ways .
I support the Commission 's initiative for international action and a charter for the Internet and electronic commerce .
A crime is a crime on the Internet too , and that we must be aware of .
Obviously , there must be cooperation .
It is a modern European Union 's civil right and we will hold on to it .
Mr President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , commercial communications should certainly be broadened further .
They are a source of employment and are going through immense changes .
Commercial communications are becoming increasingly image-orientated .
Today advertising creates society 's opinions .
The drink is no longer advertised as a drink in itself , especially on television , but the lifestyle that goes with it is : youth , beaches , freedom and beauty .
Problems are caused by advertising which is targeted at children and others who are vulnerable .
We have to protect the weak .
Similarly , sports sponsorship and its sometimes negative associations , including the business of the Olympics , show what can happen when there is inadequate control and a criminally-inclined element .
Good , flexible advertising is therefore an important goal .
I do not believe , however , that that would be a satisfactory approach .
It is in accordance with Finnish interests that a properly functioning Commission continues to maintain the balance of power between the large Member States and the smaller countries in the final round of the Agenda 2000 talks , in which our country has important national interests to protect .
We nevertheless regard it as vital that the Commission should embark on measures , as requested by Parliament , to improve the administration of its finances and clarify individual responsibilities within the Commission .
However , it should be emphasised that the suspicions of fraud , mismanagement and maladministration that surround the Commission provide grounds for justified and heavy criticism .
In view of the above we considered that it would be best for us to abstain in the vote on the censure motion .
I voted in favour of the Commission in today 's vote on the motion of censure .
The lack of confidence will not improve if the Commission resigns
