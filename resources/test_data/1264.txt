I support the Charter .
I have also worked on it in relation to the Danish constitution and must say that it is rather better and more forward-looking than , for example , that particular constitution read only as it stands and without the whole historical background .
I therefore think it good to be able to look at whether some articles are more important and more significant than others and at whether there are matters it might not be thought crucial to incorporate at this stage .
Mr President , the subject of the report is ostensibly the effect of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights .
One looks in vain to the report , however , for a serious discussion of this legally and politically quite crucial issue .
First of all , why do we need an EU Charter at all when we have the European Convention on Human Rights , endorsed by all the EU Member States ?
By making a simple treaty change , the EU should , however , endorse the treaty as a matter of course , and that is something also recommended in the report .
The report 's talk of smooth cooperation is sheer nonsense , legally speaking .
The Charter is purely and simply a building block for an EU federal state .
As is apparent from , for example , paragraphs 7 , P , X and N , the citizens of the European Union are being subjected to the EU 's federal authorities .
Mr President , there is no doubt that , for many countries , the easiest solution would be to incorporate the Charter with reference to Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union .
That would presumably be the easiest solution for my own country too .
I therefore think that the maximum solution should be chosen whereby the EU is endowed with legal personality and accedes to the Convention of Human Rights , for this solution would give the Court of Human Rights more authority in relation to the EC Court of Justice .
I should perhaps have liked to have seen the rapporteur insert just one simple clause to the effect that we must bear this concern in mind , for if we in actual fact listen to the legitimate concern the Member States may have and , at the same time , opt for the maximum solution , I think we shall succeed in combining the broad vision with the facts .
Mr President , three years ago , the Tampere European Council gave the initial impetus to a common European asylum and immigration policy .
That was the point of departure .
Those of us in the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party are satisfied that our attitudes have been taken into account in the work of the committee .
It is important that we obtain common minimum standards for refugees .
If the rules are to be effective , it is also important for all the Member States to have a common definition of what a refugee is .
I am pleased that the report contains general rules for determining whether or not international protection is properly justified .
Each year , a large number of illegitimate asylum seekers enter the EU.
Illegal immigration and people smuggling must be combated , but genuine refugees must be helped .
An important prerequisite of its being possible to put this proposal into practice is that we obtain a common definition of refugees with subsidiary protection status .
I support making the concept of subsidiary protection status a part of the common refugee policy .
It is important for third country nationals to be given the opportunity of making headway with their lives in their new countries .
For example , Denmark and Sweden have set to work on active integration policies .
The proposal has elements relating to common rights for third country nationals with legal residence in the EU , and these rights must form the basis of a sensible and necessary integration policy .
Overall , the report takes a balanced view of the problems with which we are confronted , and I hope that it will be able to attract a broad majority in Parliament .
- ( DA ) We have today voted in favour of Mrs Lambert 's report because , in many areas , it improves upon the minimum standards that , under the auspices of the EU , an attempt is now unfortunately being made to establish when it comes to refugees and persons with subsidiary refugee status .
For example , the Commission 's proposal relates exclusively to third country nationals and stateless persons , while EU citizens are not covered by it .
Moreover , the Commission proposes that persons with refugee status must have more extensive rights .
The June Movement is in favour of a humane refugee policy .
We agree that the EU should lay down minimum standards for the recognition of third country nationals and stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection .
We are nonetheless aware of the fact that the directive is covered by Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community and does not apply to Denmark , cf . the protocol on Denmark 's position .
Two agencies have the problem of being physically situated in countries where the rate of inflation is higher than the EU average , and this erodes their budgets and , therefore , their ability to carry out their tasks .
The other agency is that in Turin which develops vocational training in the Balkans and within the framework of the MEDA and TACIS programmes .
The agencies differ greatly from one another in the ways in which they are set up and in the tasks they have , and I therefore hope that ,
