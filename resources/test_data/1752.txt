term .
In this connection , I myself would like to comment just on the relevant production markets and the guidelines for interpretation regarding how market share is determined , especially from the point of view of cooperation agreements in the petrol station business .
Regarding cooperation agreements in the petrol station business , the draft guidelines to be applied do not at present take sufficiently clear account of the special features of that industry ' s market and delivery agreements .
It is important to define unambiguously the relevant markets referred to in Article 3 of the Block Exemption regulation .
The guidelines have not defined sufficiently precisely how the market share of a manufacturer and a wholesaler should be determined .
As this is a matter of regulating the right of competition in an industry in which competition takes place among brand names , the guidelines should clearly state that calculating market shares should always involve studying each stage of delivery separately .
Madam President , first I would like to express my deepest regret that we are debating a review of the financial perspective , and we have not even been presented with an initial written document .
The only way we can bear the costs of war and its consequences would seem to be at the expense of agriculture .
Mr President , firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Hatzidakis , for his excellent report .
Our Group supports him , for example , on the issue of coordinating regional and private funding in the Member States of the Union .
We need more precise accounts of inter alia how the European Regional Development Fund , the Cohesion Fund , funds from financial sources not included in the Union budget and funds from the Member States are spent to improve trans-European transport networks .
In addition , the Essen projects have devoured a larger proportion of the Union ' s funding for transport than was agreed .
The Annual Report shows that more money is also needed for the development of transport and traffic safety through the Union budget , since transport communications are so vital for the economy , employment and , furthermore , for social cohesion .
In the future we shall have to pay more attention to the coordination of various forms of transport .
Balanced regional development can help to slow down the trend towards centralisation and reduce traffic congestion .
I somewhat doubt whether any lengthy interview process was involved in filling the post in which Mr Levi did so very well .
It is quite right that we should aim to move away from national quotas , but that should not mean we should have a hidden criterion that actually favours the notion of representatives of large Member States and major language groups in senior positions .
We must realise this .
Commissioner Kinnock faithfully made a list of the Commission ' s senior appointments and promotions , but , Commissioner , you did not say how many women were nominated for , or promoted to , these posts .
Mr President , Commissioner , representatives of the Council , I had to hurry when I noticed my electronic gadgetry up there in my office on the twelfth floor was telling me the list of speakers was being worked through at a rate of knots .
Hopefully , however , it will not have an effect on the matter in hand .
Stressing the importance of the review clause is only prudent in such urgent legislative plans as these .
I am satisfied that , as in the directive on electronic money for which I was rapporteur , a review clause is to be included .
It is pointless to deny that a veritable race is going on between the various continents in the area of electronic commerce .
New jobs will be created where the new technology is first introduced .
Wisdom is not always a characteristic of politicians , be they in the Commission , the Council , or in this Chamber .
To derive maximum benefit from e-commerce we have to ensure there is real competition in the telecommunications networks .
Like Mrs Niebler , I would also like to thank Mr Liikanen , and express my gratitude for the work the Commission has done with such determination in this area .
If we just sit here talking about details , we will not manage to lay down even elementary up-to-date standards for electronic commerce .
When we talk of transitional economies we might ask where these economies are really going .
One tenth of its GNP goes on a bill from just one Russian company , Gazprom , which - as the previous speaker said - is switching out the lights in the state of Moldova .
There is therefore a stranglehold on energy that does not just affect Moldova but also its neighbour , Ukraine ; and Belarus , too , for that matter .
Moldova ' s need for finance will be huge in the years to come .
The basic pension is just one fifth of the heating costs of one small flat .
As has been said , Russian troops are in the region of Trans-Dnestr , Lebed ' s famous 14th army , not all of it , but nonetheless it has some influence .
The next zone of enlargement , the following zone of candidate countries , will be the one we shall have to concentrate on .
We have to create an area of special action , of which Moldova will be a part , and we have to help them .
Our Group supports the rapporteur ' s views .
The country ' s economy has shrunk by around two thirds in the last ten years alone .
It will be extremely hard for Moldova to overcome its huge problems without foreign assistance
