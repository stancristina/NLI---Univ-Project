Mr President , I absolutely agree with what my co-chairman , Mr Pasty , said a few moments ago , and I want to be just as firm in what I have to say about the future reform of the Structural Funds and the proposals today put forward by the Commission .
Indeed , cutting the number of objectives from six to three , with only two of those being regional , and completely reducing the number of zones currently eligible , seems to me to be difficult in practice , as it is not clear to me how this is to be done .
It is certainly no easy matter and very questionable to bring in countries such as Slovenia which , in my view , did not deserve to be included , while leaving out others .
We also consider it vital that an ethical committee should be set up to assess all aspects relating to biotechnology and its use , and that it is at the same time necessary that , every five years as of the entry into force of the directive , scheduled for 1 January 1999 , the Commission should publish a report illustrating all of the problems encountered in the implementation of the directive in relation to the international agreements on the protection of human rights to which the Member States have acceded .
Anyway , I am going to make a point that has an international implication , taking my cue from what happened at the recent NATO summit in Madrid , during which it was decided to extend that military organization to bring in Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic , to demonstrate that Europe is still lacking a common European security policy .
We welcome the fact that all of the political forces accepted the outcome , but it is also true that , had the election result been different , had it been the democratic party and not the socialist party that had won , then the attitude of the defeated party might well have been different .
We need therefore to request the United Nations to extend the mandate of the multinational force , giving it a new format and extending it to include other countries .
We hope , at any rate , that Albania will be able to emerge from the tunnel in which it finds itself and that events in Albania will give Europe the impetus to establish as rapidly as possible a common foreign and security policy , so that we do not once again find ourselves unprepared and tragically lagging behind in the face of various crisis points simmering on our doorstep.
I have to say to the President-in-Office that Europe proved ineffective here .
The presence of the multinational force and the contribution made to the OSCE initiative were two crucial factors that ought not to be forgotten .
We do not want to see a repetition of what happened in the past !
This is the real message of our debates this afternoon .
I would have said this irrespective of which Member or political grouping was under attack .
Second : the assumption by the Commission , rather than delegation to outside firms , of direct control of invitations to tender and project implementation , with its own staff , using efficient , modern monitoring systems , as the Commission is indeed capable of doing .
The Court of Auditors rightly noted breaches and irregularities in procedures , but , as I have already stated before the Committee on Regional Policy , it would have done better to draw the matter to the Commission 's attention in the appropriate way before reaching the point of sanctioning breaches of procedures and other irregularities - this being in the spirit of the European Union and hence according to a kind of theory of communicating vessels .
I have always insisted that the Commission should not take on a single official more than necessary , that it should be rigorous , that even the engagement of category C officials should be monitored .
Mr President , Commissioner , colleagues , first I should like to compliment Mr Fabra on his excellent report , and , I must add , the Court of Auditors on its excellent auditing work , which I hope will be carried out in the same way , just as rigorously , in the other sectors as well , particularly as regards work contracted out : frankly , I find it difficult to believe that it is only in the MED programmes that intrigues and irregularities occur .
Mr President , our group supports the main thrust of Mr Rosado Fernandes 's report , but above all agrees with the Commission 's document .
I do not think that would be very responsible .
Certainly , if we had a solid rural policy in the Community today , we would already have gone a long way , not least for tobacco growers .
Let us consider the problem of employment : employees number not just 300 , 000 , but 1 , 420 , 000 if both direct employment and ancillary jobs are taken into account : 11 per cent in Greece , 9 per cent in Italy ; 80 per cent are women ; and all , let us remember , in areas which are regarded as less favoured .
Today the Committee on Agriculture is proposing the adoption of the following quality promotion measures : 1.modulation of premia should be 20-25 per cent at the outside ; 2. the rebate of approximately 2 per cent from premia should fund research into improving the quality of known varieties ; 3 . specific measures need to be taken towards defining the concept of quality through the setting up of an independent body .Any attempt to persuade tobacco farmers to leave the business should , therefore , be rejected , as there are no surpluses
