an example from my own country .
This is probably the most important point in the whole report .
To put it rather dramatically , this decision means that my region can come back to life and that forestry , the fishing industry and biodiversity will be given a chance to repair the damage which has occurred over decades and perhaps even a whole century .
I look forward to the review which is to be carried out , as I know that such measures are insufficient .
Madam President , I want to thank the committee and its chairman for a well-considered report .
On many occasions , I have felt depressed by quite a few of the proposals from the Member States and the Commission whose main aim seems to have been to stop , impede , deport and expel .
It is certainly true that common asylum rules are needed within the EU , but there also needs to be scope for individual Member States to make more generous assessments .
The committee has guaranteed this scope .
I am nonetheless a little uneasy about the Council ' s future handling of these issues .
It is not countries such as Nauru that can be expected to assume responsibility for people fleeing from barbaric regimes such as that in Afghanistan .
Any State can potentially infringe human rights , and no country can therefore automatically be regarded as safe .
It is extremely important that we together affirm the principles under the Geneva Convention whereby everyone is entitled to have his case examined individually .
Female genital mutilation causes irreparable damage to health and can even lead to death .
Female genital mutilation is an assault on the rights of women and children as enshrined in several international conventions and is prohibited in the criminal legislation of the Member States .
We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions are to be taken as close as possible to those whom they affect .
We do not , however , believe that measures to combat this problem are best taken at EU level .
Some people find low-frequency noise and its vibrations very unpleasant .
I am convinced that we need more research into the problem of noise , and more knowledge about it .
The level of settlement varies according to whether we are talking about heavily populated areas in Central Europe , such as in the Netherlands , or sparsely populated areas in northern Europe such as are to be found in Sweden and Finland .
However , industrial areas and airports are fixed installations , and their environments vary considerably .
We must comply with the principle of subsidiarity and draw up anti-noise regulations that it is possible to apply throughout the EU without there being unreasonable local consequences .
We have a basis for achieving a rapid and effective agreement .
The proposal we are discussing today concerns emissions from engines used in lawn mowers , power saws , leaf collection machines , pumps , generators and similar equipment .
Obviously , we must do something about the emissions from machines of this type .
We consider that this legislation effectively satisfies the environmental requirements , and it has also been a big influence on the way in which our proposal is designed .
We have therefore proposed certain special rules exempting these products and companies , and these are the same types of exemption found in the American legislation .
The Commission is also opposed to changing the definition of small manufacturers .
In this context , it is important , if the necessary environmental impact is to be achieved , not to exempt products which in reality could meet the requirements .
The Commission therefore wishes to emphasise the importance of retaining this instrument as a part of the legislation and opposes the amendments in question .
At the same time , I wish to emphasise that what is essential is not the averaging and banking system as such but bringing about the flexibility , harmonisation and environmental benefits provided by the system .
We also oppose amendments that exclude the use of two-stroke engines for generators and snow-blowers .
The Commission is not able to accept Amendments 4 , 5 , 9 , 16 and 29 .
There is little confidence in the European institutions , and the individual citizen can feel that the gap between 'those in Brussels ' and 'those of us at home ' is extremely large .
We are very well disposed towards the start made by the White Paper .
The new rules adopted earlier this year in accordance with Article 255 are a first step on the way .
There is little that is very specific in the White Paper , however .
We are aware that many of Mr Kinnock ' s proposed reforms have come up against pretty formidable resistance .
I hope that many will feel prompted to respond and present their views before part two appears .
Thank you for this first part of the White Paper .
Not everything has to be included , but just those things that cannot better be taken care of at national , local or individual levels , such as the internal market , the common currency , external and internal security , borders , customs and certain environmental issues .
The objectives need to be clarified and the initiatives adapted accordingly .
It is necessary to be able to hold people to account in a democratic system governed by law , and the prerequisite for this is a common basis of values with clear guidelines .
Cooperation with civil society can make political measures better suited to their purpose , but the role of politicians must be clearly distinguished from civil society .
Can people be held to account ?
In several EU countries , Muslims have been persecuted
