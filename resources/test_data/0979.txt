prison .
We are entitled to expect them not to be punished for serving in Kosovo of their volition .
In other words , millions and billions are promised and announced but only a relatively small proportion of this sees the light of day .
Then after the initial confusion the Chechens issued a clear denial .
When I read that assertions are being made to the effect that this is a conspiracy on the part of their Hungarian neighbours , I realise that now is the time for the European Parliament to make it clear to Romania in no uncertain terms that this is not the way we want to behave towards each other in Europe , or how we want to solve problems .
We are still awaiting a communication from the Commission on this .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Viceconte ' s report is a very good piece of work in my view and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur warmly on it .
It is extremely important , in this respect , to make the sustainability of measures and the protection of natural habitats in our environment our guiding principles .
In my country , Austria , tourism and the leisure industry are of central importance to the national economy , contributing as they do to income and job security , as well as to the balance of payments .
Tourism simply does not feature in most national action plans for the transposition of our common European employment strategy .
Multilingualism and a capacity for empathy with foreign cultures will enable people to gain a better understanding of our Community .
We do not have to adhere to a weight of over 300g when the analysis shows that we need to ensure a minimum weight of 150g to make it at all worthwhile .
We should take a look - thinking also of benchmarking - at what the consumer currently pays for an employee in the existing postal services and what he pays for an employee in the private sector .
That will develop very quickly and present the various undertakings in our society with new challenges ; we will have to adapt very flexibly and rapidly to these challenges .
I am most grateful to the Commissioner for his plain talking today and I would ask the Commission to force the pace now .
For if there is only one letter box left in the inner city of Munich where the mail is collected again in the evening , that reflects a rapid decline in quality , while at the same time prices are sometimes rising , which is something else we must note .
The question of transitional periods is worrying us .
This goes against all the rhetoric we are hearing these days .
For only if we pull together within the European Union and live in harmony will we also be able to set an example for peace and the peaceful resolution of conflicts outside the European Union .
If you allocate 0.7 % of national budgets for military armaments , then I wonder if it would not make a great deal more sense to earmark 10 % of the EU budget for conflict prevention .
The debate is also interesting because it is about the relationship between the Prime Minister and the President .
Firstly : to what extent are you able to influence the professionalism of the Council ' s decisions ?
It is all well and good , and touching , when we wring our hands over the mass graves and the refugees .
They did not follow the Council recommendation of 1996 on equal involvement for women and overcoming the under-representation of women .
Women' s policy should not be formulated in such a way that it is as if women are working against men , rather women and men must join forces in order to seek and arrive at socio-political solutions .
Is it down to the European Central Bank ?
First and foremost , there is the flexibility of labour markets .
I am certainly not overly pessimistic with regard to the prospects for the European Union .
It should not boil down to a renationalisation of the fight against inflation at Member State level , this fight being waged due to the pressure exerted by increased oil and raw materials prices .
And the tax revenue from top earners did not fall when this reduction took place , rather the reverse happened .
This would include a benchmarking procedure , with the exchange of comparable data and a shift of emphasis from action plans to the fight against exclusion and poverty .
That is what the debate we are having is all about , on the subject of which I have this to say to you : we need more freedom and less state intervention .
And of course we want to afford women opportunities on the labour market .
There is sound evidence as to the accuracy of this theory .
Several Articles and proposed amendments refer to the difficulties that have not yet been resolved .
On the other hand , we support your proposal to the effect that more precise statistics should be collected on the employment situation .
I wholeheartedly endorse these amendments .
Mr President , Mr Fischler , concerning the Attwooll report , I have just this minute had an impromptu discussion with your assistant about the database , and I welcome this kind of cooperation with open arms .
The only way to achieve this is by efficient monitoring , strict observance of regulations , applying the "polluter pays " principle ( eventually ) , and using sanctions that hurt .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , one thing must be made clear , to my mind : it is the task of our common fisheries policy to guarantee sustainable fisheries management .
