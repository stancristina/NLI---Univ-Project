I also call on the Presidency to solve this dilemma soon , without unnecessary delay , using the famous Finnish common sense , and not stubbornness this time .     – Mr President , three minutes is a wonderfully long time .
One of them is in favour of autonomy , the other is in favour of independence .
Therefore I feel very strongly that we should stick to the timetable and time limits envisaged by the contact group and have the issue settled by the end of the Finnish Presidency at the end of 2006 .
The second point I wanted to make is that , much like Mr Posselt , I see no option other than independence , with some limitations on Kosovo’s sovereignty , of course .
I do not think we should repeat the mistakes of the past , and in that sense we must stand very firm in supporting the UN Special Envoy , Martti Ahtisaari , whom I feel is doing an excellent job .
I certainly hope that the Finnish Presidency in 2006 will end with a final settlement on the Kosovo issue and with independence for Kosovo .     – Madam President , reports about Kosovo describe the province as having become ghettoised .
One main reason for why standards have not been achieved , despite the massive input that there has been , is that Kosovo is one of the main havens for organised crime in Europe .
International human trafficking and the trade in territory and weapons are rampant in Kosovo .
Now the global actors involved in the programme , however , have much too little time and too few staff for their many areas of responsibility .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , a status solution is the best option for Kosovo and for that reason we should support the efforts of UN Special Envoy Ahtisaari to find one , using all possible means .
Apart from anything else , the European Union is preparing for a huge civil crisis management operation in Kosovo .
The work of the Planning Team is as yet unfinished , but the intention is for their report to be in the hands of the Council’s working group at the end of the month .
Preparations are thus making headway in many different ways and in many different sectors , but we can surely improve their steady flow .
The Presidency is very committed to finding a solution that will satisfy all parties , but it will also naturally have to listen to the views of the other Member States .
In fact , this maligned budget for next year increases administrative expenditure by 3.4 % .
We are trying to find , and we are committed to finding , solutions which will ensure that there are adequate numbers of staff to deal with important matters .
Madam President , I am a bit disappointed with the conservative approach of Ms Lehtomäki in her interpretation of the sauna culture .
I should like to thank you all for a very substantive and responsible debate , which clearly shows that this House fully supports the prospects for European integration of the Western Balkans and Kosovo .
We will not gain anything from prolonging the process .
We need to give the Kosovars the tools to help themselves .
As Mr Kacin said , treaty-making powers are needed so that we can negotiate with Kosovo and make it part of the stabilisation and association process .
The best service that Serbia can render the Kosovo Serbs is to participate very constructively in the talks to ensure that minorities are truly protected , once the outcome of the Kosovo status settlement emerges .
Serbia has firm and tangible prospects of joining Europe .
It is in Serbia’s hands and Serbia can make this European aspiration a reality and release the tremendous economic , cultural and intellectual potential that exists in the country .
The Council and Commission are not competing , but cooperating fully and deeply for stability and democracy in the Western Balkans .
Therefore , in order to use that joint competence sensibly , we need cooperation .
How successfully the resource question is resolved will now be up to you , as the budgetary authority .
I am very grateful to the Finnish Presidency for its readiness to play a very constructive role in this very difficult matter .
Indeed , as Mr Lagendijk said , we cannot afford to fail in this test case .     .
Together with the other mechanisms covered by the Stabilisation and Association Agreement , the pact will create a comprehensive framework for the further development of relations between the EU and Albania .
It is important that we start to make effective use of the Interim Agreement once it has entered into force .
Albania is the third country in the Western Balkans ( after Macedonia and Croatia in the former Republic of Yugoslavia ) with which the EU has signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement .
Signing the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and the Interim Agreement does not mean that the work has ended .
We now expect Albania to demonstrate continued and effective progress in the implementation of the agreements .
We will continually stress the importance for Albania , as for the other countries in the Western Balkans , of stepping up measures to prevent corruption and organised crime .
The current political climate in Albania is worrying and is a serious threat to the progress of reform .
That means that Albania too has a future place in the Europe Union .
We must nevertheless remember that each country ’s progress towards EU accession stands or falls on its own merits in its attempts to meet EU requirements .
The Union must of course continue to help , but most of the work still to do can only be done by Albania
