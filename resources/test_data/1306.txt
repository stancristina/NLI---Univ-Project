Commissioner , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , winter will soon be here and our citizens ' pleas to the European Union must not go unheeded .
Earlier , Mrs Schroeder spoke of the villages or regions bordering her home town of Dresden .
We do , however , have a responsibility .
In order to gauge the progress made by Macedonia , however , we sent a delegation of experts last June as part of the regional CARDS programme .
Three years ago , Mr President , the world stock markets were all bullish .
It is obvious that we in Europe are directly affected by what could happen .
Mr Poettering and Mrs Maij-Weggen emphasised that we are eagerly awaiting the details promised by the British Prime Minister , which should arrive in the next few minutes .
So far , we have not yet been given any evidence whatsoever that they exist in a country that is dying on its feet , where light bulbs can no longer be found , where there is no lead for schoolchildren 's pencils because these are made of graphite and where even a number of UN observers condemned the role that they were being made to play .
I shall end with an anecdote : three years ago , my brother , a Catholic priest , visited Iraq .
Which position must they adopt ?
Secondly , what guarantees can Europe give Baghdad that , once it has been proven that its arsenal has been dismantled or it has been verified that there are no weapons of mass destruction , America will not immediately attack , once they can see that the regime is not armed ?
Imperialism equates to war .
In doing so , they are violating the United Nations ' Charter , international law and , more generally speaking , people 's rights .
The fight against terrorism waged by al-Qa'ida and Mullah Omar is far from over , security in Afghanistan is not , therefore , guaranteed , the reorganisation needed in Afghanistan - which involves creating institutions to ensure the representation of all ethnic groups and respect for international law and human rights - has only just got underway , and , lastly , because the large-scale return of refugees has only served to exacerbate the already disastrous humanitarian situation caused by the war and the drought which have been raging for years .
What we shall ask for is greater transparency in the way this money is used .
We must bear in mind that the subject of war has once again become a major concern in most of our countries .
Who if not Washington is guilty of war crimes , which I , like Mr Wurtz , would like Mr Haarder to speak to us about this afternoon .
The Commission and our staff are , in my view , making miracles happen in Afghanistan , but I sincerely hope , Commissioner , Mr President , that the next time Mr Brahimi and Mr Karzai ask us to step up the peacekeeping force , we might have the courage to say yes .
I therefore propose that we add the short phrase 'in the near future ' , to urge the Commission to present to us , in the near future , the proposals that Mrs Villiers desires , which will enable the Commission to apply this regulation that is , indeed , important .
I would firstly like to congratulate Mr Berenguer Fuster on his work and on his report and then say what great benefit could be derived from a European Parliament resolution which seeks to encourage employment and which recognises the need for State aid .
The report gives an assessment of how these rights are being implemented .
In the name of the Members from Lutte ouvri√®re , I am anxious to affirm my solidarity with those lacking papers who are , in particular in France currently , protesting en masse for the regularisation of their situation .
Even now , however , the institutions of the Union do not seem to understand the basic fact that citizens are deeply attached to their nations and by attacking or by downgrading their nations they are hurting citizens and turning them away from Europe .
This type of procedure should be reserved for certain directives , such as Seveso or Natura 2000 .
I say 'live ' because personal development and the capacity to play a role in our society , in our democracies are also important .
This is where we must develop the partnerships that you underline in your report .
A European website on the various options for learning will be up and running before the end of the year .
Furthermore , the integration programmes designed for immigrants should exist even for pre-school pupils .
As she has illustrated so well , in our societies , equal opportunities , personal development and the ability to take charge throughout one 's life are dependent upon better access to education and training .
It is true that if we want to create this Europe of knowledge that we have been anxiously hoping for since Lisbon , we must integrate universities in a very real way .
We must ensure , however , that we do not fall into the trap of the dogmatic principle that is so dear to pro-European supporters : wherever there is a European area , everything must , without fail , be merged and blended together .
I must , however , express some reservations about the self-confessed goal of this report through the creation of a European area of higher education .
Now we have European citizenship , a concept that has no meaning at all .
Creating a European area of lifelong learning has become a priority for the twenty-first century and we can only encourage
