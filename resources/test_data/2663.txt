within the not too distant future , we shall reach a point at which European trade policy is so free , open and untrammelled that we do not in actual fact need any preference system , for European trade policy must be permeated by the same basic idea from which the EU proceeds , namely free trade .
Given the concern felt by our colleagues in the ACP countries about budgetisation , I think it important for the role of the ACP-EU Assembly to be strengthened in those countries .
The low turnout at the committee meetings in Brussels is a major problem .
I would therefore ask the Conference of Presidents to review its decision and allow us to hold ACP meetings some time during the weeks in which the political groups meet , since no votes on legislation are held then and we can decide , internally in the groups , on our agendas .     Mr President , I too wish to thank Mr Bowis for his constructive work .
There are , however , a number of problems that we need to remedy very soon .
Moreover , we need to be better at following up a number of the decisions we take .
It is one of the most important and most effective tools we have for holding those who commit genocide and war crimes accountable .
We can see how the United States now actively punishes ACP countries in the Caribbean , Africa and the Pacific which dare to sign the agreement concerning the International Criminal Court .
The total cost is probably closer to at least EUR 300 million per year .
These resources could instead be invested in technical research or something else that promotes growth .
We have seen the many-faceted wealth of invention that exists when it comes to exploiting women’s bodies .
A proposal as cynical as that concerned with buying and selling egg cells should not be possible in a civilised and humane society .
If this were to be permitted , heaven knows what would be the future of such a market for buying and selling .
That is something quite different from this buyers ’ and sellers ’ market .
EU projects may , then , reduce the need for state appropriations to the individual Member States .
The Lisbon Process must not be allowed to become the jumping-off point for a large number of new projects at EU level that require funding by the Member States .
For each new official in Brussels , the total number of officials in the Member States increases by a factor of five , ten or twenty-five .
The new directives have to be implemented , monitoring must be tightened up .
This same phenomenon can be observed in a number of areas .
Through our ambitions to harmonise , legislate and become involved in every conceivable issue , we run the risk of putting a brake on growth .
I do not think that the original document from the Commission succeeded in doing this .
If we in Parliament can effectively make this point to the Council and if it becomes policy in the future , then we shall have succeeded .     – Madam President , in the light of the shortcomings that have characterised the Lisbon Process , it should be stressed that the most important issues here are not about what we want to achieve , but about how we can achieve it .
What Mrs Doyle just said is correct .
There is nothing so crucial to social cohesion as opportunities for new businesses and new jobs .
The most important integration process in the European Union is happening right now while we are sitting here .
The old Member States have had the advantage of developing their social economies and their competitiveness in peace and freedom for over fifty years .
That is why the Services Directive is important , and that is why it is important to remember that it is a question here of a European integration that is vital to competitiveness .
Nobody would object to having taxes that are simple and fair rather than complicated and unfair .
Moreover , we have opposed several amendments that we would in principle support in the Swedish Parliament , but which we oppose at EU level out of concern for democracy in the Member States .
The idea of ‘growth first – we can deal with the rest afterwards ’ is wrong and represents an unfortunate return to the debate that took place prior to the EU’s adoption of its sustainability strategy in Gothenburg in 2001 .
Such investment would stimulate growth and create new job opportunities .
The situation of the Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor is truly a nightmare .
On 29 March , a court is finally to make a pronouncement on the death sentences against these six people , and this date is therefore incredibly critical .
In our work on a gradual rapprochement between the EU and Libya within the context of the Barcelona Process , this case is a critical test of the direction that relations between us may take .
I am very pleased that the Commissioner supports the action plan and sees opportunities for the EU to support Libya in this way so that better care might be obtained in future for those infected with HIV.
We all know that that is not how it works at all in Brussels and Strasbourg .
Political power is continually being shifted from the Member States to the institutions of the EU.
For them , the principle of subsidiarity is not a guiding principle but rather an obstacle in their way .
It does not put the question of what the EU should do when the Member States are unable to deal with a task themselves .
How are we to strengthen the links between research and industry
