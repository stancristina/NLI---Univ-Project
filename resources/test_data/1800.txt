This view is also expressed in the report .
The background to our voting differently is , rather , the fact that I participated in the handling of this matter in the Committee on Budgets and do not see any possibility of influencing agricultural policy by voting 'no ' today .
A 'no ' vote today would not , therefore , lead to any real change but only to delays .
We are not therefore concerned here with substantially different views of agricultural policy .
The report addresses the consequences of the BSE crisis for the Budget .
It is high time that we abandon a form of agricultural production which simply aims for the highest possible yield and does not take sufficient account of quality and the interests of consumers .
We also support Amendments 1-3 , tabled by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , which make clear the need the need for agricultural reforms and for the individual Member States to take more responsibility for cofunding .
There are many good aspects to the Brunetta report .
However , it was not a good idea to oblige the authorities to see to it that prices for roaming and interconnection are cost-based and to require that the price of calls in real time be shown on the telephone ' s display .
We have chosen to vote against Amendments 23 , 25 and 53 .
In our view , it would be going too far to instruct the Member States to merge their various national supervisory authorities and require them to set up advisory offices for the general public .
Nor was it a good idea to approve Amendment 27 and , in that way , specify that the administrative charges for licences must not be based upon service categories or the territorial coverage of the undertaking providing a service .
This limitation may do smaller undertakings a lot of harm .
Mr President , Commissioner , Europe has always been , and remains today , a paradoxical part of the world .
A few days ago , a young Kurdish man was shot by the police in a medium-sized town in Sweden .
It must go without saying that every refugee who wishes to stay within the EU must have his case carefully examined .
The basic rule must be that people have the right to travel freely into the EU.
As matters now stand , there is no overview or comprehensive vision .
The position of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is therefore misleading in as much as it defends a continuation of the present EU policy based upon subsidies and tariff barriers against surrounding countries .
For us , it is unthinkable that the Member States ' responsibility for checking passports should be transferred to private transport companies .
The severe sanctions proposed by the Council constitute a significant threat to the right of asylum .
- ( SV ) A common policy on temporary protection for displaced persons is to be welcomed , especially so as to ensure that all Member States are involved in taking care of people forced to flee from regions affected by war .
Temporary protection in the EU' s Member States must not prevent people from seeking asylum as soon as they arrive in the Member State responsible or during the period that the temporary protection applies .
The Commission produced a good proposal , and it has been improved since the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy went through it .
It is only democratic that our citizens should be able to exercise influence , and it goes without saying that they should be entitled to all the information they need in order to perform their civic duties in society .
It is also important that Amendments 19 and 20 should go through , stating that authorities are responsible for helping the individual citizen or organisation to obtain information .
Mr President , I too must join in the chorus of congratulations and say , on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group , that we support the report and think that a good proposal has been made better .
That is why it is also a matter of democracy that people should be able to acquire insight into environmental issues in good time .
When it comes to future regulations , it is also important that other institutions , too , should be fully covered by the Aarhus Convention , for example the European Investment Bank whose activities have quite a big effect upon the environment in different ways .
The citizen must therefore be made central to environmental policy if we are successfully to be able to make the adjustments required in order to guarantee sustainable development .
In 1998 , the Member States signed the UN/ECE Convention on Access to Information , Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters - the Aarhus Convention .
Another main aim is to remedy the shortcomings identified in the practical application of Directive 90/313/EEC , adopted in 1990 .
Since the issue of public authorities was raised , I am able to say that the Commission has approved Mrs Korhola' s amendment defining 'authorities ' .
This is entirely in line with the Aarhus Convention .
The proposal nonetheless allows the Member States to decide how these obligations are to be put into practice .
In general , the Commission is able to approve these changes .
The main objective is to establish basic conditions for ensuring public access to information on the environment .
No rules are laid down for compelling the Member States to set up registers .
We in the Commission cannot now approve the amendments affecting this particular issue because they fall outside the scope of this directive aimed at the Member States .
It is precisely this problem that is
