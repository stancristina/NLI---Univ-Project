that we have to pay what goes towards cows and wheat but not what goes towards disasters .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I would like to add my voice to the messages of condolence and thanks to the honourable Members .
Mr President , I am aware of the efforts being made by Mr Vitorino to achieve concrete measures for the control of illegal immigration throughout the European Union and especially in these outermost regions such as the Canary Islands .
We have therefore collaborated with the Italian Government to produce a viability report on the control of European Union land and air borders .
It also contributes to progress on the ambitious Lisbon objectives .
I would like to mention two key points : firstly , the Commission proposes a better structure for the cycle of policy coordination based on three points : execution , political orientations and guidelines .
In this respect , we suggest that we focus more on the medium term when it comes to drawing up guidelines .
In addition to these improvements which will begin to operate by the 2003 cycle , the Commission has proposed a series of amendments relating to the law currently in force in the Treaties , aimed at the coordination of economic policies .
I believe that there is not ; I believe that the situation is precisely the opposite .
Nevertheless , we believe that the new procedure allows Parliament to take two types of action .
Mr Goebbels , in order to clarify the position we have presented the issue very quickly .
We produce broad guidelines every three years , but this will not prevent us from having an annual modification and an annual debate .
We are talking about how to take better advantage of the possibilities offered by the Treaties .
If we do not talk about five years , the problems the honourable Member mentions will always exist .
Contradictions in the process are precisely what we are trying to prevent , for a very simple reason : the process starts with the Commission , with a position which must be consistent ; that position must be decided on or approved by the European Council ; the Ecofin Councils and the Employment Council will have to work on the guidelines produced by the spring European Council , and it will be the June European Council that finally accepts guidelines which must be consistent amongst themselves and consistent with what the European Council itself has proposed .
My final point : the legitimacy of the process , raised by Mrs Randzio-Plath .
The result is a text which has been rebalanced in order to increase consumer protection , especially with regard to the information they are to be provided with , complaint procedures and the situation of minors , amongst others .
We therefore feel that the solution adopted is appropriate and consequently the enormous majority of our Group - which is not ultra-liberal but rather is in favour of a social market economy - is going to support it .
I am going to be the last speaker to say that sales and re-sales at a loss cannot be considered commercial promotion practices , because these practices distort the principles of fair competition and in particular prejudice small retailers , who do not have the margins to compete in such a situation .
There is currently no regulation on block exemption in this field and the guidelines on this type of aid are based on a series of diverse communications which are not regulatory .
All these criteria , included in Amendment No 1 from the Group of the Party of European Socialists , are aimed directly at promoting employment in the least-favoured sectors , and their inclusion in the Regulation in no way distorts competition .
But , quite simply , the honourable Members will have to recognise that whatever the ideological position they hold , this is a strange and extravagant idea at this time , which should not appear in the report , since it relates to other issues .
The European Commission has carried out an exhaustive and rigorous mid-term assessment report on the programme , which allows us to make proposals for the future with a view to achieving the objective of 'zero violence ' .
The NGOs have played an important role in the fight against violence , but the public institutions must also be involved - so far only 10 % of the programmes have been implemented by them - as well as universities and study and research centres .
Amongst these measures we propose a European Year for combating violence against women and children .
Organised prostitution , domestic violence , the alarming increase in violence against children and the abandonment of many of them by their families , demonstrate that we are talking about an issue which must be dealt with through a system of shared competences .
It is impossible to carry on working without a basic legal framework , particularly when we know we are not protecting the victims .
Sex equality policy , measures to combat social exclusion and poverty , policies on the integrating of disabled people socially and taking advantage of the capacities they do have , and opting for life-long learning and training and , with it , the need to adapt to the new forms of work and the reconciliation of work with family life .
Allow me , therefore , to ask you what Mr Patten asked the Members of this Parliament : is the Council unanimous ?
These are counterproductive .
With regard to the philosophy of the current American Government , I believe that Bush junior should pay greater attention to what his father did 10 years ago , for one reason : President Bush senior achieved a very broad coalition and acted in accordance with the United Nations mandate .
