Democracy is about EU values of peace and respect , not about wanting your neighbour to disappear from the world’s map as Mr al-Zahar , the new Palestinian Foreign Minister , put it this week .
The EU must demand that the PA Government renounces violence , recognises the State of Israel and the relevant agreements and commits to the roadmap , otherwise the EU should not legitimise Hamas in any way .
In seems that in an Orwellian way , these are the more equal animals among the TEN-T projects .
This year’s subject is very pertinent , since we are facing the threat of a worldwide pandemic .
Investing in preventive work is always the best option as far as both people and the economy are concerned .
It makes sense to invest resources in everyday structures that support people’s health , and not just in corrective work .
Educated doctors and nurses save human lives .
The skills of healthcare personnel staff are being especially put to the test with new threats to health such as bird flu .
Even though it may be a basic premise that everyone is vaccinated and receives the drugs they need , there may come a situation where , for example , part of a vaccination batch is missing .
I strongly agree with the calls in the resolution to improve the focus for development cooperation so that it is used for human and social development .     Mr President , there are many things in the report by the ACP delegation which in my capacity as Member I should draw positive attention to .
I am not therefore talking now about the situation concerning the ACP countries so much as the work of the delegation .
The meeting was a success , and Great Britain , the country holding the presidency at the time , and the City of Edinburgh deserve praise for organising the event so well .
Hopefully the practice will also continue when my country , Finland , takes over the presidency in July .
It is just a slight nuisance that our meetings always partly coincide with Committee Week .
It would perhaps be worth testing this option .
I am also happy that standing committees have been set up .
I realised how viable the system was when I myself produced a report .     .
I have often driven in that part of the world .
You cannot imagine how hard their lives are .
That is what it amounts to .
How many more conflicts do we need ?
And now Darfur is far too far away .
When we have international conflicts or problems , we need international governance .
Mr President , before giving more substantive responses to the questions by Mr Brok , Mr Moscovici and Mr Van Orden , I would like to begin by expressing my sympathy for all people affected by the floods that recently hit Bulgaria and Romania and countries falling outside the scope of today’s debate , in particular Serbia .
As I said to the Committee on Foreign Affairs on 3 April , the Commission will report on developments until the end of April , so the cut-off date is 30 April , the end of this week .
The full factual basis will therefore be available in the first two weeks of May .
However , let me underline the priority of all priorities .
These are the critical yardsticks , since a fully functioning justice system underpins the functioning of the whole of society and the economy in its entirety .
Concerning the second question on the reform of the judiciary and the fight against corruption and organised crime , both countries have shown determination to undertake necessary reforms in this field .
In Bulgaria amendments have been made to the constitution , reducing the scope of the immunity of Members of Parliament and establishing the leading function of the prosecution service in most investigations .
However , there remains ambiguity concerning the independence of the judiciary and there is a serious backlog in cases related to organised crime .
The competent authorities seem in general to have a reactive instead of a proactive attitude .
Finally , on Mr Brok’s question concerning the safeguard clauses and monitoring , safeguard clauses are meant to tackle the possible negative consequences that may persist due to shortcomings in Bulgaria and Romania after accession .
In addition , the accession treaty contains three safeguard clauses : a general economic safeguard clause , a specific internal market safeguard clause and a third one which relates to justice and home affairs .
It is important to note that this does not require a unanimous Council decision ; it requires a Commission decision based on our objective risk assessment of a candidate country ’s possible shortcomings .
It is clear that , in order to have a meaningful system of safeguard clauses , we also need a monitoring mechanism and , in its role as guardian of the treaties , the Commission will assume this duty and will verify the implementation of EU legislation in the two countries .     .
In my view there is lots of common ground for such a Commission recommendation on 16 May that complies with Parliament’s views that I have heard today .
Let me just sum up the view and position of the Commission as regards the accession date and conditions regarding Bulgaria and Romania .
In that regard , the jury is still out , at least until 16 May .
However , at the same time let me underline that the real critical task for both countries is not to lose any momentum as regards the reforms and their implementation .
The essential yardstick will be the progress both countries can still make as regards the reform of the judiciary and their fight against corruption and crime .
For that
