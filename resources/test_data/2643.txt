30 September , several cows which were drinking water at the tunnel exit presented neurotoxic symptoms and had to be destroyed .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the rapporteur rightly wants to defend the democratization of information by the press , at least keeping a certain status for the press against audio-visual competition .
Madame President , I can reply very quickly to Mr McMahon .
As for the checks , they must be unexpected and carried out randomly .
Amendments Nos 3 and 4 , which we tabled in committee and which were adopted , specify that the restrictions and financial penalties which apply to the export of live animals from the European Union to third countries must also apply to the import of animals from these countries , if the conditions for the transport of live animals are not appropriate .
Should the Council and the Commission not also be considering measures to propose and implement morality in the relationship between producers and consumers on the one hand , and international negotiation and large-scale distribution on the other , for example by fixing a maximum multiplication factor between the production price and the sales price , in the interests of both producers and consumers ?
Instead of talking about overproduction should we not see the reality of under consumption ?
I am worried about the harmful effects of such a system , which seems to have allowed some people to plant more so that they would have more to grub up , let alone turn themselves into veritable premium hunters - planting premiums , then grubbing up premiums , via premiums for the destruction of surpluses .
In fact , we know that consumption evolves both quantitatively and qualitatively .
You have mentioned that , even before this conflict broke , the French Government was in touch with your office , and with leading officials in Member States , to pass on information , to take stock of the road blocks , and all the road block points were known .
We cannot talk about a serious single market with such distortions of competition .
And even though it took that horror , I am glad to say that in the Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs we achieved - as I hope we will do in this House - unanimous agreement on all the measures designed to combat this scourge .
Mr President , my answer is no , even if that is hard to say , because democratic states are founded on certain basic principles , one of which is the separation of powers .
The decision to be taken is no small matter .
Mr President , the level of civilization of a society is measured by the way it treats its children .
Yes to the creation of the European centre for missing children , help for victims and their parents , the establishment of appropriate databases .
For my part , and here I am expressing the opinion of several colleagues in my group , this implication , designed to put pressure on Mr Wathelet to resign from his present position as judge at the European Court of Justice , is unacceptable .
The European Parliament , a political body par excellence , should beware of turning itself into an authority that judges a man as a function of a morality defined case by case .
Mr President , but in the absence of Madam Commissioner , it was a good idea to prepare an own-initiative report on the future of the CFP after 2002 based on an uncompromising balance sheet of the successes and failures of twenty years of blue Europe .
This means strengthening aid to small-scale fishing , giving it the means of developing instead of holding it back , and strengthening the market sphere , in particular in the essential area of fresh fish and the quality of the products .
In reality , Mrs Fraga Est√©vez , we certainly regulate intra-Community fishing , but there is also an extra-Community problem .
I just wonder .
Databases built up to this effect have been very successful .
Europe 's advantage lies above all with technology and training .
Mr President , Mr Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it would be unjust , and indeed quite untrue , to say that globalization and international movements of companies do not have negative effects .
But alongside internal relocations , there are also , of course , relocations outside the Union .
So what impact can the rapporteur 's recommendation to the European multinationals about the moral duty to "be in the vanguard of social progress ' have ?
Why not analyze the perverse effects of European subsidies which become causal factors , at the origin of numerous relocation decisions , like the ECIIP programme and even certain projects supported by Phare and Tacis .
There is also the addition of a new annex IV to the directive .
But we will vote for this text , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , remembering our duty to our children and in the hope of leaving them a Europe with more to offer .
They must not be trivialized by being subjected to the rules applying to commercial insurance .
They are particularly significant and always topical .
In this respect , the sub-committee invokes , with involuntary humour , Directive 94/27/EEC on the use of nickel which , in effect , takes stock of this risk for various objects in current use .
We cannot hide behind words !
The problem might have been smaller if it did not attack the very essence of the directive .
We need to find solutions as quickly as possible to an imminent environmental disaster which will be difficult to reverse in the medium term .
The report by Martin Schulz gives us the opportunity
