Thirdly , as mentioned by Mr Cavada and Mrs Roure , major changes have taken place in the area of justice and home affairs , with a new institutional framework entering into force as regards visas , asylum and immigration , whereby codecision with Parliament and qualified majority voting in the Council now apply .
Consequently , the EU’s system of powers – of the Member States and the European institutions – is not morally neutral .
How do the Council and the Commission propose to address the issue of prison reform ?
I must take this opportunity to praise the efforts and skills of President Juncker and , more broadly , of the Luxembourg Presidency , throughout this process .
Firstly , the Stability and Growth Pact .
The European Council’s agreement was a very positive outcome , restoring credibility to the Pact and preserving the Commission ’s prerogatives .
The Commission intends to present its proposals for amending the relevant regulations before the end of this month so that reform can be completed by June .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , thanks to the very active role played by the Presidency , the recent meeting of the European Council has generated the political impetus that was needed to relaunch our pursuit of the Lisbon aims .
The discussions among the Heads of State or Government showed that the Member States had truly taken our ideas on board .
Improved governance , accepted as essential to implementation by the Member States , was also an important aspect , because it really served to test the credibility of the new Lisbon Strategy and to establish whether the Member States were genuinely disposed to accept a stronger system of governance .
This is an important exercise through which the Commission confirms the sharper focus on growth and employment and provides the Member States with a single coherent framework for the preparation of their respective programmes .
The second milestone in this process will be the presentation of a Community Lisbon programme .
The fourth and final milestone will be the preparation and analysis of the national programmes , which , we envisage , will take place in the second half of the year .
The third major issue discussed by the European Council was sustainable development .
Lastly , I am pleased that the European Council has clearly signalled the will of the Union to reinvigorate the international negotiations by exploring options for a post-2012 arrangement .
I am counting on your participation and active support .
Against this backdrop , how can anyone accept the so-called relaunch of the Lisbon Strategy , when it is based on competitiveness and on creating a workforce that is more attractive to companies , when it places the accent on deepening liberalisation in areas such as services , on increasing the flexibility of the markets , on reducing workers ’ rights , on extending the number of sectors paying low salaries , when it seeks to keep proposals for directives on the organisation of working time and on creating an internal market for services ?
We believe that fighting inequality of income , promoting equal rights and opportunities and fostering genuine convergence should be at the top of the EU’s economic and social agenda .     . – To its dismay , the European Council of 22 and 23 March was characterised by an issue that was not on its agenda but which was imposed upon it .
The Commission and Parliament are putting off taking decisions in a bid to avoid providing more and more valid arguments to vote ‘no’ .
The process of Bulgaria’s accession , which is subject to an individual assessment , is moving ahead at the expected rate .
Given the fact that insufficient progress was made in comparison with the progress made by the 15 enlargement States on 1 May 2004 , Bulgaria’s plan to join the EU on that date was postponed .
Of course , the accession to the Union of a country such as Bulgaria will inevitably entail costs , which will hopefully be backed up by increasingly effective commitment to internal cohesion , and , most importantly , by Bulgaria enhancing its own ability to interact with and relate to the world – in other words , greater diversity .
What is more , it ‘calls ’ for the introduction of ‘greater flexibility in the labour market ’ and for the pace of privatisation to be kept up .
I therefore feel that Parliament should add its opinion to those already delivered and publicly declare itself in favour of that country ’s accession .
The fact is that , although we do not know the feelings of the Romanian people , accession gives rise to expectations , following enormous demands and impositions that we feel are unacceptable , not least structural reforms leading to privatisations , which have had a negative impact on people’s lives .
This must not , however , disguise the most important factor on the road to accession , namely that the criteria to be met must be realistic .
Romania’s accession to the EU has been in the pipeline since 1995 .
I support this motion for a resolution because , among the concerns that it raises about this country are concerns that I share .
Hopefully , further solutions can be implemented in the pursuit of Romania’s objective to become a member of the EU.
Portugal is well aware of the benefits of its own accession , and should be among those Member States that best appreciate the advantages of accession and that support it most strongly .     .
We voted in favour of this second reading despite some differences of opinion on certain aspects of the new directive establishing design requirements for energy-using products .
I welcome the main objective of the proposal before us , which is to ensure the free movement of certain energy-using consumer products , to improve their environmental
