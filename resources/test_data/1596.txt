In return , the European Parliament will see the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure abolished and so be given more power over expenditure .
The EU 's prime ministers are being given more power and the Commission is being strengthened , as is the European Parliament .
They are left with less democracy , every time that more supranational and undemocratic power is handed out in the EU.
- ( DA ) During the vote on the Statute , we voted in favour of transparency and comparability and against hidden income , as well as in favour of abolishing the system for reimbursing travel expenses and replacing it with a system through which actual expenditure is reimbursed .
We agree that there are advantages in the EU 's adopting rules on short-term residence permits with a view to combating organised illegal immigration or trafficking in human beings .
Mr President , last week I saw on Danish television Parliament 's President in close communication with the member of his own party who is now the sitting President of the European Council , and I imagine , without being able to lip-read , that there were two related subjects that might have occupied these two colleagues .
The first was Turkish accession to the EU , and the second was the issue of referendums .
What , however , was the problem for the Prime Minister and what emerged at our group meeting in Copenhagen was the fact that people back home could confuse Turkey 's accession with the new treaty .
What advice did Parliament 's President give the member of his own party in Denmark ?
Mr President , I should like to say thank you to the rapporteur for his tireless enthusiasm for European development and for his splendid and very detailed report .
The first point concerns the procedure for revising the treaties .
That is something we have in any case learned from this process .
I do not believe that it would be in keeping with the prevailing spirit of our Community if we were to take control of the EU 's development away from the Member States .
I am in actual fact afraid that such a procedure would in itself stand in the way of development in this Europe of ours because people back home would be very sceptical about giving Europe more competences if , for example , they were not to feel that they were in control of what was going on .
I think , therefore , that we have to recognise that Europe is founded upon its citizens and nations but that the sustaining , constituent units of our Union are the Member States and that this must naturally be reflected in our ratification procedure .
The second point concerns the place of the social dialogue in the Community .
I believe that such a procedure would give rise to an irrelevant third party in the social dialogue .
If we are serious about beginning a social dialogue and perhaps , in time , creating proper European agreements , we must recognise that it is the two sides of industry themselves which must negotiate and that the legislators must stay outside the process .
Mr President , following the friendly observation directed to me by Mr von Boetticher , I wish to say that I am in no doubt that there are criminals outside Europe but that they are nonetheless small fry in comparison with those within the European Union 's own institutions .
There is of course a type of criminal beside whom the small fry we have outside the EU pale into insignificance .
My main criticism and my attitude to the proposals before us are expressed in a minority opinion on the report .
They are based on the wonder I have always felt at the European Union 's and its institutions ' ability to empty the language of meaning and , in certain cases , to make the language mean the opposite of what was intended .
Opposition to the proposals before us is based on the fact that surveillance technology is being reinforced but that insufficient attention is being given to the rule of law , in spite of protests to the contrary .
A number of basic requirements are made of Europol , but there is no reasonable guarantee whatsoever that Europol will comply with those requirements .
I must add , moreover , that what makes matters more alarming from the point of view of the rule of law is that the powers in question are linked to an extremely unclear concept of terrorism .
There is no reasonable likelihood of the bodies concerned being of a sufficiently trustworthy character .
We are used to meeting close to midnight , so it is splendid to be here today and see everyone awake .
It is estimated that , over the next 35 years , up to 500 000 deaths will be directly related to the serious illnesses caused by asbestos .
I think that experience with asbestos and the debate in Parliament and elsewhere show very clearly how incredibly important it is that we take the precautionary principle very seriously .
For many years , this principle was not taken seriously , and we can see the consequences today .
I cannot refrain from saying today that I should also like to see Liberals also being supportive in connection with other problems concerned with the working environment and showing a desire , which they have not always displayed , to take other problems in this area just as seriously as they have shown they take those arising from asbestos .
It is now proposed that employers should provide education programmes so that workers are clearer as to how they can protect themselves , and it is great progress that employers ' responsibility for this area has been made so very clear .
It would , of course , also be splendid
