We saw this in the Green Paper on Lomé and in the lack of priority of staff in the field , which must be increased from its present three and appointed at high level to give them some effectiveness .
Mr President , with the Amsterdam Treaty you and other Britons are getting a written constitution without democracy .
And the other 14 countries in the EU are getting a new constitution , a new basic law , this little bagatelle in fact , which will replace this little bagatelle , the Danish Constitution .
The Court of Justice made that up as a principle , and what is new about the Amsterdam Treaty is that it is written into the protocol on subsidiarity .
So this is not a principle of subsidiarity , but the opposite .
And that is why it is a new written constitution , which Great Britain is now getting for the first time in your lives and in the lives of other Britons .
No, it is not .
It is a constitution which does include fundamental rights and social rights , but they are spread around the treaty .
But the basic principle is that the fundamental rights of the Member States in the national constitutions are being exported , and with them the practice of the Commission on Human Rights and the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg , to the Court of Justice in Luxembourg and to the Union 's authorities , which shall act in unison .
As far as content is concerned this is a constitution , but as far as form is concerned it is a normal international agreement .
But the most important thing that history will remember us for is not the treaty , but what it paves the way for .
That is what the whole purpose of the European cooperation was .
I agree that with 20 or 25 Member States we should change to majority decision-making in several areas so that the Union can carry out its core tasks effectively .
Imagine that we have 5 countries ready for membership in the year 2002 .
Do we really want to take the new , young democracies hostage over this dispute with the Council ?
I would like to ask the representative of the Council what you think of paragraphs 15 and 16 of the report by Mr Tsatsos and Mr Méndez de Vigo .
And I would like to ask the representative of the Council to repeat what your Prime Minister , Mr Juncker , said .
These three countries of course have the right to have their opinion and to promote it , but , and this is the crux of the matter , if Parliament goes in and stops the enlargement , and if the twelve countries do not fall in line with the three countries , history will condemn this Parliament .
Therefore , ladies and gentlemen , vote against the last part of paragraph 15 and against a some words in the introduction to paragraph 16 .
Mr President , enlargement is now the EU 's most important task and no obstacles must be put in its way by making absolute demands for reforms before an enlargement .
Therefore there are parts of paragraphs 15 and 16 for which I cannot vote .
The Amsterdam Treaty is not perfect , because we human beings are not perfect .
We have different traditions , cultures , living conditions and problems , so the Amsterdam Treaty is a compromise .
It is incomplete , but it is a good basis for peace in Europe .
I am therefore voting yes to the Committee 's report , which is a signal that a yes to ratification is the most important thing .
Mr President , let me first establish that the Amsterdam Treaty is a much better treaty in our view than the Maastricht Treaty .
The Amsterdam Treaty places emphasis on what we in Denmark have called our important issues , but they are also important issues for many others .
However , I would like to say that we have some difficulties with the report on the Amsterdam Treaty on some points .
We think it is very regrettable that people should want to put obstacles in the way of enlargement by demanding that all institutional reforms should be in place before enlargement begins .
As the rapporteur should be aware , Denmark does participate , on an intergovernmental basis , while both Ireland and Great Britain are entirely outside the cooperation .
It would have been preferable to us if this section had not been there .
What it says is quite simply wrong .
The report also sets the stage for further cooperation in the field of defence and security policy .
Apart from that I would say that we agree that the European Parliament is helping to make decisions in the EU more democratic and transparent .
It is also important to remember that there is a wider perspective to a yes to Amsterdam than what we are discussing here today .
We must not forget that perspective .
I am broadly in agreement with what Mr Rothley said on these points .
It is , so to speak , the EC &#x02BC ;s route from a Common Market to Union law - or , as Mr Nassauer put it during the earlier debate , a legal internal market .
It is an integration process which - and this is a fact that has largely been overlooked in this debate - involves dismantling the national institutions and legal traditions on which Denmark&#x02BC ;s law-governed society , for example , is built .
It is evident both in Mr Nassauer&#x02BC ;s report and in the earlier reports , and the keystone can , of course , be found in the Amsterdam
