There are signs of xenophobia and racism in that , apart from the chanting , banners and flags with emblems of the terrible past , full of hatred and incitement to terror , are also making their appearance .
The spread of doping and financial exploitation in relation to television rights and marketing have turned sport , and football in particular , into a field of competition and conflicting interests .
In numerous European countries , especially over the last five years , another phenomenon has emerged which has led very well-known and historic clubs to bankruptcy but not to spending : ambitious plans , vain hopes , unpaid coaches and players , debts reaching as far as FIFA and UEFA.
Football is not simply a game which lasts 90 minutes , nor is it a purely business activity .
Nonetheless , the Commission could adopt measures designed to strengthen the ties between footballers and football clubs and the local society , as we heard earlier .
Sport is and must remain the basic axis of social integration and I hope that the Commission will move in this direction .
The conflict in Columbia is therefore political , economic and social , and anyone putting forward arguments about terrorism and all the rest is seeking to conceal the political problem and give this barbaric regime an alibi .
Three : a first step could be to apply international humanitarian law , with the exchange of prisoners and detainees by the regime .
Six : assistance and support for paramilitary organisations should cease .
We are all potentially dangerous to the established order and potential terrorists.That is the essence of the Council decision , the application of which is the subject of today 's debate .
These measures , together with the reactionary Hague programme package , are being used to speed up the application of a global network to put on file and terrorise anyone who opposes the terrorism of European and global monopoly capital .
Neither of the presumptive contenders for power wishes to safeguard anything of the sort , given that both were collaborators with the Ukrainian oligarchy and protagonists of the anti-grass roots and anti-labour policy exercised over recent years .
It has now been proven that Community resources and funds result in the redistribution of wealth ; they are being grabbed from the workers and from the poor and less developed regions and are being given to big business and to the plutocracy and more developed regions of the EU.
The current conflict expresses internal oppositions by big business , not the interests of the workers , who are claiming satisfaction of their contemporary needs and fighting for the political orientations to change for the benefit of the majority of the people .     . – By the time today 's debate on AIDS closes , thousands of people will have died , many of whom might have lived if the huge pharmaceutical companies had not blocked the anti-virus drug production and importation process , so as to prevent the monopoly from being broken and its profits from falling .
Every day 8 200 people die .
That is capitalism : savage and barbaric .
This is the policy being promoted by the EU and the governments of the Member States who defend the interests of the monopolies .
As everyone knows , the Ecumenical Patriarchate has , for many centuries , been highly active in fostering the cultural and spiritual progress of orthodox nations .
The main issue which derives from the Copenhagen criteria is respect for the Member States of the European Union with which Turkey is seeking to enter into partnership .
Besides , our group supported the financing regulation for the Turkish Cypriots , with the proviso that the Republic of Cyprus would be respected and that no advantages of a political nature would be offered to the occupying regime .
In reply to the question of reversing the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots , the government of the Republic of Cyprus proposed returning the closed section of Ammohostos to its legal residents and opening the port of Ammohostos , together with the Turkish Cypriots , with the objective of its being operated for the benefit of both sides , a proposal which , unfortunately , has not been accepted .
I call on the European Commission to process immediately a roadmap with a specific and verifiable timetable for the application of the Copenhagen political criteria , with particular emphasis on the recognition of Cyprus by Turkey and the withdrawal of the Turkish occupying forces from the northern part of the island , visible progress in resolving the problems of the Kurdish people , the safeguarding of human rights and the drafting of a new constitution .
The question which arises therefore is institutional : are we an independent political entity or are we a trailer hitched to the American truck ?
Ask your children who study geography if it is in Europe or in Asia .
It fell .
That will be a crime for Europe .
The Turkish Government also provokingly refuses to recognise the Republic of Cyprus and to withdraw its recognition of the pseudo-state .
The European Union legalised these claims during the course of discussions , with the decision taken at Helsinki .
There have been limited rather than material changes ...     – Mr President , in December 1999 , the European Council in Helsinki sent a clear message to Turkey in its decision on Turkey 's actual rather than notional candidacy and by creating a clear framework of terms , preconditions and criteria which Turkey had to implement .
This unanimous EU policy has made a decisive contribution over the last five years to important reforms in Turkey .
However , this message should not be seen as .
In particular , as far as the question of the diplomatic recognition of Cyprus is
