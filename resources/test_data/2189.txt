benefits of the internal market , overlooking the high levels of poverty , exclusion and inequality in the EU , the lack of quality in the jobs that are created , most of which are precarious , and the promises given in Mr Delors ' famous White Paper , which predicted the creation of 15 million jobs ; a target that has now been postponed to 2010 .
I congratulate Mr Harbour on the excellent report he has drafted on the Communication from the Commission to the Council , the European Parliament , the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions : 2002 Review of the Internal Market Strategy .
I therefore agree with the rapporteur when he states that a fully operational internal market for services will increase consumers ' options and will enable them to benefit from services provided in other Member States .

I voted in favour of this report because of its enormous importance , within the framework of sustainable development , for the adoption of better measures with which to combat the factors contributing to the deterioration of forests in the European Union .
We must adopt fire prevention action , bearing in mind especially that these must be in ...
I regret the fact that there was an insistence on not clarifying the language used and that confusion could allow international sponsorship of abortion policies with European Union funds .
Under the guise of altruism in granting aid , the EU cannot promote and even less encourage these practices , for two fundamental reasons : the first is respect for human rights - and in particular to protect the right to life - and the second is due to the limits imposed by the sovereignty of the States and populations who will benefit from our financial aid .
The report is broadly to be welcomed , and so we voted in favour of it .
I abstained from voting on this report .
The 1997 report by the United Nations Office on Drug Control and Crime Prevention ( ODCCP) , stated that 'efforts to reduce world consumption will be less effective if programmes for reducing demand are undermined by calls for drugs to be legalised ' .
The danger of chemical contamination , especially during combustion , is indeed high and hence the justification for the protection advised by western military manuals available on the Internet .

The situation in the region is apparently quite delicate .
The ties that bind us to the Venezuelan people and State run very deep .
Our expression of respect for the Constitution , as included in the text , could be used improperly in Venezuela by one of the parties involved .
Our position has not changed : we strongly condemn Mr Mugabe 's regime , the extremely violent , ongoing and shameful breaches of human rights , the way in which he is destroying his own country and condemning his people to poverty .
The question in my mind is this : given the difficulties that have arisen and that we ourselves have felt , with the suspension of the Joint ACP-European Union Assembly , which have also been felt in the Commonwealth , and which are also currently dividing Europe , would it not be better to act somewhat more intelligently ?
Mr Tsvangirai has , as you know , already been nominated twice for the Sakharov Prize , which Parliament awards each year .
We are therefore concerned to learn of the Commission 's proposals , which overlook the importance of public services in areas such as energy , transport , postal services and telecommunications , in terms of social cohesion , the public 's well-being and social inclusion .
The role of the World Trade Organization must also be reduced and the United Nations General Assembly must be given a more active role in this field .
It is increasingly senseless , treating some cultural products as if they were industrial products , to establish forms of protection that limit their access to certain locations , such as cinemas .
Firstly , the list covering the funding and the system of tariffs for ports , clear rules on state aid to ports and , finally , the adoption of measures guaranteeing access to the port services market through legislative instruments established at the Commission 's initiative and within its powers .
As I stated , the obligation on current port operators to absorb the labour force contracted to ports on salaries around three times higher than the average in sectors with identical operational requirements means that the directive will not be able to allow a port user to engage in cargo-handling activity without having to be accredited , thereby using workers in more favourable conditions than those binding current port operators under the law and under collective bargaining agreements .
Firstly , I agree with the rapporteur on the need to insist that the European Commission makes increasing rural development aid under the CAP its priority guideline .
Consequently , some regions ' levels will increase , with major risks of losing structural funds because they exceed the minimum levels that would entitle them to Community aid .
In fact , year after year , reform after reform , the budgetary procedure has been amended on an informal basis , by means of political agreements between the various institutions involved .
More Europe means , amongst other things , more money .
Thirdly , because I believe that the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure and their respective procedures has become artificial .
I would remind you that every year , enormous sums intended for the CAP end up being refunded to the Member States because they have not been properly used .
Let me explain : the purpose of Amendment No 13 was to restrict self-handling to crew members .
