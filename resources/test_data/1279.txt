Andalusian government and the Ombudsman .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , are you not in favour of a periodic assessment ?
The connection between our economic activity and the increase in pollution , with the greenhouse effect and the onset of climate changes makes it advisable for us to immediately ratify the Kyoto protocols on the reduction of the gases which cause this effect .
In this respect , two facts worry us .
The fourth and last point is currently the most important : the amount of aid .
All of this should be accompanied by the presentation of periodic reports to the European Parliament on the evolution and assessment of the results obtained .
As the Commission has said , the consequences of Mitch will considerably reduce the results of the efforts towards economic recovery and investment made there during the last decade by the European Union .
This report has inevitably been influenced by the tragic consequences of Hurricane Mitch .
The Commission must at all times ensure the appropriate allocation of resources in accordance with the priorities agreed .
Mr President , European civil society has already shown how sensitive it is to the tragedy suffered by the peoples of Central America .
On the other hand , as Mr Salafranca has pointed out very clearly , I also absolutely share his disagreement not only with the budgetary restrictions , but also with the difficult fact that obstacles are placed in the way of countries such as those in Central America in whose agreements certain clauses have been included , while we do not act in this way in other regions .
There is , without doubt , a great need to clarify the existing differences between the asylum procedure , reception conditions , the interpretation of the definition of a refugee , the links between that asylum procedure and the ' Dublin mechanism ' procedures and other forms of protection and , in this respect , this document perfectly focuses the debate .
We are all aware that the principle of solidarity requires a distribution of the consequences stemming from the current asymmetry in requests for asylum .
Mr President , I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur , Patsy Sörensen , for the care and accuracy of her report .
Mr President , I welcome the Commission communication on victims of crime in the European Union , since it studies the process of creating common policies , as well as greater cooperation between the Member States at a time when we are all aware , including this Parliament of course , of the need for this type of communitisation .
To sum up , they should be guaranteed full protection and , for that purpose , I am convinced that it is absolutely essential to cooperate with the NGOs and associations in the sector in every Member State .
However , I would like to highlight the importance of this report and Mrs Sörensen' s cooperation .
This is because , today , there are still genuine obstacles to the perfection of the internal market , genuine obstacles to the four freedoms laid down in the Treaty , precisely because we do not have a clear legal basis .
With regard to the Intergovernmental Conference , it is important that President Herzog appears before the European Council in Feira .
In this regard , I will add two decisive points .
After the political change which has taken place , the Commission should intensify the negotiation of the association agreement with Croatia .
However , our Union goes beyond the field of the economy .
Therefore , we have to demand of our Heads of Government and of the European Commission that they take the responsibility which the circumstances demand of the European Union , by increasing our joint political presence , of course , but also in the economic field , concluding the associations agreements once and for all , and implementing the Barcelona agreements more quickly .
The institutional questions of the Intergovernmental Conference are enormously important , but they do not reach the people .
With regard to the case of Austria , we understand that , firstly , the European Parliament ' s resolution , which was voted for at the time , is still in force , since no new events have occurred ; because it is not a Community issue as such , but has been raised by the fourteen Member States ; because , furthermore , my Group supported President Klestil ' s appearance and we took good note of his positive proposals , which are in fact related to issues which come within the competence of the Commission - which is not present - such as the application of Article 7 and the strengthening of our community of values .
It is therefore worth remembering that regional and structural policy in the European Union as a whole is a response to the specific disadvantages confronting certain European regions and , in particular , the outermost regions such as Madeira , the Azores , the Canary Islands and the French overseas departments .
These figures should lead us to consider the fact that , while the level and quality of life in the poorest regions is increasing , we have not managed to reduce the disparities between the richest and the poorest regions of the European Union .
The respect for democratic values is , and must continue to be , the central pillar of political dialogue between the European Union and the countries of Mercosur , both on a regional level and on a bilateral level .
Clearly , the bad news is that democracy is once again being threatened , but there has also been good news : the democratic forces have resisted and , furthermore , General Oviedo has been arrested in Brazil .
