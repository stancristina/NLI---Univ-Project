In other words , there are complex factors involved that have to be considered when dealing with this issue .
As piecework , for example , is on the increase at present , this will be reflected in the fact that pension cover will decline in value .
Mr President , Commissioner Bolkestein , ladies and gentlemen , the simpler legislation for the internal market initiative is one of the most important processes now underway in the Union .
At least for my party in Finland , the National Coalition , the streamlining of legislation and an end to the needless churning out of directives became one of the main objectives in the last European Parliament elections .
The Commission communication on the present state of the SLIM project is very gratifying , but by no means fully adequate , as yet .
I warmly support our rapporteur ' s proposals that the users of the legislation - the customers of our decision makers - should be heard more than they have been when concrete proposals are being drafted .
We do have debates on speeding up the legislative process from time to time here in Parliament .
In principle , I take a positive view of such proposals , although it is notoriously difficult for us parliamentarians to relinquish power .
I believe that the relinquishment of power in certain respects will be inevitable to remove the final barriers to the internal market as soon as possible .
In no case should it be an imitation of the present comitology procedure , where there is a very great need for reform , especially in the area of transparency .
Whatever the Commission proposes in its paper will determine how quickly new projects for legislation are dealt with , and , how effective the Union is as a whole for a long time ahead .
Mr President , Commissioner , education is assuming an ever more important role in the European strategy .
We need Europe-wide cooperation and encouragement in all areas of education .
Systematic quality evaluation in education is still in its infancy in many EU countries .
A report on the subject prepared in Helsinki last week shows that evaluation is not yet adequately systematic in nature , although it has got off to a brisk start .
Education cannot just be looked at from the limited point of view of competitiveness .
Well-organised education means that national resources are being put to the best possible use .
Education is not just about information and skills gathering , but also personal development , in the shape , for example , of a healthy sense of self-worth .
It is a positive sign that a common position on the quality evaluation of school education is ready to be approved so quickly .
We are making good progress with this important issue .
These three countries have rendered account in the budget of their customs duties , i .e . own resources , to a much greater extent proportionally than other countries .
In many countries abuses have been revealed , although there is no mention of countries ' names .
If they are not guilty of covering up crimes and protecting criminals , they are , nevertheless , the object of suspicion , as the countries ' names are not mentioned .
Huge volumes of goods pass through the European Union , which are then shipped outside the Union from its ports .
It is difficult to assess the extent of this , but the size of the damage caused to the Union is estimated to be between one and five billion euros .
Every night contraband tobacco is taken by 50 or 70 speedboats from Montenegro to Italy from where it is distributed to EU markets free of customs duty or tax .
Support and venture capital while a company is being set up are enormously important for the creation of jobs , as , according to certain studies , SMEs use as much as 80 % to 90 % of venture capital market resources in taking on staff .
We must give SMEs that have potential for growth our strongest support , irrespective of what sector they operate in .
Also great in this regard are the expectations connected with harmonising systems of guarantees and legislative reform regarding mortgages , which we are expecting in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
Finally , I would like to focus attention on those legal provisions which aim to make it easier for bankrupt companies to begin trading again .
I would also like to stress how important small businesses are for competitiveness with regard to Europe ' s big companies .
Mr President , Commissioner , on behalf of the European Liberal Democrats I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the rapporteur for his excellent work .
Many thanks indeed go to him , then .
The report takes excellent account of the problems of young farmers .
The problem that has come about is what is referred to as the hundred-hectare solitude factor .
It must be financially feasible to sustain the change-of-generation system .
It would be very important if we could get young people to continue in a profession that is important to us all .
Young farmers are very skilled and are not prejudiced about using modern technology in their work in the fields and in rearing cattle .
We are on the threshold of great change , which the rapporteur brought to our attention here , and it is the young , if anyone , who are best equipped to lead us through this revolution , which we will inevitably have to face within a few years .
Bureaucracy must not become a barrier to improving the position of young farmers .
Until now that openness has been missing .
In this connection we clearly have to adopt
