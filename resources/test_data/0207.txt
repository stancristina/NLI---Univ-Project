by the social fund and financing of specific guidelines , mainly those directed at human resources , and we believe that , for the area of enlargement in particular , for the new countries which will be called on to participate in the implementation of the procedure , but with reduced resources , the social fund can play a very important part .
I shall start by saying that I think it is very important that both the Commission and Parliament agree that there are huge differences between the institutional frameworks in the Member States and thus it is not possible for us to talk about the need to harmonise legislation and practices between the states in the field we are examining today .
I would highlight the need , to which Mr Menrad also refers , for national practices and national legislation to follow a series of principles , the most important of which is the need to minimise the financial risks to employees .
The report concludes with specific proposals calling on the Commission to conduct a comparative performance analysis between countries and models , to undertake studies on the forms of participation which are most suitable for small and medium-sized enterprises , where the problems are different , and to proceed to draft a paper on trade union and management aspects , attaching , of course , special importance to the issue of gender equality .
That is why both in the European Commission and in the plan for 2003 , which is the year against discrimination , the dimension of sport as a means of combating discrimination is very intensely promoted , and in 2004 , which is the year of sport , the plan being drawn up takes account of the issue of discrimination .
There is your proposal to create a 'women and sport ' unit .
There is a margin and I think that we can progress further by improving information for sports associations and increasing awareness of the possibilities within the framework of existing Community programmes , for which there is minimal to no demand from sports-related associations and programmes .
However , one sure way of increasing the interest of the Member States and the sports associations is to promote sport for women as a means against discrimination .
This report is particularly important and valuable in the run up to the 2004 Olympic Games and we hope that the proposals which it contains will be taken into serious account by the Athens 2004 organising committee .
The media need to be encouraged to positively reflect and adequately cover the breadth , depth , quality and benefits of women and girls working in sport ; and , finally , support is needed to achieve the standards of equality between the sexes laid down by the International Olympic Committee in 1998 and the practical application of everything included in the Thessaloniki declaration , which closed the work of a large international conference held within the framework of the Greek Presidency .
Mr President , this is not the first time Mrs Jöns has brought as serious a matter as combating breast cancer into the limelight in a very specific and efficient manner and it is important and proves yet again that the commitment and systematic work of one person can set policies in motion .
I think it is important to repeat them so that we understand the size of the problem . 220,000 new cases a year , 75,000 women who die from this disease .
It is important to say that many of the elements and proposals formulated emanate from the various actions undertaken by the Commission between the years 1987 and 2002 within the framework of three successive ' Europe Against Cancer ' programmes .
The proposal for a recommendation on cancer screening issued on 5 May .
Essentially it contains a proposal for measures which aim to correlate screening practices with the results obtained in the various Member States .
In addition to the proposal for a recommendation which , as I said , was the second basic element of the European Union 's policy after the inventory of the existing situation , the third important element is the action programmes .
The Commission has undertaken a major action which relates to the public health programme for the years 2000-2008 .
Of course , some of them are also pan-European in range .
This is in keeping with paragraph 13 of Mrs Jöns ' report and , of course , it recognises and supports the need for common strategies and actions in sectors such as research and technical equipment and technological development , which is also in keeping with paragraph 6 of the report .
I should like to express a slight hesitation as to the possibility of its being organised within the framework of the Italian Presidency , given that there is not much time , but of course we can try and find the best possible time .
Mr President , I should like to close by thanking Mrs Jöns on behalf of Mr Byrne , who was prevented from coming by very important commitments , for her particular contribution to the implementation of our common objective and to congratulate her warmly .
And I should also like to ask the European Commission to look as this , because , as the data which the Commissioner and other honourable Members referred to show , one in eight women is afflicted by this serious disease , which mainly afflicts women between the ages of 35 and 55 .
The proposal contains special rules for controls on meat , shellfish , fisheries products and milk and dairy products , but of course the debate focuses on the problem of meat inspections .
In other words , it concerns both the business and the public authorities
