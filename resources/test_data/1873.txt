I regret that Mr Romagnoli has not presented this amendment within the time limit allowed for such presentation according to the Rules of Procedure , but if the other Members support it , I have no objection to accepting an oral amendment tomorrow in plenary .
If the judiciary in each of the Member States is independent and partial , then that is the best guarantee we can have ; there are certain countries that do not recognise any privileges , there are at least two or three that do not recognise them .
This debate on such an important issue is being eclipsed by the problem we are facing in relation to the City of Strasbourg , which benefits greatly from having the European Parliament there twelve weeks per year .
This debate is very important .
Instead , I would ask you , before the vote , to consider the possibility of the referral of your report back to the Committee on Budgetary Control , which has not been able to deal with it today , precisely because it was plenary that could decide on it ; but to ask plenary to return it to us before recording a negative vote , which means something different : voting no to something without having clarified why we are voting no .
The former is a question of resources and priorities and the latter , of focus and justification .
I would like to thank the rapporteur for her report , which has allowed us to move forward on these issues , and I hope that we can still achieve new consensus in plenary .     Mr President , Commissioner , I would like firstly to thank the rapporteur for her work , which has been really excellent , and congratulate her , as well as the coordinators who have acted as shadow rapporteurs for the main groups .
As Mr Titley has explained very well , we must help the drivers and passengers of vehicles .
We have therefore asked for the inclusion of this kind of vehicle , and in particular their drivers and passengers , to be studied as soon as possible , since they are of great importance to us .
The choice of these five languages for the first stage should not prejudice the other European languages , but it should represent the beginning of a process , without ruling out the possibility of including other languages during subsequent stages , of course .
My only proposal is to take the section of Mr Fatuzzo’s amendment that I am going to read and move it to paragraph 35 , which is a more appropriate place for it .
Historically we have been enslaved , but we have never enslaved anybody else’s family ; we are inclusive , we fight for unity while respecting the diversity of other peoples and when , thanks to the conscience of my people , we won the Presidency as indigenous people , it was not through a sense of revenge , but through our peoples ’ sense of hope .
At the end of this month nearly 2 000 people will have completed their literacy studies .
We are therefore going to continue with our campaign for identification : in less than two months we have provided almost 50 000 new documents free of charge and we are going to go on to provide one or two million people with documents free of charge .
I felt great respect and admiration for the President when he mentioned our ancestors ’ cosmic law , the , which is the law of the original indigenous peoples : not to steal , not to be weak , not to lie .
And now , in this new millennium , my government and the Bolivian people must nationalise again , together with many social sectors , from both the countryside and from the city .
Any company that has invested in the country has every right to recover their investment and has the right to make profits , but not to control , and they will therefore be partners and not owners of our natural resources .
The industrialisation of natural resources is important .
I would like to tell you that we original indigenous people do not have a culture of cocaine .
I have looked closely at the history of coca in Europe .
Policies of eradication with financial compensation and then eradication by military force have left much to be desired in terms of human rights and the only way to put an end to that confrontation is for coca production to be controlled by the farmers ’ movement itself , to be rationalised and in that way to make the fight against drug-trafficking effective .
I would like to take this opportunity , through you , to tell all of the nations of Europe of my respect and admiration for the European Union .
Thanks to this political movement , which has emerged from the historically most scorned and hated sector , the sector that has suffered most discrimination : the original indigenous people .
We are all fighting for legal security , but to that end it is important that we have social security , that we have health , education , housing , employment .
And defending human rights in Bolivia means creating sources of work , health and education , and recovering our natural resources .
We only have a section with Peru , but we do not have a hard road with Chile , or with Argentina via Potosí , or via Tarija , or via Brazil .
That is my great wish and that is what we are fighting for .
I believe that it is important to take up initiatives and proposals that come
