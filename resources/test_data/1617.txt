A framework decision is legally binding upon the Member States .
For a country like Sweden , which has no constitutional court , the rule of law aspect is especially sensitive .
The Swedish Christian Democrats have today voted in favour of the Marinho report .
We consequently believe that it is wisest initially to have a limited area of application for the framework decision .
We are basically well disposed towards the European Union .
Because subsidiarity is something we defend and to which we adhere as one of our most important principles , we see no reason to harmonise the area to which the report relates .
In a way , every meeting prior to Johannesburg is the cause of ever increasing depression .
Rather than end up in the doldrums we are now experiencing , I should like in a way to have seen the banner kept flying a little higher en route from Gothenburg to Johannesburg .
The Commission has done an excellent job and done as much as it could .
It seems a bit pointless simply to tag along to Johannesburg as a kind of icing on the cake .
It is not enough to say that the people of the world need water .
These are , in a way , the lynchpins .
That much is obvious .
This is in extreme contrast to the incredible pressure put on us by the United States precisely to seek common solutions in the fight against terrorism .
I appreciate that the poor countries are looking for more aid , more support and better trade regulations , but I believe it is very important also to realise that more money alone will not lead to sustainable development .
That applies to agricultural , trade and fisheries policies .
If , however , they were to obtain access to energy under conventional conditions , that would lead to major damage to the environment and climate .
Let us remind ourselves of the difficult position from which we are in actual fact starting , with , first of all , a quite different political climate than that which prevailed when the Rio Summit took place .
There was a very long wish-list covering every political area imaginable , and a poorly focused political agenda .
Against that background , it is important not to ignore what has been achieved .
Nor must we forget the negotiations on climate change , which also collapsed at a certain phase but which could be resumed and made to yield a satisfactory result .
It is therefore very important that we now prepare ourselves for our role as bridge builders .
These are areas which we have already discussed and in which we have already done some preparation , but we need to see what progress we can make when it comes to grants , trade , access to our markets and development aid .
We need to ensure that we can preserve the status of environmental issues in the debate .
What , finally , will happen if Johannesburg fails ?
I want to thank you again for this important debate .
Mr President , Commissioner , I do not normally praise the Commission but , on this occasion , I wish to do so both in view of the Green Paper , or the follow-up to the Green Paper to which you refer , and also in view of the fact that we are soon to have the opportunity to cooperate within the 'enforcement sector ' in the matter of consumer protection .
What is to happen concerning the proposal for a regulation on sales promotion measures ?
There are three parts to the question .
The standard for multimedia home platforms ( or MHPs ) fulfils the requirements for operational compatibility and transparency in this area .
We anticipate the list 's being published this autumn .
According to the directive , the Member States must also carry out a review of operational compatibility and user options before July 2004 .
The second part of the question is as follows : How does the Commission intend to organise the dialogue in connection with such a migration ?
We have therefore taken measures to give some impetus to the dialogue .
Finally , we have asked the standardisation body , CENELEC , to carry out a preliminary investigation of the standardisation of digital TV and interactive TV services .
I am very well disposed to participation by MEPs and consumer groups .
It is a process which shows that the Commission is following up the commitment it made in the December plenary .
I am also pleased that you indicated the timetable for publication of the standard .
May I ask the Commissioner if the issue of digital TV is in some way to be touched upon again before Seville ?
I personally believe that digital television will play a major role in the information society in the longer term because the Internet must also be available via television if we really want the whole population to use it .
Mr President , Mrs Hautala really deserves the recognition she is receiving today .
We know that it is women who all too commonly suffer harassment of this kind .
I am also particularly delighted that the right to parental leave is being strengthened , and for women as well as men .
I should nonetheless have preferred clearer wording concerning people 's right to return to the jobs they had before taking parental leave .
That only applies , however , if this right is established in the Member States ' legislation .
A lack of will and understanding is revealed when our political ambition collides with employers ' absolute unwillingness to reflect upon their role when it comes to low birth rates in the European Union .
It is good that these changes are coming about , establishing
