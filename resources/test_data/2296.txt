I should like , however , to close by commenting that many who speak of the need for a common foreign policy or common security or defence policy consider that what must of necessity emerge from these procedures are decisions or positions which correspond absolutely to their creed and their positions .
With the exemptions and its limited scope , it is being reduced to a 'fig leaf' for monopoly interests , in that it does not include overall protection of biodiversity , oil pollution , nuclear damage , non-ionising radiation , GMOs etc . and provocatively exempts from liability charges those who cause huge ecological damage through unprovoked and barbaric military interventions .
These negotiations are now in their final stage .
If we are today in a position which allows me to be optimistic about the outcome of these negotiations , that is also largely due to the important efforts of previous presidencies .
The Presidency , I would remind you , has informed the European Parliament on the state of negotiations with the United States of America several times ; in fact , the last time , we had the opportunity to inform the LIBE Committee on 20 March .
The European Union will only be bound following the exchange of the legislative acts with the United States of America , which will consequently only take place once the Council has taken a second decision authorising the Presidency to exchange the legislative ratifying acts with the United States of America .
The Presidency believes that this agreement has added value in comparison with current bilateral agreements on extradition and mutual judicial assistance between the Member States of the European Union and the United States of America .
I must stress that , if we do not reach some sort of agreement , we shall have to live with the existing bilateral agreements which the Member States have concluded .
They will exist alongside bilateral agreements .
In addition , the draft agreement on extradition contains a provision which , as far as I know , has no precedent in international extradition law .
This provision does indeed allow the Member States to refuse to extradite a person in the case of special courts , if they do not have this right on the basis of their bilateral extradition agreement with the United States of America .
We managed to make a positive contribution to the current level of assistance , to improve efficiency and , most importantly , to agree on additional safeguards .
Contrary to what has applied to date in almost all bilateral extradition agreements , the non-execution of the death penalty by the Government of the United States of America will not depend on the assurances given in the case in question by the Government of the United States of America each time on an ad hoc basis , and will probably be put forward as a precondition by the Member State in receipt of an extradition request from the United States .
The Member States that wish to follow their bilateral practice will , however , be able to do so if they do not apply this provision and/or if they make a joint declaration at bilateral level with the United States .
When negotiations started , it was agreed by both the negotiating missions that the agreement would not have any repercussions whatsoever on the relative positions of the Member States and of the United States of America with regard to requests by the International Criminal Court for a person to be handed over .
The Member States which do not at present have an agreement on mutual judicial assistance with the United States of America can fall back on public order , security , national sovereignty or other interests of the state in receipt of the request in order to refuse to transmit information in some cases .
The draft agreement permits the use of modern means of telecommunication , facsimiles or e-mail in order to exchange requests for mutual judicial assistance and replies with express confirmation of receipt .
Mr President-in-Office , as you will understand , both the matter of the European prisoners in Guantanamo and the conditions they face and the matter of the transfer of confidential data to the United States on airline passengers give us cause for distrust and concern about the agreement and about the stand which the European Union will maintain .
Mr President , I have listened with particular attention and have noted the views , comments and observations expressing specific and justified concerns on the part of the Members of the European Parliament .
On the contrary , provision is made indirectly , not to say clearly , for referral to internal constitutional procedures .
So I would say that it expressly safeguards the right of each Member State to honour its obligations towards the International Criminal Court .
Now , as regards simultaneous extradition requests in relation to the European Arrest Warrant .
However , even if we decide under our own internal procedures in the future to give such priority to the European Arrest Warrant , the draft agreement contains a special provision which makes it easier for us to take such a decision .
The EU-USA agreements will bring added value .
I think that it is an achievement that the references both to constitutional principles and to public security etc . which have been included in both draft agreements are now express references .
Moreover , in the preamble to the drafts of both agreements being discussed , there is an express reference to the principle of a fair trial , including a hearing by an impartial , ordinary court , and to the question of special courts , which do not fit in with the judicial legal culture of Europe and are a matter that we raise at every meeting and in all talks with
