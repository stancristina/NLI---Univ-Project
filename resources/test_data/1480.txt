importantly , reality .     – Mrs Gastinger , Mr  Frattini , ladies and gentlemen , I should also like to begin by congratulating Mrs Hazan on her excellent report .
I should like to highlight three points : Firstly , I wish to reiterate the benefits that adopting the draft Constitutional Treaty would bring to this area of judicial and police cooperation , in particular the removal of the pillars .
The current trend is for the situation to worsen , with higher levels of unemployment , increased precarious and poorly-paid work , flexibility , the privatisation of core sectors and services .
Experience has taught us that the open coordination method provided for in the Lisbon Strategy has not reduced poverty .
The neoliberal policies at the root of the increased number of people at risk of falling into poverty must be reversed .
The fourth and last task will be to incorporate the financial regulation and the financial framework agreed upon in the Interinstitutional Agreement and to make them consistent .
It is therefore necessary to strike a balance between meeting social and economic needs and environmental sustainability , in particular by implementing appropriate social and economic measures to compensate fishermen for the costs of reducing their activities connected with plans to rebuild depleted stocks , especially those working in less well-developed areas .
It is crucial that we adopt methods to improve selectivity and , therefore , the possibility of catching fish at the right size , taking account of biology and the life cycle of each individual species .
Examples of this include the proposal initially put forward by the Commission for rebuilding fish stocks of southern hake and lobster and the most recent proposal on recovery of European eel .
I do feel , however , that much remains to be done , in the autonomous region of the Azores and in all Community waters , as regards these more environmentally-friendly methods .
Ladies and gentlemen , I share the widespread disappointment in the House that President Mahmoud Abbas has not been able to deliver his address here .
I wish to point out that nobody has helped the Palestinian people more than the European Union .
A new social policy agenda is also required , with a view to developing a society ...     – Mr President , Mr Barroso , I wish to make just a couple of points .
The Council , the Commission and Parliament must act quickly to reach agreement .
The agreement provides for benefits for both sides , and safeguards a sustainable fisheries policy in the FSM.
As we pointed out in 2001 , the Commission put forward proposals on the pretext of the fight against terrorism that advocated the supranationalisation of crucial aspects of justice , thereby sidestepping necessary cooperation between Member States and existing legal instruments such as extradition .
The rapporteur criticises these decisions and supports the activation of the ‘ ’ referred to in Article 42 of the EU Treaty , thus integrating the European arrest warrant in the first pillar .     .
We voted in favour of this resolution on forced prostitution , which recognises the reality of the situation in Germany and the need to take the opportunity presented by the World Cup to condemn the trafficking of human beings and prostitution .
Hence our struggle for social inclusion and for the rights of all women to dignity .
It is clearly unlikely that the victims of these processes would believe in the virtues of 'creative destruction ' .
Our objective should consist of endeavouring to make the most of this time for our economies and for our citizens , and this is the project on which our efforts should be concentrated .     .
I wholeheartedly back the Bauer report , which commends the measures put forward by the Commission aimed at helping the Member States to recognise the difficulties facing people at a disadvantage and to support the integration of such people , to boost job creation , training and career development , the reconciliation of professional and family life and the right to equal access to healthcare and decent accommodation , and to ensure the sustainability of social protection systems .     .
I should like to reiterate the importance of these measures for fishermen ; making any economic activity more environmentally-friendly is in their interest because it would guarantee healthy fish stocks to them .
The motion for a resolution before us offers comments and suggestions on the four priority action areas , which I wholeheartedly support .
Given that poverty is a violation of human rights , greater attention must be paid to its causes .
The captains of industry will set out their wish list calling for the implementation of the so-called structural reforms , which is a euphemism for the politics of the Right , the true meaning of which is well known to the workers : that is , more precarious work , lower salaries , longer working life and working hours , later pensionable age , the dismantling and subsequent liberalisation and privatisation of public services , with the accent on energy and communications , social security , health and education , and research , with exploitation , unemployment and poverty following in its wake .
These points have certainly not led me to vote against the resolution , but they do reinforce my disappointment at the lack of commitment to EU reforms .     – The Commission ’s initiative to review the regulation on mergers is a welcome one .
How does the Commission envisage regulating the power of the European oligopolies ?
This is particularly the case if we assess the impact on sustainability of the Euro-Mediterranean free trade zone , which we want to see up and running by 2010 , as the Commissioner pointed out .
