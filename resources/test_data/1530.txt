Doing so is important in that a number of problems remain to be solved during the last months of the year .
As I see it , that is absolutely the most important outcome of the conciliation .
As early as the beginning of next year , these countries will be able to send observers to what will also become their own Parliament .
Secondly , it is a question of implementing the necessary reforms .
It has shown a readiness to listen that has not always been characteristic of the Council in this context .
When the Council has cut back on jobs in other institutions , it has not cut back on jobs within the Council itself .
Mr President , Commissioner Verheugen , I note that I was not really given an answer to the question asked because it was of a hypothetical and speculative nature .
I am certain that the Commission must be thinking along such lines .
In my question , I pointed out that Finland , Sweden and Austria in actual fact negotiated their way to a practical solution to the problems before these countries were Member States .
Mr President , thank you for that information we have received from the Commission .
Mr Hughes has already addressed this matter , but it is important for it to be clarified .
Two processes are discussed , but I believe that three processes need to be talked about , namely the economic process , the employment process and the process of social inclusion .
I wonder therefore what thought has been given to the way in which , when the processes are coordinated , it might be possible to retain the special character of each particular one .
Those in Sweden who belong to the same political group as Mrs Smet usually maintain that the social agenda is not something for Europe but that social policy is a matter only for the individual Member States .
I usually put forward Mrs Smet 's view .
Like Mr De Rossa , I approve of what happened in Lisbon .
It is therefore good that there are MEPs who wish to go beyond party boundaries in promoting the social aspects , and I wish again to congratulate both the Commission and Mrs Smet on their work .
It has meant that we have been able to develop cooperation in new areas .
The social agenda is important in another perspective too , namely people 's willingness to take the EU project to heart .
His regime is evil .
As Commissioner Patten said , the world would be a much better place without Saddam Hussein and with a different regime in Iraq .
We must , of course , use all diplomatic and political means in order to get Saddam Hussein to comply with UN resolutions and allow the inspectors in and in order to solve this issue .
What discussions have been taking place in the Council ?
I am absolutely convinced that these issues were discussed in Elsinore , and I would therefore be grateful if the President-in-Office of the Council could say something about them .
All countries must comply with international law , including Iraq and - lest we forget - the US.
Naturally we must demand that the weapons inspectors be allowed back unhindered .
We want peace in the Middle East .
The sanctions currently in place against Iraq , and which have been in place for 12 years , have brought enormous suffering to the Iraqi people .
A war such as that currently being prepared will , of course , undermine world peace and security .
' Yes ' to weapons inspectors , but ' No ' to war against Iraq !
I have a few reservations about some of the details , but on the whole it is an exceptionally good report .
Something we ought to develop further is cooperation in the area of foreign policy , i .e . the EU should join with Asia in adopting a committed role in conflicts around the globe and play a more active part .
We have a lot in common and we have the same viewpoints .
We must also continue to cooperate on human rights issues , an area in which it has - quite rightly - been said that many of these countries have considerable problems .
Although there were differences between us , I must say that the atmosphere was good .
What I would stress above all with regard to the fight against terrorism is that it must be conducted under the auspices of the UN and within the framework of international law .
It is important that we should all ratify the Kyoto Protocol .
More cooperation is needed in this area .
As Mr Ford said , it is important to have continuity in our relations at government level .
It would be helpful if Mr Haarder could deny that this is the case and state clearly that no one has yet been turned away from the Danish border during the Danish presidency .
Consequently , another ' No ' vote from the Irish people cannot be ruled out .
That way , there would be no problem with the Treaty of Nice .
In the past , I have even seen a situation where the Council was given one answer and the Commission another , and they play on the fact that the presidency changes .
At the same summit where this agreement was not signed , Russia was still accepted as a market economy .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Friedrich , citizenship must be seen as a contract between the state and the individual , in which the parties recognise mutual rights and obligations .
The need for EU citizenship has become fully obvious in the light of the necessary restrictions on individual rights that followed the 11 September
