This is what we are planning to do , and I should like to ask the Commissioner whether she could not ensure that a uniform , Community method of measurement be established for this kind of noise , for that is still not available .
Instead of a general ban for the whole of Europe , the European Commission now wants each airport to document the fact that it does not want these noisy aircraft .
At the same time , Europe 's Christian , or post-Christian , society must re-affirm its own , moral identity , this with the intention of being better able to protect its own values , and of understanding what is happening in the rest of the world , or what is happening with the 2.5 million Muslims who live in the European Union today .
It is in English , and I think that he is right and that it should determine our attitude too .
This is incorrect .
Cooperation always leads to better results .
It is a source of violation of human and women 's rights and fundamental freedoms , as enshrined in the international treaties and conventions , and exercises its baleful influence not only directly , but also via religious rules , cultural characteristics , customs , political campaigns and social standards .
In this way , the tragedy caused by the Taliban , as well as the solution to it , can be used in the fight against other forms of fundamentalism .
This report is also praiseworthy for the fact that it expresses the wish that in the future directive on procedures for granting asylum in the Member States , account should be taken of various forms of female persecution .
The report tips towards a similar kind of intolerant fundamentalism to that which it means to fight .
Motherhood is , by definition , not a purely personal matter , if nothing else because children develop their own personalities .
In fundamentalist societies in particular , women are often denied fundamental rights and freedoms , and often have no access to adequate assistance , health care and education .
It is fair to call for the separation of church and state , but it goes on to prescribe requirements for the internal organisation of religious traditions .
In my view , this Parliament is not indifferent to the cause of health and safety , nor to objections concerning the implementation thereof .
The fundamental difference between noise and Vivaldi is as follows : in the music and entertainment industry , sound is the ultimate product , or at least an important component thereof .
I should like to thank the rapporteur for her clarity of vision .
The fourth point to which the Fisheries Committee would like to draw your attention is the implications of the dissonance which sometimes exists between bird and fish stocks .
We would welcome such an initiative from the Commissioner with open arms .
Action plans must be clear and , above all , concrete .
However , these pearls of nature preservation are in sharp contrast with other policy .
Member States should draft action plans for that purpose .
However , there are also products , certain vitamins and minerals , that are not without risk .
Rath drove the anxious citizen to action with false arguments , no less .
Anyone who can afford it is keen to buy good health .
I recently received 35 letters from anxious consumers .
Only latterly has the market grown and do high-dose tablets appear in the shops .
The Commission has laid down a solid foundation for the establishment of maximum safety levels for vitamins and minerals , and that also forms the basis for consumer confidence .
Since permitted quantities in tablets have in many cases been reduced , this will mainly have the effect that consumers will end up buying larger quantities of tablets in order to consume the same levels .
Given the numerous reactions , this is a considerable problem for many consumers .
This is why I shall be voting for rejection of the common position .
A few other MEPs have already mentioned this topic , and we have also discussed it with the Commissioner within the framework of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Security and Defence Policy .
Surely this can be done independently , and I also think it is important for our people to be able to distinguish between the truth and accuracy on the one hand and unfounded nightmares on the other .
Added to this , of course , is the fact that we have created our own problems by not reforming our own agricultural policy in time .
Mr President , needless to say , the fact that we are debating transatlantic relations today has everything to do with 11 September .
The first is the sharp increase in defence budgets by an amount which far outstrips the budgets of France and Great Britain put together .
The blurring of the line between nuclear and non-nuclear weapons is a dangerous development , and we all know that the threat of nuclear weapons would only hamper the search for solutions in Iraq or Iran , for example .
Mr President , the European Union is an economic superpower which is trying to carve a role for itself in the world .
As with the Islamic terrorist network of Al Qaida , President Bush is issuing serious military warnings to potential terrorist States .
Mr President , for Europe to be a force to be reckoned with on the international scene , without jeopardising its own security , it needs to make a credible defence contribution to NATO and to outline a coherent , viable Euro-Atlantic security concept as a matter of urgency , on pain of being ostracised internationally and of being isolated .
Mr President
