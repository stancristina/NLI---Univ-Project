One part of this is to improve the access of the citizen to the Court .
Another is for the Union itself to sign up to the European Convention .
Another is clearly for national parliaments and national political parties to find a reinforced role that they can play inside European Union affairs and to share the shouldering of responsibility to build European parliamentary democracy .
My group strongly welcomes the IGC and will be contributing to this Treaty reform process to the maximum possible extent .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and welcome the contents of this report .
It has caused me to reflect on two problems which have come to me recently in my own constituency .
Both concern cases with decisions pending before the Court of Justice .
The first relates to a large suspension bridge and whether or not tolls on it should be subject to VAT.
The decision could have huge implications for our local economy .
Secondly there is a lady within thirteen weeks of retirement who is desperate for news of a decision that will affect seriously her financial circumstances in old age .
These are just two examples of real life problems behind delays in Europe ' s system of justice .
Delays in justice can mean personal difficulties and even tragedy .
This is not to say that all of our own national systems of justice are perfect , but all too often they may be waiting for a preliminary ruling from the European Court .
Amongst the statistics there is a worrying upward trend in the time taken to deal with preliminary references .
This should not be taken as a criticism of the Court or of its staff , rather of the Court ' s structure and its lack of resources in a growing European Union .
The proposals in this report are very welcome as an interim palliative , but Europe is a legal construction , its courts are central to its proper functioning .
In the face of coming enlargement the IGC must deal with fundamental reform and restructuring of the court system .
Otherwise we will all , as elected representatives , be faced with more and more clamour from our citizens who are not getting access to quick and effective justice .
Madam President , I will add to the unanimity of the evening and say that I support the adoption of Culture 2000 and add my thanks to the rapporteur , Mr Gra√ßa Moura , who took over from our former colleague Nana Mouskouri .
Both of them have done a first-class job .
Alongside the debate we had earlier on in the day , culture may not seem that important , but it is ; and we have to be careful in the European Parliament not to allow the urgent to get in the way of the important .
Why do I say that culture is important ?
Well in simple economic terms , Europe ' s culture adds to genuine prosperity .
Where would Europe ' s tourism industry be without the richness of our culture ?
But , more importantly than that , cultural activities are what make mankind civilised .
Culture is at the root of our democratic beliefs ; and an uncultured society is not going to sustain tolerance and freedom and democracy .
Cultural diversity is important , and it is under threat .
However , it is not under threat from Europe .
Many people in my country say they see British culture being under threat , for example , from Portugal , from Germany , from Finland , for heaven' s sake .
We do drink port wine , and we do like German beer , and we even use Finnish saunas , but it is not from Europe that culture is under threat .
What I do see right across Europe is people drinking Coca Cola , eating hamburgers , wearing baseball caps , watching Hollywood films and often doing all this at the same time .
Now I do not believe that protectionism and regulation is the way of defending Europe ' s culture , but I do believe in lending a helping hand when we can .
That is what Culture 2000 is about .
So , I say to the Council of Ministers : Keep this programme genuinely under review .
Are we doing enough ?
And , I say to Madame Reding , thank you for the support and the help you have given so far , keep up the good work , we are on your side .
Mr President , this directive deals with the comparatively small but growing problem of abandoned cars and the question of a more structured disposal of all cars at the end of their life .
To that extent , it might be thought desirable , even if it is not a matter of urgent necessity .
The key questions now are who pays the EUR 262 per car for the 9 million cars that are disposed of each year ?
Who pays for the collection , the dismantling , the disposal and so on ?
And should the directive be retrospective to cover every car that has ever been made ?
The proposal from the Council , the common position , is that manufacturers should pay the lot .
That would mean billions of pounds or euros for each of the major companies in each of the countries of the European Union .
That cost would inevitably be passed on to the price and hence to the buyers of new cars .
Because European car manufactures have been operating here for many , many more decades than companies from Japan , Korea and elsewhere , that would be a much greater burden on the older European companies and a competitive gift to their competitors from elsewhere .
I commend Mr Florenz , Mr
