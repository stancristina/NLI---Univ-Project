through which Portugal committed itself to building that very same identity , and in particular our membership of Eurofor and of Euromarfor , which represented the first steps my country took towards actively participating in a common security and defence identity .
Now more than ever , with 25 Member States and 27 , 28 or even more in the future , if we start to work in a purely intergovernmental way – and I am weighing my words carefully , but I shall say this nevertheless  – it could spell the end of the European Union .
One eminent Member , Daniel Cohn-Bendit , advocated that Members should punish the Council , and should ‘shoot down ’ its candidate for President of the Commission .
I can promise you faithful adherence to the principles of transparency mentioned here by various Members , among others by the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe .
What better proof could you have of a non-dogmatic and a non-factional spirit ?
That is why I do not see the Lisbon Agenda simply as an agenda for competitiveness .
Let me repeat that I am a centrist reformer who wishes to work hand in hand with Parliament , and one who believes that Europe can be built with sufficient will .
We shall see what wins the day – fine words or having the courage to accept one 's responsibility .     Ladies and gentlemen , Mr President-designate of the Commission , Dr Durão Barroso , I wish you good luck .
You told us that you want a Europe based on solidarity .
I know you and can bear witness to your humanist approach and to your support for the values of the rule of law , but it is important to emphasise that we live in uncertain times , in times when there are quite rightly calls for increased security .
The history of our Community records that progress was always made when this relationship was at its most focused .
I was pleased to hear you saying yesterday that Portugal may be on the edge of Europe geographically speaking , but that it is nevertheless at the heart of Europe .
Turning to your specific questions , I have arranged my replies in clusters , something I am very much in favour of in such cases .
But we must also fight epidemics like AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis .
As a matter of fact , I am already preparing this work with Javier Solana , because I believe that there is work to be done here .
It is not the Commission that has to define the foreign policy of the European Union .
I shall accordingly try to respond to the questions put to me by Mr Wurtz , Mr Swoboda , Mr António Costa , Mrs Napoletano , Mr Wiersma , Mrs Frassoni , Mrs Gruber , Mr Paasilina , and all the others , by saying that in future , as President of the Commission – if I receive your endorsement – I shall attempt , as far as I possibly can , and working together with the Member States , to ensure that there is a common vision , something of which there has not been any sign amongst the Member States nor even , if we are honest , within our respective political families .
As regards relations with the United States , a question raised by various honourable Members , including Mr Swoboda , Mrs Mussolini , Mr Schultz and Mr Evans , I believe that it is important that the European Union should not define itself in terms of its opposition to any given country or region .
Mrs Grossetête , Mrs De Sarnez , Mr Martinez , Mr Mulder and Mr Belder in particular referred to Turkey .
That is vital as far as I am concerned .
We must therefore strengthen our relations with our immediate neighbours , because our own security and stability also depend to a large extent on our doing so .
Let me make myself clear and say that I do not just wish to be the Council 's candidate , although I am of course very honoured to have received the unanimous support of the Council , but if I am elected I will be the candidate elected by the Council and by this House .
That is why I do not stand before you here today as a Head of Government : I am simply a Member of the Portuguese Parliament .
As regards the debate about the future of Europe and about ratification – an issue raised by Mr Schultz , Mrs Grossetête and Mr Dehaene in particular – I would like to say that this is a debate that we have to win at national level , and all politicians , be they Members of the European Parliament , members of national parliaments or others , can take part in this debate .
I do not want to have just one super-Commissioner in my Commission – I would like to have 24 super-Commissioners , because I believe that there is a vital principle at stake here : the principle of collegiality .
I am committed to the Commission being open , effective and accountable .
I hope that the Commission will be able to provide Parliament with full information on these groups of experts and working groups on a regular basis .
I would like to consider with you how we can improve on the current situation .
Yesterday I said that I am determined to have a greater proportion of women Commissioners than has been the case up to now , but a number of women Members have asked me today exactly what my objective is .
Some of the most frequently asked questions were about economic and social issues , and in particular the issue of social cohesion and the Lisbon agenda
