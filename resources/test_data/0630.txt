Finally , allow me to express the Presidency 's satisfaction with the course of the summit that we have just had in Copenhagen - the ASEM Summit .
In addition to informal talks , concrete initiatives were put on the table which we will now work on further , including youth games staged in Asia .
We also want to strengthen links between Europe and Asia ; there are great opportunities for cooperation not only in the economic sphere , but also in the political and cultural spheres .
Before I hand over now to Mr Tassos Yiannitsis I would like to say that I agree with the report 's remarks on the EU 's successful work in the Balkans .
With the takeover of the UN police mission in Bosnia on 1 January 2003 the EU will make another substantial contribution to promoting stability further in the Balkans .
However , I have a number of problems with Mr Brok 's report .
Far too much weight has been placed on military security policy , while civil and economic security policy is left in the shadows .
You could say that the arena is now entirely open for us in this area .
It is our strength to move into this field .
Unfortunately my own country has helped to prevent some of these opportunities , for example by not wishing to be part of renegotiating the Association Agreement with Israel .
It is the Association Agreement that Israel is violating time after time .
Finally , with regard to Iraq : what is the evidence that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction ?
I have read them in detail .
There is not a shred of evidence .
It has been interesting to listen to the many speeches and points of view .
I am pleased that those are also the conclusions drawn in Parliament 's report and in Mr Brok 's speech .
The common foreign policy is in actual fact the rule rather than the exception .
It will succeed only if we listen to each other and bring about a consensus , but that is something we are all united in aiming for .
It is true that different foreign policy positions are expressed but , when we reach the point of taking the final decision on the common foreign policy , it is usual for us to do so jointly .
There is in fact consensus in these areas in spite of what is often a variety of public statements of our positions .
If , moreover , divisions are created in the EU , there is also a loss of influence .
It should nonetheless be emphasised that the EU has in actual fact become one of the leading actors in the efforts to bring about peace in the Middle East .
We have not in fact had such a plan before .
Moreover , the European peace plan also led , of course , to working parties and task forces being set up in July , and these have in actual fact progressively advanced the process of reform in the Middle East .
There have been workers who , in spite of everything , have been given permission to leave Palestine and work in Israel .
I acknowledge that my introductory speech was probably too optimistic , and I am sorry about that .
I also said in my speech , however , that the optimism I had felt had been shattered by the events of last week .
We can therefore choose to be pessimists and not do anything at all .
That way , you always turn out to be right .
Otherwise , we could not stand to go on working .
Has the European Parliament experienced anything similar before in the Middle East ?
Moreover , it has been brought about by virtue of constructive cooperation with Russia , the UN and the United States , whereby we do not seek sources of conflict but try to find the solidarity that will carry us through .
It cannot end in any other way .
That is why we constantly make powerful appeals to both parties .
We call upon the terrorists to cease their acts of terror and upon the Israeli army to halt its excessive use of force .
It is , moreover , the same message that Kofi Annan delivered to the UN General Assembly the other day , when he said that the peace process must be driven by hope and by deeds : deeds on the part of the Palestinians , aimed at genuinely halting the terrorism , and hope in the form of Israel 's really making it clear that the outcome will be a Palestinian state .
European policy , or the Council of Minister 's policy , is therefore quite clear and corresponds , then , to what is also global policy .
I talked for an hour the other evening with Mr Sharon about the pointlessness of maintaining the present siege .
This has been said quite clearly .
The main topic 's having after all been the Middle East , I want finally to say that the European position has also carried the day with regard to Iraq .
The European position is that the Security Council should be supported .
That also means , then - and this is the common position we adopted in Elsinore - that we must listen to the Security Council and be willing to accommodate its requirements of us .
There is no split in the European position as adopted by the Foreign Ministers .
It is also a position that has paid off , because the United States has of course also agreed to comply with , and consult , the Security Council .
I endorse Mr Titley 's concluding words to the effect that a lot has been done and that more needs to be done .
