the Commissioner and to the Swedish Presidency is this : are you prepared to carefully monitor the case of Yusuf Akbulut ?
I asked to speak in order to reply on behalf of the Council to the question which Mr Sacrédeus addressed to the presidency concerning religious freedom and tolerance between religions in Turkey .
We see this as an important element , not only in the partnership with Turkey but generally in Europe-Mediterranean cooperation .
Mr Sacrédeus also takes up the important issue of the trial of a Turkish priest .
The Council is monitoring this matter extremely carefully .
The strategy adopted in Lisbon is an important milestone in the development of the EU.
The outlook for the European economy is still good .
However , there is no room for complacency , as 14 million people in Europe are still out of work .
In Stockholm we should openly and critically assess the progress made in the last year .
Instead , the Stockholm European Council should highlight certain prioritised areas .
This also requires a commercial climate which facilitates investment and the establishment of new growth companies .
We aim to push on with reform of the financial markets , with regard to which the important Lamfalussy report will provide the foundation for discussions in Stockholm .
It is also a tool for increased consumer benefit - lower prices and a greater range and better quality of goods and services .
Expected demographic development in Europe poses a growing challenge .
It will also require measures to increase participation in the labour market .
The significance of improved conditions for families with children , increased equality and lifelong learning should be highlighted more clearly as means of meeting the demographic challenges .
I would also like to stress the vital importance which the successful development of economic and monetary union has for stability and welfare in Europe .
Mr President , it is sometimes said in the debate in my home country that the EU cannot be changed , but I think that the political agenda we are now discussing shows that change can be made .
This has come about via Amsterdam and Lisbon and is now continuing in Stockholm .
We do this partly through straightforward legislation in areas such as the work environment and labour law and partly through the open coordination method , which means establishing common targets for various matters .
It is important that there be a balance between these three areas , which are all vital to the process .
So let us focus on certain important issues so as to set the process in motion .
As this becomes increasingly important , we must have an Institutional Agreement in which the role of Parliament is strengthened .
This is the right ambition to have and must now be followed up effectively in Stockholm .
I must admit that we Liberals are taking a rather guarded approach until we see the results of the Stockholm European Council .
In this context the Council deserves the most criticism , but Parliament is also at fault .
Biotechnology must also be stimulated .
A more liberal Europe means a Europe with greater cohesion and greater social security , which means that people ' s willingness to take risks and dare to try new things increases .
As a Swede , I hope that the Stockholm European Council will be a watershed , where decisions will be taken which pave the way for a competitive and liberal Europe .
For example , my own country Sweden has in the past been a very egalitarian country .
California is turning dramatically left .
Are you now going to continue down the EU' s incorrect road towards deregulation fundamentalism ?
Mr President , I agree with Mr Bullmann when he emphasises a number of positive signals from the Lisbon Summit .
No, clearly not .
I naturally hope that , at the Stockholm European Council , the Swedish Government will highlight and prioritise the left-wing model which stresses the importance of full employment and a socially responsible development policy and rejects the trend towards liberalisation , deregulation , flexibility , etc .
This is not the same , so I request correction in all language versions .
This is not a stand for or against genetically modified products , but a way of regulating our current reality .
Consumers must be able to choose whether or not to buy GMO products .
We believe it is important to establish clear rules in this area .
At that time there was widespread support in the House for the Commission being forced to take this way of reducing regulation in Europe seriously .
This is why I believe it was important to keep to the approach decided by Parliament in 1998 .
- ( SV ) We believe that Parliament lacks the necessary competence to adopt a position on technical details of such a specific nature as in the case in question , although in principle we support the regulations which follow on from the proposal for a directive .
- ( SV ) We have voted against the report by Mrs Müller on food supplements .
Mr President , Mr Lipietz has written an excellent report which highlights two of the European Investment Bank ' s real weaknesses .
With regard to the area of environmental impact analysis , it is clear that the World Bank , for example , is better than the European Investment Bank at making analyses public before decisions are taken .
I would like to say that we support this excellent report and the amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens .
Mr President , may I then just add that I am extremely happy that I raised it , as this gave you the opportunity to provide a good excuse for the Swedish Presidency
