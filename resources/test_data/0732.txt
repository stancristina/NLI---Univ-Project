join in thanking the Presidency and , in particular , Mr Patten .
As Socialists , we argue that the Code of Conduct on arms exports must become binding , and that national and European legislation must be adopted with a view to increasing transparency in the activity of arms brokering .
With measures such as those identified in this Resolution – of which we voted in favour – and extending the binding enforcement of the Code of Conduct , not only to our partners in the enlarged Europe , but also to our new neighbours , so that there can be a common European arms market , in which the recently set up European Arms Agency plays a control and regulation role .
One resolution on the suitability of the arms embargo as a means of bringing about significant change cannot lead to a lifting of the arms embargo , at least for as long as there is no binding Code of Conduct on the export of arms and instruments that may be used for internal repression and torture .
There is , indeed , no heading allowing the direct award of Community funding to a Member State whose government does not have absolute authority over part of its territory .
I therefore deliberately left open the choice of the most suitable budgetary basis , a task that the Budgetary Authority must undertake once the Council has tabled its proposed text .
Nothing is guaranteed in the January elections .
Europe must therefore be on hand to monitor the entire electoral process , so that no doubt is cast upon its transparency .
It is vital to ensure the general public’s security and fundamental rights , mutual trust and the primacy of law throughout the EU.
An impressive body of legislation has been built up , but we regret that , as regards its transposition into national legislation , major shortcomings have come to light , in terms both of meeting deadlines and of the quality of transposition .
It is only by means of a common European asylum and immigration policy that we will be able to address problems such as illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings .
As regards the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy , we strongly criticise the Kok report on the interim review of the Lisbon Strategy , particularly in view of its emphasis on ‘competitiveness’ , on further increasing the flexibility of labour markets , on structural reforms in the internal market and on the liberalisation and privatisation policies , despite the disastrous impact that those policies have already had .
I voted in favour of the reports by Mr Gauzes on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments ( Andorra and Liechtenstein ) , because I believe that by promoting the internal market and fair competition , it does not harm the general public’s freedom , and by means of these and other mechanisms , helps in the fight against money laundering .     .
We welcome those agreements , not , as the rapporteur claims , due to barriers to the internal market , but because coordination is needed to tax capital and to combat tax have ns , not least when the     .
The ARGO programme under-performed in 2003 , due to the under-implementation of funds , which occurred firstly because the programme is not sufficiently well-known to national administrations and secondly because they have difficulties in mobilising the necessary co-financing .
In other words , this is yet another tool used to construct a ‘fortress Europe ’ built on restricting the fundamental competences of Member States’ sovereignty .
Another problem was the difficulties experienced by Member States , along with their partners from other Member States , in organising and mobilising the necessary cofinancing to carry out the projects .
We have no objection to this in principle .
I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Corbey ( A6-0027/2004 ) on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste .
The revised packaging directive does not therefore contain specific proposals for the acceding States in its operational part .
I welcome the rapporteur’s proposal based on the idea that all Member States should still be encouraged to implement packaging reuse systems , with the aim of achieving a high level of environmental protection and giving the new Member States a period in which to adapt properly .     .
I also wish to highlight the paradox of voting on the use of the agency for the practical implementation of a regulation     .
The European Agency for Reconstruction has , according to recent assessments , proved amply capable of carrying out the policy of assisting development in the Balkan region that is enshrined in the Community Assistance for Reconstruction , Development and Stabilisation regulation ( CARDS ) , and has achieved the objectives of its mandate .
Parliament cynically asks the Council to take an ‘impartial ’ decision .
Respect for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Republic of Cyprus must , therefore , be a prerequisite for any solution aimed at the ‘economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community’ .
The proposal for a Council regulation before us is intended to promote the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community , thereby giving practical form to the intention expressed in the Council Statement of 26 April 2004 ‘to put an end to the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community and to facilitate the reunification of Cyprus by encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community’ .
Indeed , the splintered nature of the threats against the free world , as illustrated by the tragedies of 11 September and 11 March , demonstrates that strict conditions must be placed on international arms sales , for the sake of overall security
