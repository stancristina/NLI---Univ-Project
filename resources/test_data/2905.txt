As for the financial perspectives – another major area for action during your Presidency – you want to restrict the Union’s budget to 1 % of GDP.
Let us not disappoint them .
I shall therefore endeavour to provide you quickly with all the information you need for the purpose .
That it can play the part of honest broker between the various institutions .
Then Mr Barroso tells us he wants to be an honest broker .
The Council has never adopted a proposal from this House as it stood .
He has amply demonstrated that in the exercise of his national responsibilities .
We really are not up to it .
I am convinced that our fellow citizens expect us to build that political union .
This crucial question has a bearing on the very nature of Europe and we therefore need to come out from behind the customary closed doors and hold a genuine debate .
Without penalising the old Member States , the budget must allow us to support the ten new countries and help to create the conditions for growth .
Put your trust in the European Parliament .
If some people here have referred to you as being the second choice , remember that Jacques Delors was also a second choice , but that he was one of the best presidents we have had ; that is what I wish for you .     – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like a different voice to be heard in this Chamber .
Your project is not equal to dealing with what is at stake for Europe and the world , or to making our fellow citizens ’ European dream a reality .     – Mr Barroso , you have not convinced us .
Now the problem with the centre is that they are opportunists .
Your actions as Prime Minister , and hence also as a member of the EU’s Council , have also shown us that , in economic and monetary matters , you have been so convinced a European that you kept very strictly to the Stability Pact and its principles .
Fortunately , and even though the effects of fires continue to be too serious and disastrous , the fires which have affected , in particular , the southern Member States of the EU this year have been less fierce , and there has been no summer heatwave causing thousands of deaths .
The Council has asked us for urgent procedure , and we regard that request as justified for the very simple reason that , as my grandmother used to say fifty years ago , you do not want to wait until the cows have gone before shutting the gate to the enclosure .
You are right to say that discussion of these issues is among our responsibilities .
Today , and to a large degree thanks to your efforts , we have a real dialogue between the institutions , which has made it possible for the Commission ’s legislative programme , from now on , to better reflect Parliament’s priorities , so the results of this ongoing dialogue are thoroughly encouraging .
We have the tools we need to do this , by which I mean the Council’s multinational programme and the annual programme as prepared by two successive presidencies .
There have been positive results , too , in relation to enlargement : the Commission has made a success of enlargement , but it has not been able to conduct a debate on Europe’s future borders , so it is that sort of debate for which we are still waiting , along with the debate on Turkey , which will , without doubt , be beset with perils for all of us .
In the preliminary draft Budget , we noted that there were significant increases in payments and commitments , which were necessary to the success of enlargement , and , now that we see these increases drastically curtailed , we know that the funding will not be there to enable the European Union to back up its promises .
It is perfectly clear what is going on : the figures have been adopted in an attempt to get a pseudo-draft accepted .
Could a start not be made on transposing the dozens and dozens of directives ?
Accordingly , the Commission cannot act except in order to add to and back up the action taken by sporting organisations and by the Member States .
Firstly , he suggests that there is a clear difference between amateur sport and professional sport .
We are not in a position to undertake any harmonisation action , nor to table a directive in this regard .
Against this backdrop , the fact remains that finally abolishing the quotas presents us with a challenge in terms of competitiveness to which we must be capable of responding , and this is what the Commission did last June by proposing action lines .
We shall therefore approach the end of the year deadline in full knowledge of the facts , but also with a toolbox that has recently undergone significant improvements .     There are , of course , several levels .
Once the quotas have disappeared , there will still be both the tariff level – which , as I have mentioned , is to be the subject of fresh multilateral negotiations , the principles of which , moreover , were set in Geneva last July – and everything we refer to as non-tariff barriers , in other words technical barriers that are also on the multilateral negotiation agenda .
Not only are the USA and Europe – particularly France , which has a major influence in the region – implicated in this situation , but so are China and a number of Asian countries .
In this context , the role we can play is that of
