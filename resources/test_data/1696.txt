had a chance of normal life .
It did not manage to send observers to the elections .
This is evident from the Eurostat statistics .
Rather , they lay down principles for relations between the contracting parties in the fisheries sector , define common aims and provide for the distribution of powers , for reciprocal access to catch areas and for the possibility of the Baltic states granting additional catch rights to Union fishermen in return for financial compensation .
I am grateful to the Commission for providing me with the information promptly .
You know that Slovenia elected a new parliament on Sunday in a spirit of great plurality .
The economy has grown to an extent that raises hopes that Slovenia can soon become a full member of our Union .
I would like to have a debate one day at which all the group chairmen are here and give their views and say : yes , we support this kind of programme .
But surely one should not intervene in a flourishing market by imposing an organization of the market on it !
Mr President , first I want to thank Mrs Larive for her excellent report that was presented here today .
It is central to our concept of social policy .
But quotas do encourage young working women in particular to enter the political arena .
I also regret the fact that many men are often not interested in this important question .
Is it not a little late in the day to send observers after disaster has already struck ?
I should like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy for his efforts in past years .
So we asked Mr Duisenberg that question : would he also be a candidate for the European Central Bank ?
I asked her why .
I have no doubt that Mr Duisenberg will be one of those individuals , and I am convinced that this very important appointment decision that we are taking today will also be a right decision !
The same applies to the dialogue with this European Parliament and the Subcommittee on Monetary Affairs , and it will also be necessary to document this democratic accountability , with the European Central Bank bringing transparency to the justification of monetary decisions , with a guarantee of the complete independence of that institution .
Shortterm cosmetic operations to enhance the next budgets , the budgets that will be used to assess readiness to join monetary union , must be avoided .
I would like to make that absolutely clear on behalf of our group .
That means , obviously , that we must talk to the main players about the form that dual pricing is to take , to make it as clear as we can to all concerned that prices are not going to change because of the Euro and the introduction of the single currency .
We constantly refer to these objectives as our highest priority , without really suiting the action to the word .
The much vaunted freedom of establishment would become transmuted into a constant pressure to migrate to the current centres of economic activity .
We had great difficulty in topping up the Fourth Research Framework Programme - we are still having difficulties , we have still not solved the problem .
Marble will be too cheap for them .
I should like to look at three separate points , three specific proposals made by the Desama report , which seem to us to be particularly important .
The issue here is the attempt to provide optimum cross-border links between the various carriers , and also to use them for cross-border travel .
The idea is to integrate the entire network , conceptually and technically , from the transEuropean networks to the local transport systems .
They must be involved in comprehensive , clearly structured consultations .
Many families do not have a car .
For one thing , they clarify the categories and make a clear distinction between those services that do require authorization and those that do not ; and they also clarify the procedure for taking due account of the technical control of the vehicles - safety , in other words , and social aspects .
But we Christian Democrats must also emphasize that we take the principle of subsidiarity in the Union seriously .
So this sector should be protected against excessive upheavals by the prior introduction of unambiguous regulations covering the granting of concessions for short-distance public transport services .
No doubt it would be easier to leave the time unchanged throughout the year .
First , the principles of the pan-European transport policy , such as the social market economy and fair competition as organizational principles of transport policy , but , GÃ¼nther , and Commissioner Kinnock , we also need to review what progress we have made in implementing the results of Prague and Crete , because there is no point in constantly adopting more and more resolutions if nobody implements them .
Thirdly , there is a task which specifically faces us in the European Parliament and the other European institutions - the final establishment of European unity on a socially and ecologically sustainable foundation .
It is thus logical for us to hold a joint debate on the 1996 employment report and on the amendment to the European Union 's most important social insurance legislation - Regulation 1408 .
The Carlos Lage report indicates realistic opportunities for action , following up the requirement stated by Commissioner Wulf-Mathies and also , in his own field , Commissioner Flynn for a structural policy to benefit employment , and especially to benefit equality of opportunity , because as we known women are particularly seriously affected by mass unemployment .
Secondly , the dialogue between the social partners , the alliance for work and the Round Table are too valuable to be casually abandoned
