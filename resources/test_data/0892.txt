the EP , dating back to 1997 , to reach a Regulation on competition among ports has been completely overlooked .
The tendering of the cargo handling aspect will mainly lead to red tape .
Additionally , with regard to stem cell research , the guidelines drawn up by the ESF ethical committee must be observed .
We thought that that was the case , but that appeared not so .
In other words , is future involvement by the EU provided for in this UN peace-keeping force ?
I know that the European Union and the EU Member States , alongside UN representative Mr Brahimi , are involved in finding what you refer to as a stable government .
Madam President , Madam President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , I hope you will forgive me if I go over my speaking time by half a minute .
Finally , we must ensure that a government is put in place that respects human rights .
That is a total package .
The position of Syria has already been mentioned .
However , the proposals they have tabled contain too many loopholes .
This also requires more and better cooperation with the police and intelligence services , as well as better criminal investigation methods .
The deadly product that was used points , in terms of its concentration and purity , in the direction of laboratories in the United States itself which are reported to be the only ones in the world that could make the product .
The re-introduction of a temporary subsidy scheme goes against the agreements made and is unacceptable .
With this proposal , Europe places itself in an untenable position .
Separate support must be granted within the agreements we have concluded in this connection .
We now have an international bank account number , the IBAN , we have a bank identifier code , the BIC , the reporting requirements to the Central Bank have been lifted when amounts up to EUR 12 500 are involved , and that coincides with the permitted maximum of the money-laundering directive .
I would endorse this , but would at the same time express my astonishment about the fact that only a very small number of banks have joined the initiative .
I now have high hopes for the Internal Market Council reaching agreement on 26 November , something which the Ghent Summit called for .
Some banks , such as the Postbank and Internet banks , have their own codes and should not , therefore , be forced to use the IBAN and BIC codes .
A solution to the problem of cross-border payments is now really in sight , and that is surely something to be welcomed .
After all , we have launched the euro , so we are saddled with the problem .
We are not bankers and therefore do not know how bank charges should be calculated , nor do we want to know , in all honesty , for that is why we have bankers .
Self-regulation in the sector appears not to be working .
In fact , I also support all amendments which Mrs Peijs has tabled on behalf of our group .
Today , the euro is a virtual currency , especially for the citizens , but on 1 January 2002 , the currency will become tangible , for from that date onwards , 300 million Europeans will be using the same bank notes and coins .
As Mrs Peijs knows , I am a staunch Liberal , and I regret the fact that I had no choice but to propose such a binding document for the banks .
That is an important fact .
It is therefore illogical to demand withdrawal of the proposal just before the first benefits are becoming visible .
The bottom line in the ECB' s argument is that the banks need more time to set up the necessary infrastructure and logistical provisions .
That is why the European Central Bank proposes 1 January 2005 for the Regulation to come into force .
Moreover , in this connection , I should like to refer to the last speaker , Mrs Thijssen , who asked me whether it is possible for banks to compensate for the losses incurred with regard to international payments by national payments .
As it happens , the Commission has never wanted to promote the use of cheques and therefore agrees with the amendment .
I hope that second reading will be nothing but a formality , in which case the text will be ready for publication in January .
The first part of the amendment which the Commissioner mentioned remains unchanged , something which he , in fact , endorsed .
( NL ) Mr President , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , I would thank the Commission for the proposal on upward convergence of excise on tobacco .
I do not subscribe to the rapporteur ' s point of view that an increase in excise will , in itself , promote smuggling or , vice versa , that a reduction in excise will lead to a drop in the incidence of smuggling .
One of the reasons for change is the fact that the Member States miss out on a huge amount of excise on account of fraud and smuggling .
On the one hand , tobacco consumption is discouraged by warning labels , bans on tobacco advertising and higher excise , while on the other hand EUR 1 billion goes up in smoke in the form of tobacco subsidies .
In our opinion , the solution should fit into the line that the European Union has adopted in the transport sector .
We must also distinguish between short-term and long-term measures .
It is not national claims , but the market that plays a decisive role in respect of such rights
