This , more than anything , is what I ask of the Commission ; that it be capable of taking risks and that it set out the most adventurous , most daring and most incisive lines of action .
We also , therefore , endorse Mr Papadimoulis’s report – and I compliment him on his work – and we naturally support the Commission ’s proposal to extend the programme .
Coming from Portugal as I do , I am particularly sensitive to this issue , as you will understand .
We cannot forget that the Earth does not belong to us , it has been borrowed for our children .
There are sectors in which we cannot make savings .
Under what jurisdiction ?
The Commission argues that it is because there is insufficient scientific evidence to prove the evils of the technique .
All that brings us to the key issue of jurisdiction , starting with the simple omission of the national jurisdictions of Spain and Portugal , which was not omitted even in the previous proposal dealing with the United Kingdom’s jurisdiction over the reef formations of the Darwin Mounds off the Scottish coast .
Secondly , this balance was achieved when and where fishing was not industrial and predatory and the conservation of marine biological resources was under national and regional jurisdiction on the basis of proximity , and there are therefore no grounds to replace this jurisdiction in order to remedy incorrect or lax practices .
According to the Commission , protection is given to the areas around Madeira , the Azores and the Canaries , outermost archipelagos where the traditional fishing methods that have been used for centuries up to the present day have made it possible not only to preserve species but also to maintain thriving fishing communities .
Nonetheless , the proposed amendments to widen the ban on nets to include bottom gill nets make complete sense to me .
That is a backward step in nature conservation imposed by the Commission and by the European institutions , which makes no sense at all and is totally unacceptable .
The proposals put forward by the rapporteur are a step in that direction .
It helps to clarify the responsibilities of those political forces which deal out criticism but do not match it with action .
Failure of the negotiations on the enlarged EU’s first budget would have been a terrible political signal to send out to Europe’s citizens .
There is greater provision for regional and cohesion policy , as well as for the common agricultural policy with its pilot projects , and there are more funds for concluding agreements on fisheries .
Leaving aside positions of principle , it is unacceptable that that aid should be financed to the detriment of the European Union’s cooperation and development policy – in other words , at the expense of the less developed countries – just as it is also unacceptable that there should be no multiannual framework programme , as there was in the case of the Balkans .
In that time , the flexibility instrument has been used five times in a row , thereby justifying the Portuguese Communist Party’s proposal to review the current financial perspective .
I consider certain advances to have been positive , namely in the area of maritime safety ( particularly pollution ) and the maintenance of the framework of structural policies and external policies , especially in development aid ; I also welcome the special relationships with ACP countries .
As the Portuguese fleet has fishing opportunities for five surface longliners in that area , it is important that Portugal should support this extension and press for a favourable renegotiation of the agreement .
As I have already argued on other occasions , I think that the Union should gradually consolidate its competences and practices rather than try to satisfy a constant appetite for new competences .
I agree with that .
I voted for the report , of course .     .
I should like to congratulate Mr Papadimoulis on his excellent report on the proposal for a Council decision amending Decision 1999/847/EC as regards the extension of the Community action programme in the field of civil protection .
Given that the Community’s civil protection programme currently in force expires on 31 December of this year , I believe that it would be entirely appropriate for the programme to be extended for two years to fill the gap between the expiry of the existing programme and the entry into force of the new instrument .
Mechanisms at European level , such as the one created by the current programme , are therefore becoming increasingly justified .
Similar restrictions are already in place in an area of Northwest Scotland .
The deep-water habitats that the Commission ’s proposal is targeting were until recently protected from trawling (use of bottom trawl or similar towed nets operating in contact with the bottom of the sea ) , due to the special access regime laid down in accession negotiations .
Whilst I am not satisfied with the final result of the vote on the amendments , I wholeheartedly welcome what this report has achieved , and therefore voted in favour .     .
In the particular case of the Azores , the risk is all the greater given the volcanic nature of the seabed .
Let us keep that in mind , in Portugal , on 20 February of next year .     .
In other words , we must develop competitiveness , but without damaging cohesion ; rather , we must make cohesion stronger .     , .
That activity , which leaves unemployment and poverty in its wake – as evidenced by company relocations in Portugal – does not create genuine wealth in the country concerned .
It offers us a fairly extensive presentation of the criteria to be met and of the progress already
