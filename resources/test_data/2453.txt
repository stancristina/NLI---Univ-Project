I , for my part , was present , as I was sent as an observer by my group and I can confirm that the operation went very smoothly in Lomé , in most of the 617 polling stations , and I was able to visit a large number of these stations , including some in the Bé district .
In contrast , it was when the counting of results was centralised that a certain number of mistakes and problems appeared , the most important , of course , being the resignation of the electoral commission and the transfer of the counting of results to the Minister for the Interior .
As we have not seen him during the past few months , I think it is important to point out that he is not here today either .
Madam President , here again we are witnessing a nasty trick .
I would like to thank the colleagues from the PPE and from the Liberal Group for having supported this resolution .
Mr President , I would like to comment on the previous vote .
This is particularly important in order to reintroduce criteria and public service aims in air transport , based on greater participation of users with new control and intervention rights .
In both cases , use is made of so-called open networks whose authentication , integrity and confidentiality must be assured .
Madam President , I should just like to point out that my name is not on yesterday 's attendance register , although I took part in all the votes .
Its efforts should be concentrated on tightening things up and giving priority to the only two real common policies : the CAP and the CFP , by giving them the resources and instruments they need to operate efficiently .
The Council 's proposal adopts the principle of an intergovernmental procedure , which implies that Member States themselves are competent , by means of their respective legal systems , with regard to the interpretation of the joint action and the settlement of any disputes concerning its implementation .
We shall vote in favour of it , but without a doubt , the action taken by Member States is still very ineffective due to the sheer scale of economic activities linked with crime .
Neither Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure nor Article 138b of the Treaty applies here , and all the Members present will bear me out .
This obviously affects both European citizens and carriers when they use Community airports .
Nevertheless , 14 amendments were adopted , aimed at strengthening collective action , extending the sources of information and introducing a degree of transparency by providing for the publication of groundings in cases where there is an immediate safety hazard .
After long weeks of informal negotiations which were , unfortunately , unsuccessful - Mr Medina reminded us earlier that this dossier has been pending since 1993 - we are now faced by a most uncomfortable alternative .
I think that we should vote for the joint text that is before us , emphasising that it is absolutely essential that the letter and the spirit should be fully respected .
Is the Commission taking the necessary steps to establish an economic information policy for the European Union , employing all the legal means at its disposal ?
That is curious , to say the least , and I should like some further information on this point .
However , we can only be concerned when it becomes clear that certain ill-intentioned people are seeking to use the most advanced technologies in such a way as to make our societies less and not more free .
Indeed , is it wise , in the name of practicality , to try to negotiate waivers to the extraterritorial implications of unilateral laws , particularly when the principle itself has not been questioned before the appropriate international bodies ?
Consequently , this country naturally occupies a position of undisputed dominance on the economic , cultural and political fronts .
So there is a great deal that could be said on this subject .
There is talk of partnership .
I find this argument unacceptable and invalid , as many associations are selflessly engaged in fighting this scourge .
The joint proposal can therefore be seen as acceptable to the extent that it guarantees the presence of superior quality fuel from the year 2005 , or even from the year 2000 .
All of this will bring a concrete change to the everyday lives of the Union 's citizens .
In fact , although we did not vote for this report , this was solely because we were opposed to the compensation clause as it had been formulated .
We must avoid creating industrial costs which are disproportionate to the benefits in terms of improvements to the environment .
The official thesis is that carbon dioxide emissions are warming the planet .
We now know that standards must be imposed , but also that this is not enough .
Admittedly , this initially brings additional costs , sometimes considerable , as wasting and polluting is cheaper in the short term .
For example , there must be around 75 billion coins to be minted in the European Union and some 10 billion notes to be printed .
But it is the same as with every coin , which has its other side .
This is tantamount to saying 'in principle you are equal , but in practice you are not , and we do not want to change Article 147' and herein lies the root of the problem .
The Amsterdam Treaty could have been taken to its logical conclusion by reinforcing the control over the implementing rules so that the legislative procedure could be fully respected .
The hostility of the Council to any re-examination of the problem is becoming annoying , but what is worrying and
