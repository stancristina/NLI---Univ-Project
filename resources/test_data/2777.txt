This is not a European Union issue .
Mr President , as you know , as part of the energy sanctions imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , it was decided , on the basis of a proposal discussed in the Council , to provide for exceptional measures for municipalities run by democratic forces .
We deeply regret the need to maintain energy sanctions against Yugoslavia , but they form part of a set of measures identified to exert pressure on the regime there , and in particular they represent a form of pressure on the way Mr Milosevic is running the country .
I totally accept the honourable Member ' s premise that every people needs to be the master of its own destiny , that is exactly what we are seeking .
For this precise purpose , and in all cases where a citizen of a Member State is threatened with the death penalty in a third country , there is now a coordination mechanism allowing combined approaches to be made to the governments of third countries by the European Union missions in those countries .
As you know , this is a procedural matter and involves deadlines set unilaterally by the European Parliament .
A systematic approach for consular cooperation and for coordinated consular action has only been developed in the last few years .
You will recall that as an institution , the Council is not empowered to make any amendments to the Treaty , which is quite natural , as questions of this kind can normally only be raised at an Intergovernmental Conference .
To sum up , your questions raise some sensitive problems which , as we know , have been discussed in this House in recent years in the context of increasing its powers , and Parliament has been using its budgetary authority as a legitimate source of pressure .
Although this item is still on the table , as all these issues are kept on the agenda until the end of the conference , it does seem to us at this stage that there is unlikely to be any significant progress on this .
Mr President , Mrs Hedkvist Petersen' s question is a very important one , but we do not have any information to the effect that the Commission is considering reducing state aids in this field .
Mrs Hedkvist Petersen , I am of course especially conscious of the point you have made about the Union ' s smaller Member States .
What we have to recognise is that when we are considering a broader Community , no situation affecting democratic rights in one country can be a matter of indifference to the other countries and their citizens .
The attitude adopted by some Member States towards the Austrian Government related to their negative perception of the new Austrian Government , which does not affect the Community framework .
As you know , there are parties which are opposed to the European Union , but that does not mean that they should be seen as undemocratic .
Mr President , it is possible to keep track of the Council ' s work by means of the monthly reports prepared by the General Secretariat of the Council and which are published on the Council ' s web site , covering legislative and non-legislative acts approved since January 1999 and including the results of votes , explanations of vote and statements for the minutes when the Council is acting in its legislative capacity .
It is also possible to obtain information on the legislative transparency of the Council by e-mail .
During the Finnish presidency , substantial progress was made in the field of access to documents by means of modern information technology , and in particular the Internet .
This proposal was presented to the Commission , in the College of Commissioners , on 26 January , and , as I have said , it attempts to fulfil the objectives of increasing transparency , and in particular proposes significant amendments to the 1999 Code of Conduct .
Discussion of legislative proposals within the government is not in the public domain , but the result of these legislative proposals is in the public domain , whether they come before parliament or not .
Firstly , if that was how Parliament saw things , we could even give not twenty , but thirty answers to honourable Members ' questions .
Mr President , I will not discuss the content of this agreement since many speakers , including the rapporteur , have already covered it .
What we do know is that our concern must make us more rigorous in our relations with Mexico .
That is how rigorous we believe we need to be but it will not detract from our support for approval of this agreement .
First there is the pragmatic deficit .
And finally there is the investment deficit .
However , this is a very sensitive issue , and I want to raise it with the Bureau , so that the matter can be clarified , because if that is what we are supposed to have voted for , I think an extremely grave political precedent has been created .
Ferrer report ( A5-0066/2000 )
It is essential that the Commission and the Member States commit themselves decisively to all the support actions , including financial aid for materials and equipment , technical assistance for mine-clearance in the areas of the country where this problem still applies , support for holding an International Conference to mobilise as much emergency aid as possible and obtain the economic resources necessary for the recovery of Mozambique ' s economy , which has been so cruelly affected by the floods .
We regard the resolution we will be voting on today as the continuation of an emergency debate
