current " salmon war ' between the United States and Canada .
The Galician people whom I represent here still cannot understand why Canada behaved so aggressively in the fishing conflict which it started , in violation of international law .
The agreement on the application of part 11 of the convention encountered fewer difficulties .
Unfortunately we cannot avoid this .
We have always sat next to each other , because of our surnames , and I feel very sorry to be losing the advice and help which he has given me on so many occasions .
Another of the important consequences , to which Mr Rothley and Mr Florio have referred , is the principle of a legal hierarchy .
This point brings us , Mr President , to the tricky and dangerous question of the principle of subsidiarity , which has also been alluded to during this debate .
Mr President , I am not going to spend much time on the problems which this Republic and the Greek people have both suffered - you know these much better than I do .
In fact , the principle threat to the country 's stability lies in the treatment of the problem of the Albanian minority .
Therefore , the Committee on External Economic Relations thinks that in this region troubled by continuous political , economic and even military problems , which have gone so far as to affect the development of the European Union , it is politically important that we should support this cooperation agreement .
In this respect , it is essential that ACP policy should retain those provisions which guarantee the ACP countries a presence in exports to European countries , by means of preference systems .
I attended the sitting that day , as I always do .
I hope that Parliament 's Presidency will help me resist this smear campaign .
There is no mutual back-scratching here .
We are sure , Mr President , that you will do your utmost to protect the honour of this House and its Members , especially those who - like the people in question - are highly responsible in their work .
We are all equal in questions of justice .
Well , Mr President , in the case of this request from the Portuguese legal authorities , Parliament cannot make a decision about whether immunity should be lifted , because the procedural criteria have not been met .
The second procedure , No 6119/94 , is very different .
I am reminded of the beautiful words spoken by Arg√ºelles in the Preamble to the Spanish Constitution of 1812 when he said that light comes from the starry sky of ideas .
Nobody can prove that they are not corrupt .
I appreciate that there can be political arguments in support of the opposite course of action , and the Committee on the Rules of Procedure , the Verification of Credentials and Immunities voted accordingly .
The Commission has paid particular attention to this specific sector , and Mr Hoppenstedt 's report , the main arguments of which we support , has been written on this basis .
Nobody in the European Parliamentary Committee on Research , Technological Development and Energy is happy with the result , but I must make it clear that we have all done what had to be done .
Nevertheless , we have opened up several lines : we have an extra ECU 115 million .
You should tell that to all the commissioners , and maybe they will provide more funds for biomedical programmes .
At first reading , the European Parliament tabled a series of amendments .
The Directive is not restricted to the legal protection of a specific type of design , but covers them all .
If a watch breaks , we normally throw it away and buy a new one - unless it is an antique , when industrial considerations virtually cease to be relevant .
My viewpoint as rapporteur for the first reading was that protection should extend to components , but this was thrown out by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights , whereupon I gave in gracefully and accepted their opinion .
This stability can only be achieved by finding a solution - either good or bad .
As for Parliament , I believe we have fulfilled our obligations by presenting this set of reasonable amendments , designed with compromise in mind .
The difficulty in arriving at a satisfactory legal definition of design has been due to problems related to resolving this conflict .
I would have been in favour of an even greater reduction in the time-scale for protection , but I nevertheless think that Parliament 's solutions are compromises which deserve to be supported .
It is just a small detail .
Parliament also needs closer collaboration with the Commission .
Do they have the resources to achieve these aims ?
It is not easy to achieve all these things together , but they certainly cannot be imposed by decree .
But they cannot make these changes , which almost amount to a revolution , on their own .
The current situation would benefit from a bold approach .
We must share our experiences in how to convert passive policies into active policies , and unemployment benefits into support for new jobs .
I think it is high time this was resolved once and for all , throughout the whole system .
I think that is very clear .
I would not like to see Parliament sacrifice part of the non-compulsory expenditure which it has at its disposal just for the sake of a news story on television the day after the extraordinary summit in Luxembourg .
In fact , this child does not have much of a chance of completely fulfilling its destiny .
I think there is a need to move further towards both a European approach to statistics , and improved accuracy
