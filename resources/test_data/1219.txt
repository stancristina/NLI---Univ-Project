Mr President , Madam President-in-Office of the Council , in addition to those issues already mentioned here , we are expecting - and someone has already referred to this - the Helsinki Summit to promote protection of the environment and to at last place environmental protection at the heart of Union action .
We must now take a definite step forward on this issue , as we know how difficult it has been to put a stop to negative developments with regard to the environment , and we are expecting determination and concrete results from you in the areas of business , industry and agriculture .
I have followed Mrs Halonen' s battle with the City of London bankers , and I believe that there will be no end to this struggle until we can decide the issue of taxation by means of a qualified majority .
The subject that will surely live on after the Helsinki Summit is , however , concrete decisions on a common security arrangement .
The European Union is , after all , a civil organisation , and if it now develops a military crisis management capacity , we can also trust it to consider the wisdom that says it is always better to prevent crises rather than try to calm things down through the use of force .
Our group was most satisfied when it heard recently that High Representative Xavier Solana had started to look into a parliamentary initiative for the establishment of civil crisis management troops .
Madam President-in-Office of the Council , you mentioned a Millennium Declaration : it seems the Council has also been bitten by the millennium bug.
So perhaps you could give us a tiny hint about what kind of tracks we will be leaving at the millennium celebrations .
I will surprise the Finnish representatives of the country to hold the presidency by saying that the Finnish Presidency can already now be termed , in the positive sense , historic .
At Tampere , we decided to draft a Charter of Fundamental Rights , in which the European Parliament will also be fully involved .
This step towards a common foreign and defence policy , in close cooperation with NATO , is an important part of civil , economic and political crisis management .
The Intergovernmental Conference , at which next year will be decided the institutional changes that are required within the Community as a condition for enlargement , will have its roots in , and receive its agenda from , Helsinki .
But is our own house in order at present , and what must the people of those countries trying to join the Community think about this patent protectionism , which undermines the basic work of the Community in the economic sector ?
How can we be contemplating enlargement if we are still fighting in the current EU area in a manner that goes against the rules of the Single Market ?
I only wish to say that the future aims in Helsinki are good ones , but our own European house must also be put in order in accordance with the rules of the Union .
The development that began with the turning point in autumn 1989 has reached a stage of controlled progress , thanks to the determined policies of the European Union .
We have laid down clear guidelines for Europe ' s development , but there is work still to be done .
These areas form an important whole on the agenda of the Helsinki European Council and , as has been said here , this whole is so dynamic that if everything succeeds , the Helsinki meeting will be an historic event .
The President-in-Office of the Council ' s excellent speech fully covered the questions and challenges of a common security and defence policy for the Union .
A respect for fundamental rights and aspirations towards social equality are the best defence policy for ensuring social stability .
Finally , I would like to express my sincere congratulations to the country to hold the presidency for having succeeded , with no amendments to regulations , this has not yet been possible , in clearly increasing transparency in the decision-making process in the European Union and especially , in the European Council .
Hopefully , future countries to hold the presidency will carry on the good work .
Mr President , the annual report in question is a welcome and important beginning , and its value is underlined by the fact that independent NGOs were equal partners at the human rights forum which has just ended and which was organised on the initiative of the country holding the presidency .
Since the end of the Cold War they have manifested themselves more dramatically than before in the balance between classic basic freedoms , on the one hand , and collective rights , such as economic , social and cultural rights , on the other .
As the President-in-Office of the Council said , reports on violations of human rights are an everyday occurrence .
As we develop the Union ' s own position on human rights we must , as the Foreign Minister , Mrs Halonen , said , be consistent .
But we must also maintain a balance .
The European Union cannot complacently and regardless of others develop its own human rights culture in such a way as to upset the balance .
The Union should now be focusing on the effective implementation of agreements .
Monitoring must lead to a comprehensive assessment of the situation with regard to human rights .
In recent years , the EU has witnessed within its borders police violence , which has often been targeted against persons from outside the EU , cell deaths and discrimination against sexual minorities .
The lack of protection for refugees is perhaps the biggest human rights problem within
