, an important tool , perhaps the most important tool to the working of the stock markets .
I think that this will give us a chance to prove the speed and efficiency of our legislative procedure which , unfortunately , has been thrown into doubt recently by certain reports , such as the Lamfalussy report .
We believe that progress on these fronts will strengthen the productive potential of the European economy , to the benefit of one and all .
We also believe that the market cannot use its autonomous and automatic procedures to create the changes needed for the purpose .
It is exactly this sort of reforming intervention which I have the honour of recommending in this report on upgrading the directive in question .
The fact that , under the original directive , the investment company no longer needed to file 15 applications and obtain 15 licences , but only needed one licence in order to establish anywhere in Europe was , without doubt , a step forward , but it lost much of its impetus because each company had to deal with 15 different legislative regimes on the ground .
In the United States , which can teach us a great deal about these matters , one central clearing house acts for the whole country .
By strengthening competition as part of the procedure of stock exchange mergers being promoted by the euro , there is hope that , in the end , the companies with the lowest costs will prevail , rather than the companies with the strongest monopolistic links .
Many of the rules on the integrity of the markets , such as rules to combat insider trading , need to be extended to the internal transactions of these companies , while other rules , which at one time only related to companies , such as rules governing customer relations , should also apply to stock exchanges .
Of course , we do delude ourselves that a regulation will do away with speculation at a single blow .
On the quantitative side , we used the classic method of auditing the implementation of the budget and found things to our satisfaction and liking .
The inventory of Parliament ' s property has been started , albeit somewhat late , and is making headway .
But what do we give out , what image does Parliament project to the outside world as it operates this huge , serious institution ?
It would be a good idea if we knew what these citizens , for whom a large sum of money is earmarked so that they can visit and get to know Parliament , feel about the European Parliament , and use them to show us a better way forward .
This would turn discharge from a one-off issue into a continuous , constructive procedure .
Mr President , with just one minute , I must be absolutely specific .
I shall use my one minute to congratulate Mrs van der Laan on her report and mention CEDEFOP , which is headquartered in Thessaloniki .
As a result , diseases are easily transmitted and it is difficult , if not impossible , to stop diseases moving from one country to another .
It merely proves that we need to reinstate border controls at internal frontiers in order to prevent the emergence and spread of epizootic diseases and to compensate livestock farmers for their losses .
I must say that I agree with the way in which you have set things out , but there is one problem .
I would like it to be made clear from your side - I think you expressed it well , but you could perhaps stress a little more - that no such way out will be given to extremists inside this country or , as you well know , outside it , to political forces in Kosovo .
This sort of policy can only be implemented through a specific programme of actions , target evaluations , statistics and specific , self-imposed deadlines .
This new concept should also inform corresponding policies in the Member States .
So the message is that we are moving from an awareness to practicalities and that the aim is to ensure that these people play a full part in economic and social life .
I note that , like many of her fellow members , she has identified two basic aspects to the problem .
And the Commission communication , like Mrs Hermange ' s report , emphasizes the need for a horizontal approach to the issue of disability , i .e . the need to approach all policies and to take account of this aspect in all types of decision , which is why the communication also specifically refers to the need for access to buildings , the architectural dimension , employment , transport , research , technology , education and health .
The second interesting example is the e-EUROPE initiative , which incorporates five different specific lines of approach defining the needs of people with disabilities as regards access to all the new technologies and IT systems .
Thanks to the catalytic role of the European Parliament , we recently managed to adopt the directive banning discrimination against people with disabilities in the workplace in record time .
Last year , at Parliament ' s suggestion , the Commission agreed that our objective should be to include persons with disabilities in training and the employment strategy , an objective which was not , however , accepted by the Council of Ministers .
We shall come back to this again this year , in a bid to set specific quantitative targets at European and national level for the participation of people with disabilities in the employment strategy programme , be it in the form of training , lifelong learning , access to new technologies or subsidised jobs
