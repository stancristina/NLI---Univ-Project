I think that as part of this effort by the Commission - and by ourselves - particular care should be taken , as we prepare for enlargement , to ensure that during the pre-accession period a serious effort will be made to reduce the problems of racism , xenophobia and other such phenomena in the countries that are applicants for accession , so that we will not later be importing into the Union problems with which we are already familiar , either from refugees coming from those countries or in our own countries .
The Union is necessarily becoming an increasingly political and social entity .
Mr President , on the eve of the 21st century , a new German Presidency is trying to address the problems inherited from the past , the concerns felt today and the challenges of the future .
Political union must really become our lodestar , but perhaps what we need is a federal political euro if we are ever to get there .
How does the German Presidency 's programme propose to deal with these problems ?
We are not motivated by prejudice , Mr President-in-Office , but we do feel the need to point out that major problems call for major policies and for the wherewithal to put them into effect .
Would that we were proved wrong .
Is that the great problem about whose solution the German and other governments are agonising ?
They could be calculated in macro-economic terms so that we could all see the complete picture , and then we would be able in good faith to examine the problem of distributing the burden fairly .
How is it possible on the one hand to declare a lively interest in making very rapid progress towards enlargement and on the other hand to restrict the resources that would facilitate it ?
We heard nothing about that in Mr Fischer 's speech .
The Europe of the future , of integration , as you very rightly said , must be open and must offer prospects for all its citizens and for all Europe 's states and nations .
And , ladies and gentlemen , I wonder why we pass resolutions about China and accuse it of a lack of democracy and transparency , when the Council of Ministers of the European Union is doing exactly the same thing .
They must not even say anything to the European Parliament , because it is not in our interests to hear what goes on in the Commission .
Mr President , my group of course supports the report by Mr Monfils , so it also supports the intention to reject the common position on the European Capital of Culture .
That needs no explanation , it is self-evident , and I think everyone who has spoken so far has said as much in one way or another .
With today 's proposal the European Parliament 's aim is to compel the Council to convene the Conciliation Committee and re-establish interinstitutional balance .
That is a period of time as long as the arrogance that led to it is great !
Mr President , I too wish to stress that those four reports can have a positive effect .
I will declare my support by referring to two points .
Secondly , I wish to stress that today , in this phase we are passing through towards enlargement , we in the European Union must insist , by clarifying and refining the Copenhagen criteria , that human rights should be included in this process .
That is why we must achieve agreement about commonly accepted rules and the way they should be implemented , and why a code of basic social obligations should be drawn up .
Finally , I should like to say that with its continually increasing profile , authority and political power , the European Union can intervene effectively to establish labour norms which will respect human rights all over the world .
Six years after the White Paper by Mr Delors , the trans-European networks , which were put forward as a way of increasing employment to compensate for the complete disruption of labour relations and the promotion of flexible forms of employment , are still making very little progress due to lack of the resources to finance them .
That policy is to the disadvantage of our peoples and their interests , it promotes an accumulation of private profits to the cost of the public service , and it constitutes a complete abandonment of any prospect that trans-European networks could contribute to the development of employment .
On the other hand , the same measures aim to do away with the inalienable right of farmers and their children to cultivate their land and develop their output , by means of unacceptable and arbitrary quotas , large and savage compensatory fines , so that there too monopoly capital will be able to spread , get its hands on agricultural holdings and throw farmers out of work or , if it allows them to remain and work in the countryside , then to do so as a new type of share-cropper .
And do not think that such a thing will never happen , that we will not have a repetition of the peasants ' revolt .
Mr President , today we are in the home stretch for the completion of approval for the part of Agenda 2000 which relates to the common agricultural policy - I would say its most important part , given the importance of the agricultural sector at many levels and its multi-functional character , let alone the extent to which the agricultural guideline plays a part in the Community 's budget .
The addition of new actions to the EAGGF 's field of intervention in the Guarantee Section , especially the measures concerning the development of the countryside and pre-accession aid to
