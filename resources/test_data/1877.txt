rules naturally apply to the Czech Republic as apply to other candidate States and , in the long run , to Member States .
I hope that the Czechs are able to give positive answers to all the questions and that a favourable solution can in that way be found to this problem .
When it comes to taking action , however , the situation is often the reverse .
Allow me to begin by commenting on the new thinking required .
Now , it is a matter of educating people for life .
We need to allocate much greater resources to education than we have done up until now , both to the workplace and to the public education system , as well as to other areas .
There must be money to pay for the costs of education and also to replace income in the form of wages , especially in the case of those who need to study full-time .
Consideration might be given to earmarking a certain proportion of companies ' production costs for this purpose , a specific percentage of the State budget , a particular portion of normal working hours or , if appropriate , a certain number of the individual ' s working hours .
Many speakers here in the Chamber have agreed about the need to set financial priorities .
Within the EU , extensive registers of personal data are now being compiled in which very sensitive personal information is stored .
To that extent , we are in favour of the basic ideas in this report but we wish , however , to point out that it is important to construct this supervisory authority on the basis of the skills possessed by the Member States in this area .
Moreover , the Sirene organisation established under the Schengen agreement must be covered by a new supervisory authority .
That experience is unfortunately very disheartening .
In spite of the difficult working conditions , the JSA reveals serious deficiencies in SIS , for example incorrect information on file , instances of Member States ' illegally copying information and inadequate procedures for gaining access to registers .
One requirement is that registers of criminals be distinguished from registers of refugees and registers kept to protect state security .
At present , the scope of the register goes far beyond what is necessary .
After listening to Mr Hughes , to the British Labour Government and also to others in Britain , I am extremely confident that they are deeply committed to finding answers to these questions .
After listening to Mr Menrad , I am very confident that the German Christian Democratic Party is thoroughly engaged with these issues in Germany .
What is it , then , which leads us to believe that it is at the level of the European Parliament , representing countries with more than 15 national parliaments , that the right forum for decision-making is to be found ?
Ladders used for access should be long enough for their uprights to protrude sufficiently beyond the access platform .
I can absolutely assure you that , at home in Mora in Dalarna , where I live , as well as in the Swedish Parliament and also in all other national parliaments , these matters are being carefully looked into .
Allow them to determine how to frame the rules so as to fulfil the requirements of the directive in the best way .
It is in danger of destroying biological diversity and may also entail damage which jeopardises the long-term productive capacity of natural systems .
It is also important , of course , in the developing countries , especially in connection with the development cooperation initiated by the European Union .
At the last reading , there were significant differences between our own points of view and the proposal adopted by the Council .
Allow me to mention three important examples of these .
Parliament ' s approach to this question was to opt for the least possible involvement , that is to say to make the Commission chiefly responsible for the implementation itself and to evaluate it subsequently .
With the conciliation we have achieved , we have taken a welcome step in that direction .
Thirdly , we demanded at the second reading that the regulation should not be limited in time , that is to say that this type of activity should be planned on a very long-term basis .
I therefore recommend that Parliament approve the result of the conciliation .
Today , we do have reason for thanking Diana Wallis for displaying what has most emphatically been the patience of a saint and the stamina of an athlete in drawing up this report .
One great merit of this piece of work is the importance which the rapporteur and Parliament attach to consumer-friendly dispute-resolution mechanisms and the pressure they have brought to bear in order to obtain these .
It is a question with which we shall be confronted many times in connection , for example , with tax issues and cyber crime .
This also emerged yesterday from our seminar on cyber crime .
I should like finally to strike a biblical note .
We have abstained from voting on Mr Skinner ' s report concerning minimum safety and health requirements for workers ' use of work equipment at work .
On these issues , the European Union gives Europe ' s democracies a chance to show the world that cooperation leads to peace and increased prosperity .
All other questions ought to be dealt with at local , regional or national levels .
This is not one such area .
Directives ought essentially to be aimed at establishing goals , not at regulating the details and describing the path to the goal .
Requiring at European level that employers should take necessary measures to guarantee workers ' safety is only reasonable .
