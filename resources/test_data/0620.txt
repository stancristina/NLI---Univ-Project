.
I have nothing against the two sides of industry agreeing on longer working hours with a reference period of anything up to a year and an average of a maximum of 48 hours a week , but I do object to employers having the option of taking on workers on an individual basis , thereby gaining the chance to apply various exceptions .
I hope that , on Wednesday , the European Parliament will say that , in future , Europe should 'work smarter and not harder ' in order to meet the challenges of the future .
Twenty-two months ago there were not many people who believed that the EU would commit to 20 % of its energy consumption in 2020 coming from renewable energy sources .
With this , we can finally see the end of several hundred years of dependence on oil and gas , a dependence that has damaged our climate and caused war , unrest and inequality throughout the world .
The road to this point has also been bumpy and full of obstacles , but as we stand here today it is in recognition of the fact that we can no longer allow matters simply to take their course .
We need to act , and with this directive on renewable energy we are taking the first step towards a cleaner and better world .
The agreement we have reached with the Council is a good result from the point of view of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , because we have retained the principal binding targets , so irrespective of how many evasive strategies some of the countries have come up with , 20 % of the EU 's energy consumption in 2020 will come from green energy .
We are also pleased that second generation biofuels have a double rating in the accounts , so that there is an incentive to develop new energy technologies .
Proud that the European Parliament has shown that it is capable of taking action , and pleased that the Socialist Group has had a decisive influence , so that tomorrow we can give our support to this legislation .
Mr President , the many months we have just spent negotiating the climate package have been dramatic and exciting , and I would like to thank Mrs Hassi and the shadow rapporteurs for their constructive and open cooperation .
Right from the outset we pushed for an ambitious climate package in order to be credible in Copenhagen .
They have obtained the flexibility to do this , but they do not , of course , have to use it .
The flexibility mechanisms are intended to be seen as emergency measures and not as a means to achieve targets .
We would also have liked more stringent penalties for Member States in order to ensure that we do not get to 2019 with some countries still being a long way from achieving their targets .
They must create the necessary framework for low CO2 growth by means of more efficient energy use and more sustainable forms of energy .
The necessary work has now been distributed , the means for achieving the targets are in place and now the Member States must deliver .
Remember : the climate package is the starting point for the negotiations that will take place in Copenhagen , where we absolutely have to reach an international agreement .
Mr President , it is a shame that the climate plan has been watered down so much after the Council meeting last week .
It will provide the opportunity to indicate good intentions at a symbolic level , but on a practical level very little will happen .
CO2 is a pollutant whether it is in the air or under the ground .
We cannot base our efforts to protect the climate on hiding pollution away for future generations .
The proposal on the table is even based on a non-existent technology .
Bridging technology in this context means that money will be invested in something that has no future , money that could instead be used to develop the renewable energy sector .
Madam President , I would like to begin by thanking the two rapporteurs , Mrs Haug and Mr Lewandowski , for their extremely competent and professional work on the budget .
The budget is , of course , highly inflexible .
We should not be ungrateful to the Commission for this .
What we are pleased about is that it was possible to find a solution that did not involve large cuts in other programmes , but that we found the funds in the Flexibility Instrument and the Emergency Aid Reserve .
We have an historic task over the next few years , and that is to ensure that the necessary development takes place in the new Member States .
I think that this is certainly the most important aspect of the EU budget .
Of course , along the way , we have complained about the lack of initiatives in the budget relating to energy , and then , at the eleventh hour , a memorandum arrived in the wake of the financial crisis , stating that the EU budget , too , was to be used in an attempt to initiate growth .
However , I look forward to constructive cooperation on these matters and I would like to thank the Commission for the initiative .
Madam President , when the proposal from the Commission was published it prompted a headline in a major Danish newspaper .
In Denmark , we are very proud of the fact that we have a huge amount of clean groundwater that we can drink completely untreated .
If the Commission 's proposal were to have been implemented as it was originally presented , it would have meant that in Denmark we would have roughly doubled the number of pesticides on the market .
