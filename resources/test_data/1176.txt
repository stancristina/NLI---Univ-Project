With regard to the minimum level of training for seamen , our proposal involves a simple comparison with the existing provision in the Regulation establishing the Agency , with a more important role for the Community , in accordance with Directive 2001/25/EC .
By way of conclusion , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I note that the positions of the Council and Parliament in this regard are very close and I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Mastorakis for the work he has done .
It should also have a sufficient fleet of rapid intervention ships and specialised rescue ships , also with the capacity for pumping and transfer of fuel from any ship which finds itself in difficulties .
The rapporteur’s amendments specify that the main responsibility in the field of pollution lies with the coastal States , which must have their own resources – which some of us find logical – and that the actions of the Agency will only come into play following a request from the Member State , in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity .
I would like to say to the honourable Members , firstly , that in the field of security , in the anti-terrorist sense as well , somebody has to carry out the tasks of control , supervision and support , which are often closely related to security in the other sense , and we therefore believe it would be better for the Agency to deal with the two aspects .
We will have to seek the most appropriate formula and , undoubtedly , this Parliament , although only by means of budgets , will have plenty to say about which formula is ultimately decided on .
As soon as possible , ladies and gentlemen .
I would like to point out to the honourable Members – and thereby reply to Mrs Miguélez Ramos – that it is obvious that the north-western coast of the Iberian Peninsula is one of the points of greatest risk in terms of ship pollution .
We are aware that we will very probably in the future have to deal with issues such as flags of convenience and certain aspects of maritime law – and I am referring to what Mr Casaca said .
I would insist that it must also be possible to transport them by road .
I trust that the Council will carefully study the results of this first reading in Parliament and that it can agree a Common Position quickly and , if possible , a Common Position which supports the proposal which is going to be issued by this Parliament .     .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank Mr Stockmann for the work he has done and I believe that Parliament’s support for this initiative in general – though with some modifications – demonstrates its importance .
This is all part of a whole .
What we are proposing are common standards which can facilitate – if the market considers it appropriate – operation within the intermodal network with these new bodies , which , as I said before , would prevent interruptions and would allow the quick transfer from river to sea , to rail or to road .
We are convinced that it urgently needs to be applied , but unfortunately , the Member States are not taking the step forward .
Since 1978 , the Fund has been used in more than one hundred cases , and in the majority the limit set was sufficient .
In fact it would have been enough to issue the assent , but I felt it was essential to stress the request in Recital C of the Decision , that it is important for the Member States to sign or ratify the Protocol .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , all that remains – as my time is running out – is for me to thank the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for the support they have given me , this committee and Parliament’s services for their invaluable help , and the Commission for the political support that it has consistently given .
We therefore continue to call for a European Fund in addition to all the existing international funds , particularly considering the huge amount of oil traffic on our seas and the existence of areas such as the ‘ , or the ‘Coast of Death ’ in Galicia , which is one of the places where there have been the most maritime accidents in the past , along with other black spots such as the Calais straits , etc .
For example , in the case of the , we are talking about EUR 5 000 million , which is only one fifth of the amount needed to cover the damage , which is why Mr Ortuondo stressed the need for an additional European fund .
This is not an agreement signed by the Member States in the interests of the Community , but an agreement signed by the European Union in the interests of the whole of the European Union : defending national sovereignty does not benefit the citizens of the European Union , which is what we are concerned with .
The first was mentioned by Mr Ortuondo Larrea : more than a year after the disaster we are far from succeeding in assessing the full extent of the consequences , not only because the vessel , carrying at least 15 000 tonnes , is still 3 000 metres deep in the Atlantic , but also because the oil is still reaching our coastlines .
I entirely agree with Mr Medina that it should be the Commission that is responsible to the International Maritime Organisation , at least for matters in which
