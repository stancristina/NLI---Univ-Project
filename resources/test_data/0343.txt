Treaties actually asks the Fourteen to take action in respect of a country whose human rights record is called into question .
He seems to imply that this is a matter for the Presidency-in-Office and not for fourteen sets of bilateral relations .
Mr President , the rapporteur has already explained the SAB is asking to approve two separate sums of money .
I hope that these sums have been arrived at after taking good account of the principles of budgetary prudence and value for money .
The political decision to approve the building for Mr Solana and the 45 military personnel had already been taken by the fifteen Member States at Helsinki .
I would like to raise three issues about this .
Firstly , it is not clear why the military personnel in the building should be counted as administrative expenditure .
They would more appropriately come under the heading of operational expenditure .
Secondly , I understand there is a gentlemen 's agreement according to which the European Parliament and the Council agreed not to interfere with each other 's budget .
I believe this has been pushed to its limit .
The Council 's interpretation of the gentlemen 's agreement is certainly imaginative .
The agreement applies to buildings and Council staff but not necessarily to seconded military personnel , whose salary comes from their own Member State .
However their overheads would be paid for by the EU in the future with no real monitoring or accountability role by any institution .
Thirdly , I am not satisfied with the use of the SAB as an instrument for this because these extra needs were foreseen prior to the conclusion of the budgetary process last year and should have been incorporated in this year 's budget .
In accordance with the spirit of the gentlemen 's agreement , I will not comment on the need for 45 military personnel in the building .
That will surely be as safe as Fort Knox .
The point I wish to raise here is that Council must apply the same sort of budgetary rigour to its administrative expenditure as it expects of other institutions .
And I would like some reassurance in the future that this expenditure will be spent in the most efficient and economic way possible .
On Parliament 's request for the extra 15 million for the additional advance payment for the new building in Brussels , although it can be identified as a prudent step which will allow considerable savings in the future , I am concerned about the messages that this may convey .
I believe it is crucial for Parliament to introduce activity-based budgeting as a matter of utmost urgency .
Mr President , in his report Mr Mombaur has certainly given a comprehensive coverage of the implications of the liberalization of these markets .
Energy , of course , is not just any good or service .
It is very basic and very essential and has to be treated differently from normal goods .
The two directives were very carefully calculated to ensure that there would not be huge and sudden job losses - approximately 250,000 jobs have been lost in this sector , with more to come - and secondly to allow those Member States which had invested heavily in , for example , nuclear energy to do some strategic planning and not leave them with too much in the way of stranded costs .
For that reason they were not full speed ahead directives .
Nevertheless they should have been implemented on time by every Member State and they were not .
Those which delayed were wrong , especially those which at the same time took advantage of the opening of markets elsewhere and we have evidence that this also applies to countries outside the European Union .
I have said that the job losses were very considerable .
There has also been a great deal of upheaval and restructuring and some evidence of the formation of new monopolies , something which must be combated .
There has been a diminution in the amount of research and development and that is a shame .
There is a lack of harmonization to date and Mr Mombaur is quite right to call for harmonization .
I am fairly sceptical about allowing the regulators to do that through the Florence work .
The question of public service obligations is mentioned several times in the report .
The Socialist Group has put forward an amendment asking for a framework directive ensuring that in sectors like energy services of general interest are protected .
I hope that will be supported .
Although there are difficulties with the two directives and liberalization , it is part of creating Europe and lower prices do benefit people .
However there are environmental implications which we have not taken very seriously .
The Lisbon Council asked the Commission to look at the possible need for an acceleration .
I do not agree , however , with preaching to Member States and telling them what they should be doing .
It is up to them to decide .
I am very anxious that renewable energy is supported in a liberalised market .
That is not easy to do and it is something the Parliament holds dear .
I am very concerned about the threat to combined heat and power in the gas directive .
That needs to be rectified very quickly .
Mr President , I would like to convey my congratulations to the rapporteur for this report .
It is a very balanced piece of work covering quite a wide range of views .
We should point to progress made so far in liberalising the electricity and the gas markets , in particular opening up electricity to more than 60 % of the market so far , while also remembering that we need to keep up the pressure for more progress .
