In our opinion , it would have been more appropriate to delay the decision on accession until the Commission has presented its next progress report .
It is for this reason that I particularly welcome the efforts undertaken by the new Romanian Government , which is resolutely pushing ahead with reforms in order to overcome the delays caused by its predecessor .
The fact that we are still 20 months away from the envisaged date of accession would have been further justification for such a delay .
In the interests of both parties , the two candidate countries should be given longer to implement the Copenhagen criteria .
It is for this reason that we particularly welcome the efforts undertaken by the new Romanian Government , which is resolutely pushing ahead with reforms in order to overcome the delays caused by its predecessor .
In our opinion , it would have been more appropriate to delay the decision on accession until the Commission has presented its next progress report .
The aim behind this report was to allow us to exert a certain amount of pressure on the Council and the Commission , and today we have learnt that this course of action has proved successful , at least at this stage of the game .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , today we voted by an overwhelming majority in favour of Bulgaria and Romania joining the EU.
The illiteracy rate is rising in some areas , and the situation of minorities , in particular the Roma , leaves much to be desired .
We must focus our energies on stabilising South East Europe and Croatia , which is a Central European country that has as little reason to be called part of the Balkans as does the beautiful Bohemian town of Kaden an der Eger , or as do Munich or Altenkirchen in Siegerland .
The aim of this cooperation is not only to provide support to the Palestinians and Israelis and to bring about peace , but also to gain better control over cover-up activities for terrorism in the broadest sense , which is in fact our second main priority .
I will now move on to my second example .
These are not alternatives to NATO , and indeed most EU Member States are also NATO Member States .
As Mr Schmit has just said , multilateralism can be effective only if it is founded upon a strong transatlantic partnership .
In addition to that , there is the help we give with nuclear non-proliferation , in the shape , for example , of the enormous amount of aid the EU has given for nuclear safety and non-proliferation since the beginning of the 1990s , not to mention our commitment to fighting terrorism , the spread of small arms and landmines , and drugs .
This makes it an essential instrument in implementing the European Security Strategy .
The three major ones are , without a doubt , terrorism , weapons of mass destruction , and conflicts among our neighbours with direct effects on the European Union as a result of floods of refugees having a direct impact on the public in it .
I also want to say how very grateful I am to him for his constant and frank cooperation , the result of which has been broad support from the relevant groups in this House .
I might add that I believe that we should be having this debate in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg .     .
The European Security Strategy states that ‘the first line of defence against new threats will often be abroad’ .
If the smaller Member States are to contribute in the same way as the larger ones to the common European defence policy and to the operation of the single European rapid reaction force , they must also be guaranteed the same right to be consulted .     Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , there are two of Parliament’s statements in this report that I would like to revisit , and they have to do with the foreign and security policy situation in the Far East .
It is of the utmost importance to the European Union that we should retain in Europe a strong industrial base , without which we will not be able to maintain our competitiveness in global markets .
I am well aware that our options are very limited indeed where job losses are concerned , and I share your sentiments in this regard , but the Commission must adhere strictly to the law as it stands .
Do you assume that , in a world without tariffs – which are barriers to trade – and the competition to which they give rise , social and environmental standards would invariably and inevitably fall ?
The Commission will follow up every single case , as it is obliged to do so .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to begin by thanking my fellow members of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , in particular the shadow rapporteurs , for their good and constructive cooperation .
Our joint amendments , on which we will be voting tomorrow , are aimed above all at improving the way in which the directive will be implemented , without jeopardising the achievement of the recycling targets , which are so important in terms of environmental policy .
Let me close by returning to the subject of regulation .
I am also very grateful to the automobile industry for helping to put this directive together , for communication with this industry – one of enormous importance for Europe – is vital if long-term competitiveness is to be guaranteed .
The pharmaceutical industry is developing products , constantly improving them , making them harder to detect , and
