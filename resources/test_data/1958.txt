are low .
The situation harms solidarity and must end .
Some , then , are for liberalisation while others are for maintaining the status quo .
However , we need common rules , which should also be monitored .
Only actual costs should apply for access to the network , and then competition is possible and the consumer benefits .
We clearly highlighted this in the end in the framework legislation for the telecommunications sector , and it will benefit consumers in Europe .
Mr President , Mrs de Palacio , pollution abatement is a noble but difficult struggle , a delicate balance between economic prosperity and human welfare .
Nevertheless , health and the economy are inseparable companions in the long run .
Noise should be reduced where that is needed most .
It has to be made clear that the directive cannot apply to small aircraft , because nothing would be gained by banning them , although I am sure the radicals would like to protect deer and wild boars too from the sound of aircraft .
Not all my colleagues , however , have taken such a responsible view of the matter .
We , for our own part , can set a good example of how to manage trade policy .
May President Bush learn a lesson from it .
The best way to bring down noise levels , however , is by an international agreement on a reduction in aircraft noise .
There is no reason for us yet , however , to prescribe limits for the noise made by crows .
The punishment of the woman in question was based on Islamic law .
I would now like to ask whether the Commission has considered any tools that might be used through our policy on development cooperation to lessen this ever-growing exploitation of religious tension .
Many of us have been pestered and obstructed to an unreasonable degree by those who have masqueraded as philanthropists and defenders of the sick .
That is simply criminal harassment .
All this harassment , with people being urged to express their opinions , has been absolutely pointless .
A simple thought has many times crossed my mind : the means is the message .
If the means to lobby us has been so unscrupulous , it is hard to be convinced of the sincerity of the issue that lies behind it .
For that reason , with this directive there should be an appropriate definition of food supplements , a scientific assessment of all ingredients should be carried out , requirements relating to consumer information and labelling should be specified , quality standards should be developed , and an adequate monitoring system should be guaranteed .
For that reason , Parliament wishes to extend , by way of its own compromise proposal , the eighteen-month deadline proposed in the Council 's common position to 30 months .
Mr President , the recommendations under discussion today put forward by my colleague , Mrs Paulsen , are a continuation of the important work she has been so very commendably involved in as Parliament 's rapporteur regarding updating the legislation on food safety .
I would like to say that I agree with the view expressed just now by Mr Pesälä regarding Amendment No 15 .
The traditional , common sense way in which catering waste is used for feeding has for the present unfortunately proved problematic as a result of inadequacies in the processing of feed .
For that reason Parliament now requires the Commission to promptly submit a legislative proposal banning the use of catering waste of animal origin as feed and obliging Member States to provide proof of its safe disposal .
That is why it is unfortunate that the most prominent element in publicising the work to improve food safety , the establishment of a new Food Safety Authority , has proved such a difficult task in the Council and that the agency is commencing its work in a temporary location .
I am mainly alluding to the situation regarding Estonia , which is close to Finland .
It is unreasonable that the Union is demanding that the country 's bituminous shale-based production of electric energy , which is unable to compete in a freely competitive market , should swiftly become the object of free competition , while , at the same time , France , and to some extent Germany also , are still , after fifty years , obstructing the liberalisation of their own energy markets .
The other special feature of Estonia concerns its milk quotas , which the Union wishes to fix at a basic level equal to that of the start of the last decade , when Estonia - rightly or wrongly - decreased its production .
The question of Kaliningrad always comes up as a key issue in any talk about enlargement , the northern dimension and our relationship with Russia .
Neither is Kaliningrad - and this is something I want to stress - a crucial element in the problems and opportunities of the northern dimension , which lie elsewhere .
Mr President , may I just say that the whole discussion on this directive shows that there is an urgent need to make laws and rules clearer .
There is a huge misunderstanding about how this is to be interpreted , when Article 4 makes reference to annexes and other things .
However , closer examination and contact with the market participants have clearly revealed a number of problem areas in the original proposal that need amending .
There are many different types of securities for which there are no markets in some Member States .
Companies that wish to remain in their home country will obviously not benefit from this sort of single market and so will have no need for a securities prospectus of this kind .
