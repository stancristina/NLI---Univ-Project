pace that will , in our view , make it possible for ambitious objectives to be achieved in 2004 ?
The same goes for the G90 .
This attitude might even be a smart strategic move because it would put the European Union in a more positive position on agriculture : we would have more room for manoeuvre .
You want to keep the European Union’s initial objectives on the liberalisation of developing countries ’ markets and on the liberalisation of services , with , on the latter , a very significant ambiguity on public services , as we have been reminded .
We deplore this omission because it places a severe strain on the very future of the process .     . – Mr President , I will be very brief .
But we must also denounce those countries which , like France , have created a ‘second flag’ .
Is it in fact reasonable to think that the demand for energy , the corollary of development , can be satisfied by renewable energies in countries like India and China ?
What worries me is that we now seem to want to abandon the Singapore issues too .
I will now respond briefly to a few criticisms .
We are also working on this within the European Union , because we want , as it were in anticipation , to amend our own provision on obligatory licensing in European legislation to bring it into line with the new WTO agreement and possibly allow easier access in a number of developing countries .
International relations , which are based on cooperation and trade between equals and are respectful of individual and collective fundamental rights , deserve better .
The Bam disaster moved the entire world .
In Africa , more than 4 million AIDS sufferers are in desperate need of treatment and only 50 000 people have access to it .
The accessibility of medicines must be guaranteed .
Those five countries now form the Steering Committee of NEPAD.
NEPAD has received very favourable responses from the industrialised countries , particularly from the European Union and the G8 , as we saw last year at Evian , although the resulting aid has not always fulfilled the expectations of the instigating countries .
Yet what has happened to the free movement of workers within the Community of African States ?
You are right , Mrs Prets : cultural diversity is a fight , a fight in our everyday lives , and we are not fighting it alone : we need allies .
It is obvious that within the Union we should preserve our capacity to support our diverse cultures by means of local , regional , national and European funding , and the Commission is committed to the full implementation of Article 151( 4 ) , which makes it compulsory to take into account , horizontally , the cultural diversity within all the other cultures .
Moreover , the Chinese are supporting us within UNESCO .
I am sorry , but I did not really hear the answer to the clear and precise questions contained in this report .
The third reason why I am not very optimistic is that I am not sure that we really are an example for others to follow , even if we like to think that we are .
I should like , in this House as in a court of law , to call as witnesses those venerable languages and cultures which even today are still the subject of discrimination , not only in their respective States but also in our European institutions .     Madam President , you will understand that , owing to the shortage of combatants in the plenary session , I shall not reply to all those who – and at a quarter past midnight I can well understand why – have left the House .
I should like to give you a very specific example , Last May , for the first time we opened the Cannes Film Festival with European Cinema Day .
Our communication of last summer enabled us to get things up and running and to demonstrate that Europe was participating in the drawing up of an international instrument .
I fear that this will mean that we will not see the wood for the trees .
Great importance is also attached to major projects .
One year after the major clash of choices at world level regarding Iraq , we have gained a great deal of experience .
May the Irish Presidency , , take strong action in these different areas that can bring to life the image of a Europe that listens more to the criticism it receives and the hopes that it raises .
The greatest danger for Europe , Mr President , for the Lisbon process and for growth and employment , I am sorry to say , is my former compatriot , Mr Trichet .
It is clear that the European Union will be in a better position to welcome these new members if it already has a constitution .
European ambition is setting the pace , from the draft constitution to the Lisbon process .
Bring Europe out of its rut , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , dare to do it !     .
This management should be done at global level and not with the sole aim of protecting European Union production , as tuna have the annoying habit of not respecting borders and territorial waters .
In our view , it is sufficient to state that services of general interest fall under the competence of the Member States , who choose their missions , their organisation and their limits .     . – Despite all the concessions made by the author of the report to the reactionary political forces working for the privatisation of public services , he now seems to have been overcome by those whose support he wished to obtain
