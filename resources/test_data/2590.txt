well as bringing them into effect .
It seems to us that the list is getting larger and that the burden of proof must remain with those , be they in Member States , in the Commission or in the Scientific Committees , who want us to adapt these things .
I am prepared to accept that some of these are harmless .
Indeed , the committee and even Mr Lannoye were prepared to accept E949 and E650 .
However , whilst I would not claim to be an expert - as no other member of the committee would - on the issue of which of the various propellant sprays can safely be used , enough doubts were raised in committee , not least when we heard from the representative of the Commission , about the propellant sprays themselves .
These are apparently needed by manufacturers because they produce an equal spray of fat on the utensil concerned .
One of them is there only for professional use .
The other two are regarded as safe for all .
We all want to look again at this issue and see why they have been chosen and whether we might now hold back any clearance of them , at least until the review which is suggested has been carried through .
With regard to the two amendments , my Group , whilst it supports the spirit of what Mr Lannoye proposes in Amendment No 1 , would not go as far as this to write the precautionary principle itself into this particular directive .
It does not seem to us to be the right place for it .
We would prefer to strike out recital 5 and we shall so vote .
This is the place to discuss the burden of proof rather than the overall principle of precaution .
Finally , as regards Amendment No 2 in the name of my Group , this is purely a drafting amendment to remove references to the codecision procedure .
But its meaning remains crystal clear .
We do not think these additions should be made unless it can be demonstrated that the consumer benefits .
At the end of the line it is for the consumer that this is being done .
It is being done in the consumer 's name .
For that reason we commend Amendment No 2.
Mr President , item 6 of the Minutes where we modify the agenda for the week is accurate but probably rightly does not mention that voting time on Thursday has been brought forward to 11.30 a.m. because of the large number of amendments tabled to certain reports .
I rise , therefore , to question whether Rule 139( 1 ) of our Rules of Procedure is being applied correctly .
As you know , we spend an enormous amount of time voting on Tuesday , Wednesday and Thursday lunchtimes .
We adopted a set of changes to the Rules of Procedure last year to try to rationalise our work .
In these changes we gave every Member the right to table an amendment as an individual at committee stage , but we limited the right to table amendments in plenary to 32 Members or a political group .
However , if you look at the amendments that have been tabled on Thursday , for instance to the Dimitrakopoulos-Leinen report , you will see that there are over 100 amendments which are tabled by individuals , supposedly in the name of their political group , but this may well not be the case .
I notice , for instance , that the EPP Group has over 100 amendments in its name but signed by 18 different Members , none of them the coordinator or leader of the group .
Over 20 of these amendments are contradictory , so they cannot possibly all be the position of the EPP Group .
Some are identical , tabled by different Members ; and there is even a case of two identical amendments being tabled by the same Member .
Could the EPP Group please get its act together !
So much time is spent and wasted on voting as it is and this is a way to get around the rationalisation of the Rules of Procedure we adopted as a Parliament last year .
Amendments must either be tabled in the name of 32 Members or in the name of a political group and actually represent the position of that political group , not of the individual who happens to table them in the name of the group so as to circumvent the limitation on tabling rules in plenary .
I would ask the sessional services to verify in future that such amendments really are in the name of a group .

Mr President , I should just like to let Mr Corbett know that within the EPP Group an amendment cannot be put before Parliament unless it has been voted in the Group and has the support of the Group .
He should be quite clear about that procedure within our Group .
Secondly , as he is aware , there is a process going on at the moment for reforming Parliament .
If he has any suggestions to put to the Bureau about the voting procedures , that would be the correct way to go about it .
Mr President , I was present yesterday and I signed the register but my name does not appear in the Minutes .
I should like that to be corrected .
Mr President , on a point of order .
It concerns a reference made yesterday by the President on the change of business which is taking place this week .
I am very concerned indeed about the reference that the President made as to who would be present from the Council when the President of Austria attends this Parliament tomorrow .
