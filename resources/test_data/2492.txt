particularly with those countries that represent tax have ns .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the theme of good tax governance has always been very important but has become even more relevant since the great economic and financial crisis that struck our continent about two years ago .
The destruction of the smallest and most defenceless individuals in the shape of unborn children cannot be considered a way of confirming women 's dignity and freedom .
The assumption that women must be able to achieve easier abortions in order to recover their right to sexual freedom not only runs counter to general lay morals , but also contradicts the principles enshrined in recital Z , which states that the promotion of 'higher birth rates to meet future requirements ' is central to the European action .
I fully agree with the approach of the resolution , which agrees with the Commission recommendation and supports the opening of negotiations with the FYROM , in the conviction that this is an essential step for the development of that country and for the stability of a region crucial to the interests of the European Union .
This relationship is currently mediated by certain magic terms that have not yet entered into the vocabulary of the European Commission .
We all welcomed the birth of the new Europe in Lisbon with hope .
( The President cut off the speaker ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this is a classic subject on which European institutions are staking their reputation with industrialists , with workers and with European consumers .
Every European citizen expects all of us , Commission and Parliament , to demonstrate political sensitivity .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as has already been said , needle-stick and other sharp injuries are among the most common risks faced by healthcare workers in Europe , and they therefore represent a serious problem both for the healthcare sector and for society in general .
The aim of this Commission proposal is to allow the Council to implement the framework agreement signed by the European Hospital and Healthcare Employers ' Association and the European Federation of Public Service Unions .
Lastly , I call on the Commission to oversee the application of this agreement and to regularly update Parliament , which often focuses on this issue , so as to ensure that the agreement is monitored properly and that the need for any future amendments is examined in depth .
However , the situation of Muslim women in the world today , including in Europe , is tragic .
The first reason is to provide transparent information on the security and confidentiality of the sensitive data that the Commission will have to receive periodically in order to manage energy policy effectively .
I consider it positive that a compromise has been reached to ensure that the data of operators in the market will be received and processed by the Commission with the necessary confidentiality guaranteed .
I merely wished to take the floor and to take advantage of this opportunity so as to broach the subject of fisheries , but by going beyond the normal Green Paper - and the White Paper that has been announced for June - and addressing the needs that exist in relation to Europe 's seas , and to the Mediterranean in particular .
We believe , however , that it is essential to provide for greater investment in scientific research , especially in the fisheries sector , including within the next framework programme .
It is therefore important to ensure that the data that is gathered and managed safeguards the confidentiality and the activities of businesses .
I believe that intervention is necessary and that the lack of consistent data and information on investment projects should be remedied .
Upon reading the text , I note an unfortunate weakness - perhaps not for the politics of diplomacy , but certainly for that of values - and that is the lack of determination when criticising the well-known aspects that make the UNHCR a very controversial body .
This is a controversial issue that must be addressed in the coming months , once we are sure that we can count on having the necessary financial resources .
It also criticises certain inefficiencies of the network and advocates improved information for citizens and businesses , who are often unaware that this structure exists .
I agree with the importance attached by the Commission and the Member States to launching a communication strategy on consumer rights via web portals , awareness-raising campaigns and information points , while also promoting use of the 'eYouGuide ' website , and , at the same time , ensuring the reliability , credibility and impartiality of the organisations responsible for management and organisation .
Promoting transparency of data with an interactive online database increases awareness of standards , enables problems to be resolved faster and increases trust in operators .
I voted in favour , since anti-competitive conditions encourage abuses of dominant positions to the detriment of SMEs and it is therefore vital that Europe does its best to provide greater guarantees and protection for goods .
For all the above reasons , which are clearly explained in the report , I voted in favour .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that there is an original sin in the subject that we are debating this evening , and that is the secrecy with which the negotiations have been carried out up to now .
However , this agreement is giving rise to serious threats , which are alarming the public , and the Commission must , of course , be aware of this .
However , Sri Lanka had no 'guardians' , if we may call them such , in the Council , and so the decision was taken .
