some governments are refusing to apply something which they agreed on three years ago .
One month before the deadline and we only have two countries with the legislation .
That is because there are huge problems in their parliaments .
Governments need to be criticised for failing to honour their obligations .
I shall tell you what we have done in practice for mainstreaming over the last two years .
And we can take it for granted that these often involve real acrobatics at the level of subsidiarity .
I leave it to you to assess the reactions of the ministers for education to interventions by European legislation in education and of the ministers for health and welfare to interventions by European legislation in health and welfare and social systems .
Mr Pronk criticised me because I demonstrated courage and because , with so many clashes , I proposed article 13 on equality of the sexes and because I have arguments for one and not for the other .
With the second step , I think every Member of the European Parliament has been following not the clash , but the furious attack at the mere announcement of the proposal .
I can assure you that I had no problem whatsoever with being the good Commissioner , compared to all the other bad Commissioners who rejected the directive in question .
For that I should like to thank our rapporteur .
On the other hand , however , there are also extremely dangerous points in keeping with the more general policy of commercialising everything .
The most worrying of all is that the suggested criterion for measuring the success of each research activity is if it has a positive economic result , while the introduction of a corresponding evaluation system is proposed in paragraph 37 .
Nonetheless , the Commission must obviously continue to see its job through to the end .
Similarly , as far as regional policy is concerned , although it is not a strictly legislative matter , I want to point out that the Commission needs to present the third report on cohesion as quickly as possible , so that the European Parliament has an opportunity to take a position on this very important issue before the European elections .     . – For several years now , the ΕU has been systematically promoting the penetration of big business into a series of sectors in public ownership and under public control ( energy , telecommunications , railways , post offices and so on ) .
The report by the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy laments the delay and threatens fire and brimstone in the event of non-compliance .
I should therefore like to ask for the Minutes to be corrected .
However , I must register a complaint about the fact that a proposal made by the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy for cofinancing the cost of these measures was rejected .
The fact that it is certain that jobs will be lost and small and medium-sized companies will close has also been ignored .
The objective is to increase their excessive profits by abolishing seamen 's fundamental rights .
Not a reference to the fact that regional decisions about the safety of ships essentially weaken the role of the International Maritime Organisation and undermine the safety rules within the framework of an economic war and race for profit .
A mass , dynamic , grass-roots movement needs to develop against these policies to grab public assets and impose a mediaeval working regime and slave wages .     Mr President , having congratulated Mrs Miguélez Ramos on the work she has done , I should like to clarify what this is about , because certain misunderstandings have perhaps arisen .
In this sense , I think that this is an absolutely positive initiative .
They have been voiced by Mr Folias and by Mr Jarzembowski .
I therefore call on the Commissioner , because the industry really is worried , to assure us today that the Commission will submit this study as quickly as possible and that it will cover the concerns of industry about the functioning of competition in ports from now on .     Mr President , today , with the report by Mr Jarzembowski , whom I should like to congratulate on the lengthy efforts he has made to bring us to this point , we are essentially doing no more than what we did when Parliament called for postal services to be opened up to competition , railway services to be opened up to competition and air transport to be opened up to competition .
It would be strange if this Parliament , which has been at the vanguard of opening up these services , came along tomorrow and said , for incomprehensible reasons – to me at least – that there must be an exception from this long line of action to open up all these services to competition and that the exception was port services .
Protecting employment rights , where there is an express provision in the directive that we cannot have a lower level of protection than that which exists in each Member State .
As you said , unfortunately the irregularities – which provoked my question in the first round – were repeated during the elections in Himara the other day , with a real orgy of violence , injury , bombings against candidates and so on .
Information for and health education of citizens on the prevention and timely detection of symptoms which give danger signals , together with reliable screening , have brought about positive results , such as , for example , with breast cancer , which affects a large percentage of women of reproductive age .
Even saying the word 'cancer ' is avoided in numerous countries
