seed market , then there has to be a certain level of quality , and there should be close scrutiny to ensure that seeds on sale are of the declared quality .
We need to be careful to avoid a situation whereby whatever is in the gene banks comes into our market and destroys it - the world market and the European market alike .
Madam President , I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for a successful report .
However , we must guard against losing confidence in the certification system by allowing absolutely anything under the sun to be accredited .
Certifiable seed types should be those intended for cultivation .
One of the purposes of certification must be to test out new types of seed that are resistant to plant diseases in order to reduce the use of crop sprays .
Inspectors will have to be authorized by the state .
There is some cause for concern at developments tending towards the random awarding of inspection contracts .
Mr President , during the part-session in Strasbourg in February , a significant step was taken towards healthier feedingstuffs .
This was secured by the European Parliament voting in favour of an amendment - of which I was the author - to the Poisson report on a ban covering the use of antibiotics in feedingstuffs with specific nutritional purposes .
As stated earlier in this debate , the use of antibiotics carries the inherent danger of bacteria becoming resistant .
We are courting a situation where many people will die from diseases that could easily have been treated with antibiotics .
An important point for future agricultural policy reform will be to ensure that regulations on animal husbandry will render the use of antibiotics superfluous .
These analyses demonstrate that the use of antibiotics can be extremely costly in terms of treating human diseases .
One of the EU 's distinctive marks is the free movement of goods .
This implies that we have a responsibility and a duty to assure consumers that goods are produced responsibly .
Consumers should be able to choose EU products confidently without having to worry about whether production methods could wreak havoc on citizens ' health , a catastrophe that could result in many more deaths than the BSE crisis , with far more widespread impact .
In this regard , we must not forget that the EU is part of the world market , too .
Of course it is important to tighten up EU regulations .
I have three main requests .
My second main point is that at the earliest possible opportunity , the Commission should prepare a list of the most harmful types of antibiotic growth stimulants and have them banned .
I would like to encourage the Commissioner and the Commission to begin focusing on alternative methods of animal husbandry to replace and render superfluous the present consumption of antibiotic growth stimulants .
The European Parliament must help ensure that healthy food will not become a meaningless phrase .
Secondly , when can we expect tangible results from research into the use of antibiotics in animal feed ?
What types of monitoring and preventative measures has the Commission introduced in the meantime ?
Thirdly , is the Commission currently working on a revision of the relevant directive on the use of antibiotics in animal feed ?
Today , we are voting on a joint motion for a resolution .
We are taking a somewhat cautious step , but it is a step in the right direction towards better , healthier food .
If Sweden and Finland - and Denmark , too , where these matters have also been considered - wish to maintain a ban on antibiotics , will the Commission permit the EU Court of Justice to judge in these matters , or what exactly did you have in mind ?
I , too , concur with this .
I can also agree with a further three points .
Action is notable by its absence when it comes to the will to prevent conflicts , for example in the Balkans , as we have heard .
I , too , would like to draw attention to the importance of proper Parliamentary involvement , if this is to be considered a project of the people .
However , there are points I must disagree with .
Naturally , I must distance myself from that .
The Amsterdam Treaty describes what could practically be called the prospects of welding together the foreign policies of Member States - as Mr Cook , the Foreign Secretary , said previously - while respecting the wishes of each individual country .
New security structures alone do not produce results ; the crucial factor is the will of the Member States .
Mr President , by way of introduction I would like to say that safeguarding animal welfare is indeed paramount .
And that is precisely why I cannot support Mr Pimenta 's rejection of the proposal for an agreement with the USA .
I believe we should recommend the agreement and the REX Committee .
Secondly , the consequences of the agreement in the USA and , of course , in the EU must be considered .
The alternative to the agreement with the USA is not some other agreement with better standards .
Mrs Pollack used the word 'insulting ' , and this is the crux of the matter .
Why ?
It applies only to 13 species , as opposed to the 19 covered by the new agreement .
As I have stated before , it is hypocritical to focus on this one - albeit barbaric - trapping method , while traps that are no less cruel are used within the EU.
That - not more stringent requirements for traps - is the alternative to the agreements with Russia , Canada and now also the USA
