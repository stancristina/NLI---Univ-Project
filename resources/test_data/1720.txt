But there are particular features , hyper-regionality , underdevelopment , concentration of the population in some centres and desertion of some other areas , and the various funds , programmes and Community initiatives take no account of these particularities so that the respective needs may be dealt with appropriately .
Unless the problem is dealt with in that way , by a radical approach to Community policy on the issues of economic and social cohesion and the development of countries and regions , we will no doubt come back and debate more reports , but with no result .
I would like to mention a number of points , mainly in order to draw various conclusions about the future , because the past , what happened in 1994 or 1995 or 1996 , is something we should bear in mind when considering the review of Structural Fund regulations .
The second point I want to mention is the monitoring and implementation of supplementarity .
This is certainly a positive step , which will contribute towards the prevention or correction of certain mistakes , but mainly towards the qualitative improvement of the new programmes for the future .
I know the Commission attributes great importance to that , and as Parliament , that satisfies us .
Besides monetary union , economic union too remains outstanding , economic government as some people call it .
What proposals will you bring us for the budget in the future ?
No country will give up resources and sovereignty for another country , but only for a political whole .
It will therefore be necessary for you to try a new Intergovernmental Conference or to postpone enlargement .
Looking , first , at the issue of employment , it is worth stressing the balanced line pursued by this Treaty , despite the fact that the new provisions on employment could have been more ambitious .
The Amsterdam Agreement did not solve the institutional issue , which it refers to new negotiations at the beginning of the new millennium , and I hope that those amendments will be based on the ideas upon which the ideal of the building of Europe was based , and that counterproductive and artificial discriminations between the Members will be avoided .
Traditional refractoriness prevailed once more in Amsterdam , and no provisions were adopted that would allow the Union to develop its own role .
Madam President , if we were able to distil the maximum benefit from the DNA technologies and at the same time control the associated dangers , we would have found the best way to support investment in that sector .
In part , this reflects the fact that by definition biotechnology includes the application of technology to living organisms , including man .
In the case of DNA technology , precisely because the gene or the cell or the human body and its respective parts pre-exist when they are discovered , there is no 'invention ' and there can consequently be no protection by patent .
In contrast , its use , which could lead via new techniques to the production of a new substance with biomechanical applications , certainly is an object for legal protection .
Overall , and subject to the reservations expressed by what I have said , which I hope will be taken into account because there are amendments related to it , I am in favour of the motion for a directive , because the legal protection conferred by this directive will contribute to protection for biotechnology , which will encourage its continual expansion into areas with an important impact on health and disease , nutrition , environmental protection , agriculture and other important areas of human life and activity .
One of the main aspects of this review is risk assessment , of course with the related classification , so that parallelism can be achieved with the corresponding administrative procedures for granting permits for the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment .
That , because in the latter case the balance of the ecosystem could be affected , as also could competitiveness , granted that farmers depend on certain companies which hold patents on the genetically modified plant but also on the insecticide to which it is resistant .
This , because transfers of pollen may take place , when as is quite natural , new varieties of the same plant will emerge which , however , may have different and perhaps undesirable properties .
Secondly , how does it relate the classification of risk with administrative procedures ?
Where the question of insurance is concerned I am in general agreement with the rapporteur .
Only in that way can their confidence be gained .
Mr President , today we are debating some of the most important aspects of the complete liberalization of telecommunications from 1 January 1998 , and also various dramatic side effects of that liberalization , such as its effect on the numbering system .
So definitive decisions about the sector were taken mainly at a political level , while dangerous disregard was shown for the role and contribution of relevant international bodies such as the International Telecommunications Association and the European Conference of Post Offices and Telecommunications , in the development of telecommunications and the necessary international cooperation .
It is the Commission 's duty to coordinate its intervention in international bodies so that , to whatever extent may still be possible today , critical problems of coordination and international cooperation can be dealt with after this degree of market liberalization .
Everyone is entitled to use both ideological and political arguments to establish his position .
The second point is that its approach is realistic in relation to the upper tax limit , and this will contribute towards reaching agreement with the Council .
Mr. President , may I ask you to note that in
