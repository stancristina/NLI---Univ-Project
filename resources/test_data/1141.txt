putting on electronic file and controlling ( in other words , hunting ) the persecuted seeking refuge on our continent , controls will be carried out on charities , to make sure they are not financing terrorists and , of course , on extreme religious and political persuasions .
Every country will be controlled and recommendations will be made to any which do not comply .
The peoples have the power to ruin their plans .     .
Our basic objection , however , concerns how fundamental rights , such as the right to work , free health care , education , welfare and so on are addressed .
Mr President , successful corporate governance is bound up with a reduction in security in cross-border investments and an increase in the mobility of capital .
It is a pity that , whenever we try to join forces with the productive system and employment interests , there is a rallying against such proposals , as if they represented a mortal danger .
Finally , for the same reasons , special care must be taken to address methods which result in shareholders ' being cheated out of their votes , as happens with arrangements which allow for the informal organisation of systems for the representation of shareholders by large anonymous groups .
The most important is that it will send out a clear message to the citizens in both the present and in the new Member States , demonstrating that the European Union is both willing and able to set appropriate conditions for the real free movement of persons , the cornerstone of which is the coordination of social security systems .
As regards the two amendments within the framework of the second reading , they clearly improve the quality of the text and the Commission can therefore accept them in full .
In addition , I can assure you that the Commission is also in a position to accept some of the remaining concerns and considerations expressed by certain members of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs at second reading , within the framework of the proposal for a new executive regulation which the Commission will submit by the end of this year .
The simplification and modernisation of the present regulation are the basic to the promotion of the mobility of labour in the Union .
I do not intend to enumerate all the improvements which the new rules will bring about compared with the present regulation , but we can focus our attention very briefly on three issues .
This provision is particularly important for cross-border workers .
In addition , agencies will be required to reply within a reasonable period of time to all questions and to provide citizens with any information requested in order to exercise their rights .
His intervention is an insult and , if I may say so , is unseemly towards the political forces of Cyprus and the Cypriot people as a whole , who do not need lessons in good behaviour from the President of the European Parliament or anyone else .
It is therefore making a victim out of the attacker .
As the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece have repeatedly requested this of you , could you tell us when you intend to do this ?     . –Madam President , I asked for the floor in order to inform the House that the Pakistani authorities have allowed the crew of the to return to their homes in Greece and the Philippines .
The bitterly cold weather which hit Greece a few months ago caused extensive damage to farm assets ( plants , land and so on ) throughout the country .
I would also emphasise the findings in the report on the treatment of the master of the and the fact that this sort of treatment was also seen later , in Pakistan , with the crew of the , a matter on which Parliament passed a resolution .
The translator , by adding a phrase which does not exist in Mr Sterckx 's text , presents the master as maintaining exactly the opposite of what he actually maintained and agreeing with the action taken by the Spanish authorities .
To close , I wish to express my faith in what I would call absolute cooperation with the ΙΜΟ .     – Mr President , the paradox in the European Union when we discuss safety at sea is that the Member States call for measures following disasters and then fail to apply them .
It is also the maintenance of ships , as demonstrated by the recent shipwreck of the double-hull cargo vessel , the ,off the coast of Norway , it is that we do not have ports of refuge , in violation of Community legislation , it is that we do not conduct proper port controls , again in violation of Community legislation .
We all recognised in the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism that the European Commission 's proposal was generally positive , but that there was room for improvement .
Our rapporteur handled the subject extremely well , demonstrating how close he is to transport workers .
In our opinion , the volume of controls required needs to stand in logical proportion to the volume of results anticipated .
Congratulations once again to both the European Commission and Mrs de Palacio and our rapporteur Mr Markov.     . – I trust that the proposal for a directive on consumer credit which we are debating will provide a solution for the benefit of consumers and will put a stop to this unacceptable situation which functions like an El Dorado for the credit institutions .
This information must also list the actual annual rate of interest , the eventual cost of contracting the agreement , the number and amount of the instalments and the total cost of the loan .
