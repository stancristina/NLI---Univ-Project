In reality , Mr Sturdy , and you know I like you a lot , we have a philosophical divergence over this .
It is not enough , as the Committee on Agriculture proposes - and even if it is fair - to oppose the reduction in premiums for cereals .
As for durum wheat , I should like to draw your attention to Amendment No 5 , which we tabled and adopted in committee , for durum wheat areas to be set at an inter-regional level .
Mr Ford , you are a provocateur ! ( Mixed reactions )
Amsterdam , Mr President-in-Office , should not just be the title of a Brel song , but it should be a hit .
The tools that have been created - I am sorry , Mr President-in-Office - are intergovernmental .
If we do not make enough progress in another week , let us work another two or three months over the summer so that three or four vital questions can be resolved ; a more serious treaty could then be signed .
The States have the necessary means but are balking at committing themselves and are rejecting democratic controls .
As for the institutions themselves , we regret that a few days before the Summit there are still doubts on important points .
When we see these cares and cautions , which are rather ridiculous , it has to be said , about the draft treaty , in order to skirt around the basic question of the viability of the single currency , we cannot help thinking of JeanJacques Rousseau 's words : ' It is the weapon that must be left in the wound , in case the victim expires when it is taken out ' .
The first , is the chapter on employment .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we are worried .
Madam President , on principle and for the sake of sexual equality , I shall make no reference to kitchen equipment , cooking utensils or meals - I leave that to the men .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , at the end of this debate I should like to make it clear , on behalf of the French socialists , that we are attached to European construction , we want to see Amsterdam give it a new lease of life , and we hope that all of our efforts will make it possible to stick to the original timetables .
It is an important act for our fellow citizens , proof of practical construction of a Europe of citizens .
Yet the latest developments of the debate on summer-time , launched recently by the last French Government , seem to indicate that the Commission is no longer content with indicating the dates and times for the switch to summer-time , but also is judging whether or not it should be applied to the whole of the Union .
Faced with the draft Treaty presented at the Amsterdam European Council , the European Parliament is pretending to be sorry that the text is not sufficiently federalist .
Unfortunately , the record of CFSP is rather disappointing and current events do nothing to belie that .
The Spencer report on the CFSP is a very good one , but less than two hours ago , we approved an absolutely abominable document , which sanctions the absence of any hope that there might be in this area at the Amsterdam summit .
We know that in the European Parliament there is a big majority for that .
Wishing , for the sake of CFSP , to deny those realities can only do a disservice to the very aim being sought : affirming Europe 's place on the new international arena .
It must be noted that the national parliaments are very much excluded from European legislative procedures , including in areas within their remits originating in constituent powers , which sometimes causes serious problems in an atmosphere of defiance against the cause of European integration prevailing in most Member States .
Transparency has never been the key word of European construction .
What does fraud represent ? 5-10 % of the European Union budget , according to estimates , or even more .
Europe 's credibility in the eyes of its ordinary citizens is at stake .
I do not say this for Mrs Moreau , but I think that when we speak of human rights we also speak of democracy and our aim is also to ensure that the world does not become one big Singapore , with development but no democracy .
We insist very much on this point .
The European Parliament 's message in its report is a clear one .
Placing the European Union 's research policy under the same sign as sustainable development , as Mr Marset Campos is not far from doing in his report , and proposing that the idea should dominate our research programme as massively as he suggests , would be a mistake .
The Commission has specified very clearly that the European voluntary service does not replace the national military or civilian services .
This should help us to find new creative forms of work .
I am afraid that the real aim of this project is to make us forget mass unemployment provoked by a European deflationary policy and the unbridled opening up of our borders .
We are offering voluntary work , financed from taxation , whereas the demand for company jobs is insufficient .
A thousand projects , covering the whole of Europe from Iceland to southern Spain , have been selected by the national agencies and the Commission , according to the criteria of the general interest of the activities proposed and the personalized training for young volunteers .
It will also be on the Internet so that it can easily be consulted on the Europa server .
