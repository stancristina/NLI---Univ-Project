I hope we can achieve the objectives , with which I am in agreement and which are to be found in Parliament 's report .
I should like to thank Parliament for the interest it has shown and also draw attention to the personal contacts that exist between members of the European Parliament and the Asian parliaments .
Asia is not only huge in terms of area .
This has been achieved , however .
In anticipation of the forthcoming ASEM summit in Copenhagen , it must be crystal clear that there is full support for maintaining and developing relations between the EU , the ASEM countries and Asia as a whole .
With regard to the global campaign against terror , it is also important for the EU to forge sound alliances with the Asian countries .
More extensive relations between the EU and Asia must also play their part in supporting the market economy and sustainable development and , in that way , promoting a prosperous Asia .
Simply take a look at recent history and the examples of Japan and Taiwan and it will quickly be very obvious that democracy , the market economy and respect for human rights are the way forward .
It is of course gratifying to hear the Commissioner confirm that the EU is to open an office in Taipei within a year .
Braving possible accusations from Mr Ford , I regret that Taiwan cannot participate in the ASEM Meeting , for example as an observer .
In my view , every democracy in the world should have a place in these international institutions .
I would join in the praise of Mr Maaten 's excellent report .
It must be remembered that all this activity was certainly not a foregone conclusion .
That is an achievement in itself .
It is very important , and vital as well to our economic well-being in this part of the world .
I would mention the first six meetings that are to take place under the Danish Presidency : the big ASEM Meeting , the meetings of business leaders and of ministers of economic affairs , as well as the summits with Japan , China , South Korea and India which are all to take place in Copenhagen during the Presidency .
Over and above these , there is a range of contacts at ministerial level and among officials .
Basic conditions such as respect for human rights , the promotion of democracy and the principles of a state based on the rule of law are central themes in the EU 's relations with Asian countries , and I can assure Mr Messner and others that we shall raise the Tibet issue at the summit with China .
In my view , the activities we have under way are , then , particularly wide-ranging .
If it comes to making a list , there have of course been very many examples of practical progress , some of them of benefit to our citizens .
I have also heard Mr Patten say that relations with South-East Asia are an area in which we could well do more .
The communication on relations with South-East Asia , mooted by Mr Patten , may prove to be a valuable contribution to the debate .
I can give an assurance that the Council shares the desire to strengthen relations between the EU and Asia .
With all the activities mentioned and with everything which has been said here in Parliament and which , I know , is taken note of in the countries we wish to cooperate with , there is a particularly sound basis for the range of activities we are now getting under way under the Danish Presidency .
I myself took part in the first meeting here in Strasbourg , and I look forward to its being possible to arrange something .
Illegal immigration is a considerable problem for the EU 's Member States and an issue that occupies their populations a good deal .
There was agreement that the measures taken in the short or long term for the joint management of migration flows must strike a fair balance .
At the same time , our policy must involve resolute action to combat illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings .
The measures to which the honourable Member refers are legislation adopted by the individual Member States as national measures for combating the problems faced .
I should like to refer to Article 51( 1 ) of the Charter , affirming that the Member States are bound by the Charter when they are implementing Union law and only when they are implementing Union law .
There is generally no question of the regulations to which the honourable Member refers being adopted in implementation of Union law , and I do not therefore think that there is any point in asking me to assess whether the measures taken by the Member States are in accordance with the Charter .
The Charter is of a different character .
Wearing my other hat as Danish Minister for Integration , I should like to say , however , that , when it comes to Danish legislation in this field , it complies fully with all the international standards .
I should also like to add that what the question says is false in certain respects .
There are conditions governing the circumstances under which a permanent residence permit can be obtained solely on the grounds of marriage , and that is something quite different .
I can assure Mr Staes , when he talks about Danish legislation , that we are up to speed on the conventions .
I was myself the European Parliament 's human rights spokesman in 1998 and 1999 .
The reports are there to be found and read .
I have no intention of infringing
