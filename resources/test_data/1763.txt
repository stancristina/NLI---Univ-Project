transpired in the past .
The same is true of social security insurance .
All of them are needed for social cohesion , employability and personal development .
My concern was with something to which the Commission draft does not yet give much emphasis , namely better provision for disadvantaged groups , such as people with disabilities , the long-term unemployed and those who dropped out of school early , all of whom find difficulties placed in their way when it comes to acquiring new skills on their own initiative .
Striking a positive note , I would like to observe that this will provide a frame of reference for key competences , which make it possible for people to adapt themselves to a changing labour market in a knowledge-based society .
The Committee for Employment and Social Affairs shared my objections , and I was very glad to see my colleagues – many of whom are present today – submitting proposals and , apart from three abstentions , voting unanimously to adopt this report .
Public services have an essential part to play in the quality of life enjoyed by individual citizens ; they also have a key role in the European Union’s Lisbon Strategy .
The essential message that must be carried by this debate is ‘flexibility where it is needed , protection where it is possible’ .
The Commission really must overcome the competition Commissioner’s antipathy – and yes , I know that will be quite a feat – and sort out once and for all a number of things that will otherwise have to be left to the European Court of Justice .
Such is indisputably not the case as regards the services we are discussing today , so any European regulation in this field would be a flagrant breach of the subsidiarity principle , and , moreover , of the principles – integral to the rule of law – of necessity and proportionality if there was any interference in the functioning structures that the Member States have developed over the years .
Europe , though , must always be asking itself what added value accrues from action at the European level , and in what way it benefits the public .
Your proposals on health services , in which patient mobility is to be treated as more important than basic care , have their own tale to tell ; they show how illusory is the belief that the market can guarantee fundamental rights .
Those of us who have spent many years in local and regional politics will be aware that , as far as the public are concerned , politics begins at their own front door , and so subsidiarity requires that the right of communities to manage their own affairs , and hence the powers of local authorities , should not , despite the complexity of European structures , be tampered with .
This , for example , involves the promotion of networking and mutual learning not only at the European level , but also across borders , and at the national , regional , and local levels .
Along with more than a million other Europeans , we have supported the OneSeat.eu initiative , and , together with the citizens , we will also continue to advocate relocating Parliament 's activities from Strasbourg to Brussels .     – Mr President , study abroad and distance learning are becoming increasingly popular , not least thanks to millions of Euro worth of EU subsidies .
I do not think that this is justified .
If these reforms , which must be continued with full commitment after 1 January 2007 , are not made , then the safeguard clauses will come into effect .
The accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the EU on 1 January 2007 will continue the integration in Europe that is unparalleled in the world .
There were very many people who said : Germany has just destroyed our country twice , and now we are supposed to welcome it into our Community ?
Whilst welcoming the new States , however , we must make it clear that each enlargement only works if the rules are observed .
It is also important to make it clear that these are the preconditions for progress .
As if it were not enough that the Commission has been very generous in its interpretation with regard to Turkey thus far , now the deadline for the recognition of Cyprus is to be extended once again , in the vague hope that Turkey may yet meet it .
Regarding the Kurdish question , as has already been said , no one in this House has any sympathy for terrorism , and the PKK should declare its lasting support for the peace process once and for all .
Yet even a privileged partnership requires that the Copenhagen criteria be met and the reforms be driven forward , particularly in the interests of the Turkish population itself .
Our Turkish partners are confronted with an assortment of bad examples .
I should like to say to Mrs De Keyser that this is not what I understand by ‘clarity’ .
What we feared last year has come true .
Then nothing will change in that country .     – Mr President , as this debate draws to a close , I should like to remind the House once more that Mr Eurlings has presented a good , constructive report , even if it has not been seen that way and has been criticised in Turkey .
Is ‘Schengen plus ’ a necessary requirement for the implementation of Schengen II ?
It should not be taken for granted , however , as permanent measures are needed to keep it that way .
It would make particular sense to increase the provision of information in each of the regions in which increasing numbers of fakes – counterfeit money – have been found
