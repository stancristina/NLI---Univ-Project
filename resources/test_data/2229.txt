We shall be transformed into an electoral district instead of a nation .
The June Movement does not want to reduce democracy .
Our mission is a Europe of democracies in which each country cooperates closely , but which only adopts common laws on issues which transcend borders .
Air pollution and marine pollution are problems which we cannot solve individually .
The EU should not be able to forbid a country from banning pesticides and colourings which cause allergies .
I think there are many sensible things in this report .
There is no doubt that we in Parliament will have to exert pressure if it is to succeed .
Some decisions still require unanimity and some countries , including Denmark , still have reservations about participating in supranational cooperation , for example in the area of refugees and asylum .
I would like to stress that it is also part of democracy that people in nation states can form an opinion on these things on the basis of how they see them , and that only the people themselves can change the decisions they have made .
The rapporteur is very concerned about a multi-speed Europe , meaning that countries opt out of some areas of cooperation , or that a group of countries begin to cooperate more closely .
I too can see that this danger exists , but sometimes it is necessary , not least when more countries join in cooperation , to respect the fact that there may be different speeds within that cooperation .
I think we should be aware that the pragmatic cooperation we need to have , at the same time as our visions , may also make it necessary for there to be different speeds .
Mr President , the June Movement can only applaud the fact that the Committee on Development has taken the initiative to produce a report investigating the connections between the Overseas Countries and Territories , the ACP States in Africa , the Caribbean and the Pacific , and the ultraperipheral regions of the European Union .
There is an advantage in promoting decentralised and regional cooperation among the OCTs themselves and with the ACP States , because this can help promote their development .
We neither can nor should sit in Strasbourg and dictate what this cooperation should be aimed at .
Secondly , the countries themselves naturally have the best understanding of the local conditions .
And we should also ensure in the negotiations on international trade that we maintain the trading privileges enjoyed by the OCTS and the ACP States .
In that way , we shall also promote the thing on which all our discussion of development should be focused , namely the fight against poverty .
The Council rejected the idea , but that does not mean there is anything wrong with it .
There is uncertainty in particular regarding the question of ethics , the benefits to society and the long-term consequences for the environment and health .
The Commission 's proposal tightens up the procedures in many ways .
This is all very good .
But the same proposal will exclude products covered by other Community legislation in such a way that there will only be an environmental risk assessment .
This could lead to GMO products evading the thorough controls , time limits and evaluation proposed in this directive .
I am also concerned about the new , simplified procedures which make it easier to release or market certain GMOs .
Our experience is too limited and too uncertain in the area of GMOs .
It contains genuine conflicts between European industry and its desire to catch up with the USA and the more cautious environmental approach expressed through the application of the precautionary principle .
In my view , a great deal can be achieved through open discussion , not least with interested citizens - without of course revealing commercial secrets - and through careful and preferably rapid handling by the authorities .
I personally belong to the group which supports the Commission 's seven-year rule but not the simplified procedure , although a simplified procedure could become a possibility if we considered a renewal of the marketing authorisation for the products , in other words extending the seven years .
One of the problems in connection with the complex procedure is that decisions are made through a committee procedure in which Parliament has no influence .
We have seen in the past that this creates conflicts later on , and it would therefore be desirable if the process could begin now .
We hope it will be possible to find some form of sensible compromise tomorrow - in my view preferably with as tight a timetable as possible .
Mr President , problems with end-of-life vehicles which are to be scrapped are largely due to the way they are produced .
That brings us to PVC.
As we know , PVC is not the solution of the future , even though in the material it sends us , the PVC industry tries to distort the Swedish PVC action plan , for example , so as to persuade us that the Swedes think PVC is a health product which everyone should have more of .
PVC has a wide range of applications , but its disposal creates environmental problems .
Incinerated PVC produces dioxins , which are among the most dangerous toxins that exist .
Every time that PVC is involved in a proposal for a directive , we are told that this problem in particular cannot be looked at on its own or vertically , but that we should look at it globally and horizontally , and that the Commission will do the thinking for us .
As far as I am aware , it has been meaning to do so since the 1980s .
Today the Commission must tell us when it will take an initiative
