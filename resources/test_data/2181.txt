This means maintaining the functional integration of the railway while ensuring political and judicial independence .
I have to say that personally I would be very worried if Amendment No 49 were carried , as this would destroy the entire proposal .
The explanation lies in the fact that the major trunk routes used by lorries in France linking Mediterranean countries with Northern and Eastern Europe have now reached full capacity .
Sadly , we have already seen many examples of this , from the collapse of Sabena and that of Air Lib , to the state of the railways in Britain I remain a strong advocate for the provision of a high-quality European public service .
I do not support the view that we should restrict ourselves simply to creating a rail market .
Voting in favour of this report amounts to behaving like a vulgar lobbyist for those private interests who want to do away with the public service railways .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would welcome your views on this .
Let the Commission publish the accounts detailing the huge direct and indirect , acknowledged and unacknowledged subsidies that the European Union and the Member States grant to the aviation and aeronautics sectors and their shareholders !
It entails the risk that profitable trans-European lines would be monopolised by a number of big operators , while less profitable secondary networks would be left to small operators .
It is my belief that liberalisation would leave us with nothing but a cemetery filled with passengers !
It does not however take a clear stand against privatisation and competition or against the consequent dismantling of a public service .
( FR ) First of all I would like to express my satisfaction with the report by Mr Markov supporting the Commission proposal of October 2001 for a new regulation on road transport .
.
It is insufficient to reduce the weekly driving time , which is currently set at 56 hours , to 45 hours .
Furthermore , Parliament voted for an amendment which revealed that the Union would henceforth be based on the legitimacy , not of the 'peoples ' ( each taken as a whole ) , but of the 'citizens ' ( taken individually ) .
This speech does indeed , therefore , concern the agenda .
If we want a UN position , we must also say what must be decided at the Security Council ; we cannot always hide behind the Security Council without specifying what it should decide .
That amounts to telling dictators in every country to hurry up and get nuclear weapons , so that , that way , we will not do anything more to them and will negotiate with them .
They must take on the entire risk and until they are forced to shoulder their responsibility , all the responsibility , they will do whatever they like .
I shall stop the list there , Mr President .
I hope that the Prime Minister will contradict me later on .
You did not respond specifically to the question of the difference in figures between the cost of an initiative such as Voice of America , which costs USD 130 million , and that of another extremely effective radio station , Radio Free Asia , which is recognised as such by numerous inhabitants of Asia , and which only costs USD 30 million annually .
We could , of course , as some Members are proposing , allow the market to organise itself .
The European Commission has asked us to speak on this matter .
That is why it is time to establish a legislative act in accordance with our objective of building the internal market .
The problem is deciding on the principles according to which this should take place .
Asking questions about the future of retirement and care therefore equates to making social choices .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the work by the European Commission , the rapporteur , whom I thank , and our European Parliament , whose representatives have spoken this evening , are based on two central facts .
The report emphasises prevention .
What is the situation today ?
I remember Bonn just over a year ago .
In my opinion , based on the talks we had on the ground , that is not a certainty .
It is clearly a misfortune for any nation to be in a geostrategic or petrostrategic area like the Afghan people are , and this has obviously been the case for a long time .
Finally , I note that some directives are being revised for the seventh time , while others , like the 1979 ''Birds '' directive and the '' Habitats '' directive , which is ten years old now , have still not been revised at all .
What is needed is for the information for the consumer to be made more accurate and relevant .
Moreover , it is explicitly calling for the speedy adoption of the Commission 's lax proposals on allowing immigrants ' families to join them and the rights of long term resident immigrants , even going so far as to say that those rights must be 'as close as possible to those of European citizens ' .
We must respond quickly because we cannot close our eyes to the dramas currently being played out in our Member States .
If , in spite of everything , we voted in favour of this report , it is because the few recommendations that go in the right direction , that defend basic rights , that condemn racism and xenophobia or that oppose the death penalty , so much annoy the most reactionary parties in this Assembly .
This method has not been followed and this report , furthermore , reflects the opinion of the rapporteur rather than an in-depth analysis : the
