have tabled two amendments , which I hope will be supported by the majority in Parliament .     – Neighbourhood policy needs to be a more open concept , not restricted merely to Mediterranean issues or to the EU’s eastern border .
This is a blinkered view that does not take account of the reality of the situation .
As the report says , it is not enough simply to have a European Charter for Small Enterprises .
Accordingly , as the report says – and I take this opportunity to congratulate Mrs Vlasto on her work – it is crucial that the European institutions and the Member States implement and develop the actions laid down in the European Charter in full .
It is unacceptable that , in the 21st century , ten years after the Beijing Platform for Action , women still suffer every form of discrimination – be it at work , in the family , in politics or in society at large – and that the reconciliation of family and working life has yet to be achieved , even though family life is acknowledged to be the main factor holding women back in the labour market .
It is therefore crucial that women should not be penalised for motherhood .
Appropriate policies should be put in place to encourage people to share tasks in the home .
One of the EU’s key objectives should be equal representation in the political decision-making bodies .
One thing is for sure : if you have privileges you do not want to lose them ; if you are sitting comfortably in the seat of power you will not get up unless you are required to do so .
Alongside the Stability and Growth Pact , this is having a detrimental impact in the social field , affecting women in particular .
For this reason , it is impossible to go on claiming to be defending women’s rights while systematically undermining those rights , be it via the broad economic policy guidelines , or via policies and measures aimed at creating an internal market .
Representatives do have a ‘special status ’ which is conferred on them because they are seen as a ‘cross-section of the population’ .
While there have been a number of well-documented , unacceptable abuses , it is also true that some countries have developed certain practices and customs that actually enhance the prestige of their parliamentary assemblies and lend them their own particular character and flavour .
It is essential that specific , simplified measures and investment programmes be adopted , namely the creation and development of local funds of risk capital and ‘business angels ’ financing programmes , which will pave the way for increased investment in innovation by local and regional small businesses .     .
The involvement of SMEs is therefore a vital factor in implementing the objectives set in the Lisbon Strategy aimed at fostering sustainable growth and creating more and better jobs .
I refer to projects from which the SMEs benefit under the heading ‘Competitiveness , growth and employment’ , and more specifically the Seventh Framework Programme for development and the programme for competitiveness and innovation .     .
Despite these noble objectives , however , the reform proposed by the Commission would cause serious problems for Europe’s farmers , not least the swingeing reduction in the price of sugar .
This reform , however , would cause serious problems for Europe’s farmers , not least the swingeing reduction in the price of sugar .
I therefore voted in favour of the Fruteau reports .     .
A constitutional agreement , as the rapporteurs point out , is essential if the EU is to ( re)gain the confidence of European citizens , to maintain the dynamic of European integration and to play a credible role on the international stage .
Although we agree that the Treaty of Nice does not constitute a foundation for the future – and this is why we voted against – we object to attempts at following the path of deeper neoliberalism , federalism and militarism .
It is no coincidence that UNICE , the European employers ’ association , said in a letter to the Austrian Presidency : ‘there is an urgent need to find a way out of the current institutional crisis in the EU’.
I also recognise that it is strategically important for political institutions to encourage a pro-active attitude on the part of the media ( in particular television , the press and local radio ) and to enlist them for the purpose of publicising and intensifying the debate .
On the other hand , the idea behind what some have been saying , namely that there is only one possible outcome , whatever that may be , is one that I would neither accept nor support .
This recognition arises from the excellent geo-strategic positions adopted by these partners and the fundamental reforms that many of them have undertaken , not to mention the long-standing cultural and historical affinity with mainland Europe and with the outermost regions , including those in the Atlantic , owing to their geographical proximity .     .
The EU has everything in place to be an important player on the international stage ; not in the way that some would wish , but certainly an important body in international relations .
Cape Verde is a perfect example of democracy , good governance and respect for human rights and has deep-rooted historical , political , cultural and geographical ties with the EU.
Cape Verde could also represent a vital counterweight in the policy , which would be all the poorer were it narrowly centred on the Union’s southern and eastern borders .
I therefore voted in favour of the Estrela report .     .
The diagnosis has long been known
