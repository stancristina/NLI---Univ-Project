As far as I know , there is no adequate test to make sure that they are BSE-free .
So I welcome the ban .
With regard to the removal of the vertebral column , you have brought up the question : where should it take place , abattoir or at the point of sale ?
But is it really necessary ?
We must take into account the Scientific Steering Committee ' s review , but surely if the spinal cord is removed adequately that should be enough .
Whatever happens , all these safeguards must be monitored carefully .
I am pleased that there is going to be a monthly report from other EU countries as happens in the UK at the moment , but please bring in these measures quickly .
Make sure they are properly in force and please learn from the UK' s past mistakes .
Commissioner Byrne , I am not noted usually for complimenting you on your good performance but on this occasion I wish to be fair .
It is totally wrong for Member States now to blame the Commission when you were pointing out as long as a couple of years ago the problems that were going to occur .
What Member States have done by trying to make out which beef is the safest in Europe , is to destroy European beef .
There is no doubt about that .
We need to take action now across Europe .
I am a farmer who farmed through the BSE crisis in the UK.
I saw the value of my cattle drop to virtually nothing .
It is very painful for the farming industry to see this happen and it is happening now throughout the whole of Europe , so action needs to be taken .
I do not think we want to re-invent the wheel so we should look to the measures that have been taken in Britain and have restored consumer confidence .
I would urge , and I know Commissioner Byrne agrees with this , to have one policy throughout Europe .
If we do not , the European press will take each Member State in turn , they will look at the safety measures that are in those states and they will compare and then people ' s confidence in beef in general will collapse .
There is no doubt that the older cattle , however painful it is , have to be taken out of the food chain .
They must be destroyed .
Not only is there incineration but there is now a sodium hydrolysis method of dissolving cattle .
I am sure you are looking at that , because that could be a better and possibly a cheaper method of disposing of these cattle .
We need also to look at imports of cattle from outside the European Union , because not only do we need to get our act together , I believe there is a lot of complacency about this in the rest of the world .
At the end of the day , we must get beef consumption up , we must convince the consumer that it is safe and let them eat European beef .

Mr President , I was the shadow rapporteur for the PSE on this .
What Mr Miranda says is correct , but it is misleading to say that is an amendment .
As the notes in front of you say there was a mistake by the services and in fact the wording that was put in by both the PPE and ourselves was not reflected in what was printed .
Therefore Mr Miranda ' s interpretation of what we should vote on is absolutely correct and I totally support him , but this is not a question of a further amendment .
There was a genuine , technical error by the services .
For absolute clarity , I have the wording here from the original .
Missed off at the beginning of the amendment were the words " whereas Plan Colombia is not the process of dialogue amongst the various social partners and .. . " and then the rest remains .
Mr President , I wondered why Mr Fatuzzo has nothing to say on this .
I would have thought that he would have had a minute to share with us .
We are being deprived because we have no explanation of how he voted on the Plan Colombia .
I wonder through you , President , if it is possible to ask him if he could explain to assembled masses here how he voted , because it is important that we know .

The UK Labour Members of the PES support the spirit of this Resolution , but have reservations regarding some of its content .
We do not support the inclusion of the European Public Prosecutor in this text ( paragraph five ) .
The Resolution seeks to give such a body power over Member States ' territories , which is an inappropriate response to the cooperation between nations the Report called for .
The legitimacy of such a body to override national judicial rulings would be questionable , and the judicial discretion of Member States ' legal authorities should be preserved .
In addition , some parts of the text are potentially ambiguous with areas of legal confusion e.g . paragraph nine on indirect sanctions to be applied to Member States ( paragraph nine ) and the call to extend the powers of the European Court of Justice in its rulings over instruments decided outside the sphere of the EU.
Finally , the UK Labour Members support cooperation in criminal matters , but have reservations concerning the reference to the 'harmonisation of criminal laws ' in paragraph thirteen , which suggests that Member States should standardise criminal law throughout the EU.
Whilst this may be desirable in some areas , cooperation in criminal matters should focus
