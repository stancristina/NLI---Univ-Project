rights to be pursued with a view to achieving full employment , which is still far from being a reality .
The report also demands that the United States of America and Somalia be called on to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child .
It is equally important that we insist on increasing the financial and human resources to support the actions that have been planned , given that , in 2001 , only EUR 2.02 million were earmarked for integrating the promotion of gender equality into development cooperation , as compared with EUR 5 million allocated in 1998 .
Worse still , these countries have not been penalised in any way for failing to meet their targets .
.
Portugal , as everyone knows , has already exceeded the planned reduction by more than 40 % , which is also regrettable , since there are countries that have not only failed to achieve reductions but have even increased their fishing capacity .
Europe is still the most popular tourist region in the world and the potential of this sector , especially following the planned enlargement of the European Union , is immense .
Employment will grow at a rate of around 15 % in the next ten years .
Other factors boosting the tourist sector , such as the liberalisation of transport and the development of transport networks , the progress of the single market , particularly the reality of the single currency , and the considerable developments and outcomes of the Information Society will continue to promote mobility and the internationalisation of tourist flows .
I say this because one of the fundamental problems is that so many sectors have an impact on tourism that , unless we look at them as a whole , much of the impact , the importance and the coherence of these proposals will be lost .
We must , therefore , support work on economic diversification by making use of the opportunities provided in Article 299( 2 ) .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , of course our group broadly supports the Sixth Framework Programme and the objective that is being formalised here of more financial resources for European research policy .
To this extent , we feel that European research funds must only be used for those objectives and in accordance with those methods and means that are not deemed to be illegal in any Member State .
The Treaty of Amsterdam introduced the concept of openness and transparency into the Treaties , in such a way as to give any citizen of the Union , and any natural or legal person residing or having its registered office in a Member State , a right of access to Parliament , Council and Commission documents .
( PT ) At first reading , the Council regrettably chose not to accept some of the proposals that we had tabled and that Parliament had adopted which sought to achieve better protection for employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer , amending the 1980 directive to enable it to cope with the frequent cases of insolvency in the European Union .
We therefore support the initiative of organising a European Year of Education through Sport in 2004 - a year in which the European football championships will take place and in which the Olympic and Paralympic Games will be held in Athens .
The proposal that has now been put forward for TEMPUS III , to incorporate the aim of 'promoting understanding between and rapprochement of cultures and developing free and flourishing civil societies' , exactly along the lines laid down in the Barcelona Declaration of 1995 , which established the Euro-Mediterranean partnership , is of great importance .
It is also well known that the issue of tourism has already been addressed on several occasions at ministerial summits and in European Council conclusions , and its importance as a driving force for the economic growth of the Union , particularly in the least-developed regions , underlined .
In fact , the bad experience of so many other sectors in which handing over competence to Europe has led to excessive uniform regulation , continual interference in the field of national and even regional decision making and to constant breaches of the principle of subsidiarity cautions us to be prudent in this area .
Furthermore , the White Paper twists the opinions of young people to say the opposite of what was meant .
Lastly , we also regret the absence in the appropriate chapter of the White Paper of an explicit reference to the numerous Community programmes - from the Structural Funds to programmes such as Urban , Equal or even Meda - which have for a long time been pivotal instruments of Community policies and in which we must increasingly promote a sufficient number of projects that will benefit young people .
My third question is , where does growth feature in the Stability Pact ?
- ( PT ) Unfortunately , the amendments I proposed to this report on potato starch were rejected by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
- ( PT ) After all the many months of work and wide-ranging interinstitutional discussions , both in public and within the Parliament , I regard it as being very regrettable indeed that the majority of this House has still insisted on rejecting all the amendments inspired by basic ethical imperatives of a humanitarian nature .
There are in fact seven different directives establishing specific hygiene standards for intra-Community trade in products of animal origin and imports from third countries , with a view to preventing the spread of epizootic diseases through food sales , a field in which , as we know , the overall European system is not at all transparent and has led to highly unacceptable instances of discrimination
