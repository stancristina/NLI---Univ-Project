, better sharing of information on available resources , expertise and successful strategies at national level .
Three , better communication , coordination , in-time information systems for the prompt information of the public and links with other networks .
Six , empowerment of research and development of emergency systems for a more efficient management of disasters .
Over recent years , all of us in the European Union and the world at large have experienced disasters with the broadest , direct consequences on the lives of a large number of our fellow men and on society and the economy as a whole .
This relates both to the monitoring mechanism and to the Solidarity Fund .
It not only resolves daily problems , but is also of major symbolic importance .
To the outside world , this sort of programme gives the European Union visibility and , more importantly , projects an efficient and humane face , something which , listening to you on the previous report Commissioner , you intend to make a reality .     .
I have no doubt that the European Community has a very important role to play in improving conditions under which animals can be fed , transported and slaughtered .     . – We would like to observe that financing of actions for natural and man-made disasters is so limited that , essentially , it cancels out any possibility of material intervention and efficiency .
When no money is available for anti-flood works , when anti-earthquake standards are not met , when forests are left at the mercy of arsonists and land cannibals , when shipowners remain unaccountable and unpunished after huge ecological disasters , what protection can we talk of ?
It is precisely because the people of Zimbabwe managed , through huge , bloody battles , to gain their independence from Britain and because they are claiming their land , the richest part of which still belongs to foreigners – mainly Britons – as a result of colonialism , that a new plan of intervention is being prepared , the aim of which is to turn Zimbabwe into a modern colony .
The sanctions must stop .
This is where the role of the European Union within the framework of the UN and within the framework of other international organisations may be more efficient .
The motion records the problems which still exist and numerous honourable members spoke about them in the area of Bhopal as a whole .
To close , I consider that the best way for us to express our sympathy with the victims and their families is for the European Commission to take initiatives in cooperation with the World Health Organisation on the implementation of medical and environmental restitution programmes .     – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , if you gave the Constitution , or whatever you ultimately call it , to a cartoonist in any country of Europe who respects the principles of democracy , of national sovereignty , of the values of the historic and cultural heritage , he would draw it like a mincer from which various parts of various animals , from sheep to cows , come out in the form of minced meat .
We say yes to the right of opinion and rejection , yes to the Europe of sovereign nations , yes to Christianity and human rights , yes to the pride and dignity of the peoples .
We have time to reverse globalisation and the new order of things .
I fully endorse everything that has been said and I congratulate them on the excellent report which they have submitted .
The European Union is going down in global history as a union of states which aims to serve values .
The adoption of the Constitution for Europe is a huge step forward .
That is why , irrespective of the reservations and the individual objections which we have , we all need to act and work for the approval of this Constitution , for its ratification by all the Member States     – Mr President , the major risks from this Constitution are three in number .
In my opinion , this Constitution answers all these questions most positively , in all events much more positively than they are addressed under current treaties .
We need to ensure that the seeds of social awareness sown in the Constitution do not remain pretty words and are put into practice .
As , therefore , almost all the issues have been exhausted , I shall confine myself to one vital problem .
Nonetheless , the declarations relating to the provisions of the Constitution state that , if two years after signature of the Constitution , 4/5 of the Member States have ratified the Constitution in question and one or more Member States are facing difficulties in connection with ratification , the matter will be submitted to the European Council .
Therefore , it is not enough for us to talk and to support the ratification of the Constitution unreservedly .
Commissioner , a few weeks ago you were a minister in the Italian Government .
Why can you not pick up the telephone and ask both the Italian and the Greek Government what happened ?     – Madam President , Commissioner , I think there has been another mistake here or something has escaped you .
I wonder , therefore , how is it that you too have not yet found out about it , so that you can make the relevant observations today .     . – Mr President , we have to deal with three issues in the wake of this disaster : First , how this solidarity can be better expressed ; in other words , how much money from European citizens will reach citizens in this devastated area , without being siphoned off by middlemen , para-governmental organisations and contractors .
