, the G8+5 , the World Trade Organization , the International Monetary Fund and also the OECD , in which it is the only Latin American member .
I believe that we are providing a substantial impetus through this strategic partnership with Mexico and , above all , we are sending out a clear , well-defined message about Europe 's commitment to Latin America .
We share basic concerns in the area of environmental protection and , on this basis , we should begin a dialogue on issues such as climate change , water management , biodiversity and deforestation , as well as on the role that indigenous peoples should play in all these things .
I said as much myself with regard to Mexico in April last year during a debate here in Parliament on the Lima summit .
In the case of Brazil , the intensification of relations should also help to unblock the EU-Mercosur Agreement .
For its part , on 13 October 2008 the European General Affairs and External Relations Council recognised Mexico as a strategic partner , pending Parliament 's opinion on the matter .
In Europe the current crisis is above all affecting the sectors more oriented towards exports , while in Mexico it is very specifically affecting those actors that suffer most from the consequences of the economic slowdown .
I am not saying that that is necessarily a bad thing , but I am saying that we must be careful and remain very aware that it may have highly negative consequences .
Another important point is cooperation to achieve the Millennium Development Goals , as well as social cohesion in relation to the important leadership shown by Brazil in its policy to reduce poverty through the ' Bolsa Família ' or 'family fund ' .
Another very important point that we do not like is that the report calls for joint participation in nuclear research projects , especially the ITER thermonuclear reactor project .
It is true that there has been progress if we look at aspects where the country has a poor human rights record , in relation to the murder of women .
Naturally , it is a political decision based on certain criteria .
We hold meetings at senior official level and also at ministerial level , for example , at which we see what can be done to help these countries and where we also exchange experience .
Of course , we are going to have another ministerial meeting in Prague in May , and again we are going to try and force a possible conclusion , but I think we are still going to find ourselves facing this challenge .
Madam President , to conclude this debate I should simply like to say that the decision to grant Mexico and Brazil the status of strategic partners is the right decision and one that will mean a qualitative leap in our relations , due to the political , economic , strategic and demographic importance of those countries .
Latin America and our partners need opportunities from us , rather than handouts , and such opportunities are represented today by association agreements .
I have known few people more clearly willing to talk and reach an agreement than the Tibetan people .
The memorandum for genuine autonomy for the Tibetan people , now rejected by China as a working document , shows that the Tibetan people have already made a genuine effort and given up an enormous amount of what , I emphasise , are their legitimate aspirations .
China now has the opportunity to show the world its generosity and its desire for peace and harmony and , above all , the European Union has the opportunity to help it act in accordance with its greatness .
EU-Brazil Strategic Partnership ( 17 .
With regard to improving mobility , I would like to point out that , to facilitate exchanges with men and women scientists from third countries , including those with which there is already substantial scientific cooperation , as may be the case with certain Latin American countries , it is crucial to introduce a special , faster and less bureaucratic visa policy .
I think it is clear that the situation not just of the 300 000 displaced people but also , basically , of the now countless victims of disappearances , torture and even serial murders needs first to be investigated and then to receive a political response from the government , at the insistence of the international community .
Ideally , of course , President Bashir should be forced to resign and be handed directly to the International Criminal Court .
One is on recital B and the other is on paragraph 4 .
I say commotion with all due respect for the contributions from civil society , NGOs and the national parliaments that are also involved .
Apart from anything else , we must consider that the system we are going to replace , first the Lomé Convention and then the arrangement based on the Cotonou Agreements , in no way achieved the desired results .
Another thing to consider is , of course , how these negotiations and the specific topics that are on the table have been handled .
The motion for a resolution , which we will vote on tomorrow , is based on the idea that artistic education forms the basis for vocational training in the field of the arts and promotes creativity , as well as physical and intellectual development in that sphere ; it considers artistic education to be an essential component of learning in childhood and adolescence and argues that teaching it in schools will lay the foundations for truly democratising access to culture .
For all these reasons , I would ask for majority support for the report , which will send out a clear message of support to professionals , students and businesses in the creative and cultural sector .
