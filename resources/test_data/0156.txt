As far as authorisation and substitution are concerned , I see with satisfaction that the Members of Parliament have proposed a large number of valuable amendments which set time limits on authorisation and increase the pressure for substitution , thus strengthening protection of human health and the environment .
To close , I should like once again to thank all the members of the European Parliament who have worked so intensively over the past nine months in order to make progress on the REACH proposal .
In this way , the European Parliament is making a decisive contribution to improving the level of protection of health and the environment in Europe , while at the same time maintaining the competitiveness of European industry .     – Mr President , the history of REACH is a history of constant weakening of the Commission 's initial proposal and every time the Commission comes along and celebrates a different proposal from the initial proposal it submitted .
With this negative agreement , not only is the protection of public health and the environment not being put first ; on the contrary , it is being subjugated to the demands of a poor perception of competitiveness .
I refer to the questions of environmental protection and public health and to the need to adapt to the new circumstances being created with the introduction not only of quantitative but also of qualitative criteria , such as the dangers inherent in chemical compounds .
Innovation , by which I mean the composition of new compounds which are friendly to the environment and to health , is the key to achieving the harmonious updating of the three pillars of sustainable development .
I thank the Commissioners and the Greek Commissioner for their support on this major issue .     Mr President , I shall be very brief .
There are of course certain other issues , such as the issue of authorisation and substitution , which are the concern of the European Chemicals Agency , issues on which I am certain that Parliament will decide with the same transparency .
Thank you very much for your attention and for taking part in such an important debate .     – Mr President , within the European framework , there is a large number of decentralised or quasi-independent operational bodies which are identified under the title 'regulatory agencies ' .
The excessive increase in the number of regulatory agencies will result , without doubt , in an increase in European regulatory intervention , in the separation and lack of transparency of European policies and , by extension , in difficulties with operational coordination .
Firstly , it is very important to support the European prospects of Kosovo , as the UN ambassador , Mr Eide , says in several paragraphs of his report .
First , we gave real support to the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union .
Thirdly , Albania is being largely maintained economically by the currency imported by its citizens working in Greece .
In return , Mr Swoboda , we are on the receiving end of intransigence on the question of the name , propaganda which disregards history and historical and cultural aggression .
However , it is the right of the European Union , of all its political and institutional agencies and of its Member States to control the course of their integration .
At the same time , we cannot guarantee future integration if there is no sign of constant progress in the application of reforms .
This applies to Turkey .
The practice towards human and minority rights ?
Support for the European prospects of the Western Balkans , with the objective of their future integration into the European institutions , constitutes an investment in security for the European Union itself .
Serbia has a decisive role to play in the stability of the Balkans .
As far as the outstanding issue of the name is concerned , I would like to say that it takes two to tango and , unfortunately , the leadership in Skopje is encaged in an impasse from the past .     – Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , following your very interesting statements , I should like to make the following comments : The first comment concerns the Commissioner 's last sentence .
An important event which , however , still leaves certain very important problems outstanding , such as the issue and the role of religion , the federal model , the national identity and access to natural resources , especially oil .
It is the matter of security .
It is indeed , if you look no further than the degree of participation and the arithmetic aspects of the results .
The majority of Sunnis are consciously outside political processes .
Under these conditions elections are being planned to promote the new Iraqi parliament .
Madam President , I am particularly pleased to be given the opportunity to debate with you the recent developments surrounding climate change and the way in which the relevant policy of the European Union will be strengthened and the active involvement of all partners in productive international cooperation in this field will be achieved .
Although specific weather phenomena cannot be connected directly to climate change , the increase in the phenomena of droughts and floods and the more serious and more frequent hurricanes or tropical storms nonetheless confirm scientific warnings about climate change .
As we all know , when the planet heats up , the sea also heats up and when the temperature of the sea exceeds 26°C , then a tropical cyclone is likely to develop .
The motion for a resolution emphasises that the Community strategy for restricting climate change must be based on an approach which includes the following : building on key elements of the Kyoto Protocol , strong
