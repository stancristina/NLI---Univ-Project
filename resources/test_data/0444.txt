minimising drug misuse and ensure that there is fast and effective treatment to help individuals in their need to put drug misuse behind them .
The EU institutions can provide information about which decisions are made , and how , but it is the right of the independent mass media to make judgments themselves concerning current affairs and to decide what they are to provide information about .
We Moderates are therefore voting against the above-mentioned report .
We cannot therefore support a common military defence , increased defence costs financed from the Community budget or a collective defence clause .
Like previous speakers , we wish to emphasise respect for human rights , especially freedom of information , expression and association .
These are fundamental values included in the association agreement between the EU and Egypt .
People must , moreover , be able freely to express their opinions and values in demonstrations .
Different regulations apply to restoring and constructing churches as distinct from mosques .
Other examples are the murders of two Christians in 1998 in the El-Kosheh community - crimes which the local Christian population does not consider to have been solved equitably .
( SV ) I abstained from voting in the final vote on the report , which was adopted by 275 votes in favour and 96 against , with 11 abstentions .
Certain Member States would then be able to form a military alliance within the EU.
The report seeks to bind the EU 's defence industry and military organisations more closely together .
At the same time , we must also be consistent and not allow unduly major exemptions in connection , for example , with genetically modified organisms , nuclear power and marine transport .
It is also very important for Article 175 to form the legal basis so that , as the previous speaker too pointed out , the existing systems are not undermined .
The matter should be vigorously pursued by the EU within the WTO .
The European Union 's shipbuilding industry is in a serious situation , since the manufacture of certain vessels has been struck a serious blow due to disloyal competition from South Korea .
Sweden abolished these forms of aid some years ago .
We therefore have our doubts about reintroducing them .
The EU 's restoring or prolonging state aid to certain vessels would not help .
The first of these was the preparations for the forthcoming enlargement , which was less certain then than it is now .
A year ago , we gave Parliament and other institutions the ability to engage in the long-term financial management of these matters , especially by means of the frontloading carried out during the autumn of last year .
This was subsequently followed up by decisions here in Parliament on 9 April , the signing of the accession treaties in Athens a week later and a number of successful referendums , most recently in Lithuania , something that imposes extraordinarily large demands , especially upon Europe 's elected parliaments .
That the EU and the European Parliament must put these things into effect is , of course , self-evident to all of us who see the reunification of Europe as the most important task of all .
We sometimes see a tendency on the part of rapporteurs , as well as on the part of other MEPs , also to want to smuggle in other aspects .
The Statute concerns how the mechanisms that are to guarantee employees ' right of codecision in European Cooperative Societies are to operate in practice .
Thirdly , the rights that employees enjoyed before the European Cooperative Society was created must be guaranteed .
It is a question of bringing about an approximation between the Member States ' legislation , not of transferring the right of decision from national legislation to the EU.
We believe that , as far as possible , the procedure for developing a European Cooperative Society must be characterised by scrutiny and transparency .
Because the proposal for a regulation concerns the various stages in the life cycle of a European Cooperative Society , such as its establishment , the transfer of headquarters and liquidation , a number of different amendments are required if it is to be possible to apply these principles to the different situations described in the proposal for a regulation .
Our report also calls for the removal of the general clause according to which the Member States may be exempted from the provisions concerning employee involvement when a European Cooperative Society is established as a result of a merger between two cooperatives .
The European Parliament addressed the issue at a first reading in 1993 .
Cooperatives are a form of company that should be given every support , especially in political quarters , because they represent participatory democracy in action .
Because there are so many tasks for the social economy in the new Europe , we need this Statute .
There is of course a saying that goes , Navigare necesse est , vivere non est necesse .
Today , we can see that the agreement concerning this directive has stopped the European market from fragmenting .
I am grateful for his having mentioned my own country .
When , before the end of 2006 , the Commission goes on to review the directive , it is important for the issue of noise from water scooters to be examined in detail , because water scooters at present constitute the greatest nuisance in terms of noise in many areas of the vulnerable Scandinavian archipelago .
This matter too would now appear , however , to have been dealt with .
I hope that a new approach can be adopted when reviewing the directive , for we are concerned here with thoroughly detailed regulation that should perhaps take a different turn in the future
