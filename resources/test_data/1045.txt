Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Tappin for a splendid report that looks carefully at the status of SMEs and public services .
Both sectors are vital for our societies but , nonetheless , they suffer from unfair treatment .
Establishing internal markets thus means having to free up services for the public good , which in turn means great changes in social structure .
The European Economic Interest Grouping the rapporteur refers to may bring a precious element of added value to the status of SMEs , which by and large are not yet aware of the opportunities available in the single market .
Now , with Cardiff , a step has been taken in the same direction .
The participation of SMEs in public procurement is vital .
They employ most of the workers .
Reduced income tax is the goal and that is of particular concern to labour-intensive service sectors .
In Europe this is particularly required for innovative SMEs , which will then grow into larger companies and , as was stated in the meeting on SMEs and employment held by the Group of the Party of European Socialists , on that hangs the future of employment in Europe .
Although I do not agree with the rapporteur on all the details contained in it , I consider it important that its central concern is to aim for proportional representation in all Member States of the Union .
As the aim is , as the rapporteur stresses , that Members of Parliament and citizens assume closer ties , I cannot agree with the rapporteur 's assessment , for example , of the need for a single European list of candidates for election .
Communications between Parliament and the voters are already very often pretty tenuous .
Greater community and representation of the people will not come about through common election lists and dates .
As for the latter , the main question concerning election dates is the assurance of sufficiently long-term advance voting for all EU citizens .
Simultaneous membership of a national parliament and the European Parliament calls into question the whole credibility of both the Member of Parliament and the institutions .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the rapporteur 's task has been a difficult one .
It is good that the Treaty of Amsterdam creates a framework for the harmonization of elections in all Member States .
Regional representation guarantees democracy in national and international policy .
And this is despite the fact that there they have one common language throughout the entire country .
In the EU there is not nor will there ever be one single language nor one single television network broadcasting identical TV programmes to one and all .
It is diversity that is the very hallmark of Europeanness .
Sameness is not a strength in the information society .
Finnish affairs and representatives on the other hand could in no way become well known in Britain .
This is the sort of " silly ' federalism that destroys harmony .
Mr President , EU federalists aim to increase transnational decision-making .
To insist on such a thing would be a travesty of democracy .
There is only national democracy .
Europe is not a nation .
Insistence on one vast European electoral constituency is at odds with the whole idea of decision-making becoming decentralized .
These lists will furnish Parliament with only "yes ' Members , "ja' and "jawohl ' Members , "oui' Members , " sí ' Members , but no Members from small countries .
At the end of the 1980s and the start of the 1990s , as a result of some occurrences of hacking , the Commission 's computer system architecture was modified so that internal information systems were centred on what are called closed user groups .
Communications within and outside the building are monitored by the present telecommunications centre in the information technology directorate in accordance with the parameters that exist for security arrangements and technical facilities .
The experience the young people got from taking part in the project has been beyond comparison .
As for this question of sports regulations , I am going to report this discussion to my colleague responsible for sports policy .
I know my colleague will investigate the matter thoroughly .
One is voluntary work and the other is sports policy .
In addition , the Agenda 2000 proposal for the period 2000 to 2006 is so structured that expenditure will not rise to the 1.27 % level , but that the fifteen EU Member State level should even see a downward trend , expenditure reaching 1.13 % by the year 2006 .
Madam President , I wish to thank the rapporteur Mrs Dybkjær very warmly for her success in explaining so clearly that the three most recent Member States should not be penalized because the European Union has not been able to keep to its agreement .
At the same time it would have also enabled EU environmental standards to rise .
Agenda 2000 is an important tool , but it is worth bearing in mind that when we quite justifiably insisted , in the context of enlargement , that future Member States must observe the European Union 's strict rules , at least strict in the opinion of the newcomers , we also have to see to it that the EU for its own part honours its agreements and commitments .
For example , there is a dearth of statistical information , and , given this , I believe the report , in the shape it is in now , will act as a sort of catalogue of those issues that ought to be systematized and considered later on .
I think it is highly regrettable that there should be a desire merely to attribute all this to the wishes of the rapporteur .
This number has now been whittled down to 34.The matter is clearly
