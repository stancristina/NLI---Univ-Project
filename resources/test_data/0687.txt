I am also a little sceptical about what Mr Souchet said regarding the national level .
We have really good experience of that in the Baltic .
As regards over-bureaucratisation , which was mentioned earlier , we must aim for self-management and taking influence on our own situation .
When people have responsibility , they can help in bringing their own situation under control , and that works against bureaucracy .
In this connection I must not forget to thank Allan , with whom I worked in the North Sea Commission , precisely on these matters .
When there are two such trawlers in the Baltic , it hardly matters whether or not we have self-management and regionalisation .
Regionalisation therefore means self-management , responsibility and active participation .
I think it is important , as many of my colleagues have pointed out this evening , that we do not divide up the alcohol market in such a way that we have one thing in one corner and another somewhere else .
That is the first point .
The second point is that the rules should come into force simultaneously , in order to avoid a situation in which different rules apply depending on whether one drinks beer , wine or spirits .
And the third point is that , in order to ensure uniform rules , it is necessary that the same decision-making procedure should be used , that the same rules should be applied , with the full involvement of the European Parliament .
I also support Amendment No 23 , which requires it to be indicated on the bottle how much alcohol or how many ingredients it contains , so that we car-drivers and others know how much we can drink from a health point of view .
I very much hope that we can adopt this report tomorrow .
In both cases , we are talking about liquids which are consumed at social gatherings or with a meal .
But it does not tackle the key issue , namely those cases in which total EU harmonisation will come into conflict with the Member States ' wishes to have better rules than those adopted in the Community .
We always support those in the June Movement .
However , the problems arise when rules are adopted instead under provisions relating to the internal market , because then a majority decision taken in a secret committee or a closed Council of Ministers meeting can put the Folketing in the dunce 's corner and abolish a law , even when it has been adopted unanimously in the Folketing .
Take the cancer list , for example .
For creosote , Denmark has invoked the environmental guarantee and banned the substance because it can cause cancer , but in the EU it is now forbidden to forbid the substance , and the Commission has not yet approved the Danish use of the environmental guarantee .
Free movement for carcinogens takes precedence over public health !
I thought that we would be hearing something constructive and positive .
This report is a good and important initiative .
The EU must be a lever for better safety and health in the Community 's workplaces .
Industrial injuries and accidents cost billions of euros every year , but more than anything they represent personal tragedies and costs .
Often it is too late when the damage has occurred .
It is not just a good investment from the economic point of view ; it is an investment whose results cannot be assessed in terms of money .
It is time that asbestos was completely banned .
The after-effects are something people have to live with for the rest of their lives , and often they develop cancer - a disease which we all know can be fatal and painful .
Finally , let me stress how important it is that the EU should be constantly at the cutting edge of developments .
We must take an active stance and put pressure on the Member States to act before the damage occurs .
For example , many people who work in offices contract repetitive strain injury , because they use a computer all day long .
Also , the psychological working environment is a problem which for too long has not been taken seriously .
In addition , we must of course campaign to bring about a reduction in limit values which apply to dangerous substances .
You would have to look a long way to find more traditional gender role patterns than those found in the Commission .
Women make up 80 % of the people who carry out secretarial and office work , while men occupy 87 % of the managerial positions .
I would therefore like to ask the Commission , and especially Mrs Gradin , whether it would not be a good idea to introduce positive discrimination for women in managerial posts within the Commission ?
There should always be individual assessment of individual candidates .
Positive discrimination should not be a permanent solution , but as the situation stands in the Commission at the moment , it is necessary to resort to drastic measures .
Madam President , at present the Commissioners are appointed by each individual Member State .
So ultimately our voters are the ones who have the final say and indirectly appoint the Danish Member of the Commission .
But now Parliament is saying instead that it should elect or reject the Commission .
The Commission is to be elected by Parliament in almost the same way as a national parliament elects a government .
Parliament expects to be able to reject the names which are put forward by the Member States when they are not in line with the views of the majority .
That is contrary to the Amsterdam Treaty and therefore illegal .
