and the recognition of habeas corpus ; I believe that these freedoms are the same as those enjoyed by Westerners and that we should not seek to draw a distinction between them .
Mr President , I have been so bold as to intervene without taking notes because I really do not think that we can continue to treat these people with such great inhumanity .
This is why the Joint Parliamentary Assembly should send a mission to Togo to report on respect for human rights and the smooth running of the electoral process .
We should also recognise , however , not only that Articles 10 and 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights should apply to them , of course , but also that it is real-life democracy that is at stake here , and that in one case we are dealing with Turkey , a candidate country for accession to the European Union .
There are languages which are not spoken by many people but which are nevertheless national languages , such as Luxemburgish .
But today , in the name of this very political group , I would like to thank you for your Presidency ...
I am , however , speaking completely from the heart when I say that both my group and myself truly appreciate and have a great deal of respect for your Presidency .
Your Presidency has been characterised by elegance , by the dignity that you have managed to maintain at all times , on your personal behalf and for this Parliament that you represent .
They went about their job the right way : a discreet presence , no provocation , broad tolerance which is expected in an open , democratic society , and swift , firm intervention as soon as a certain threshold was exceeded .
Just a few years ago , it would undoubtedly have been impossible to speak of directly electing the President of the European Commission or of a European constitution , for example .
I am sure that they will put all the energy of their European convictions into working on producing an ambitious final report that will be able to issue recommendations if there is a consensus .
These are all key elements of the action plan against terrorism that we set up following the attacks on 11 September .
I have submitted a compromise proposal in anticipation of the forthcoming Internal Market Council on 20 December .
At Laeken , we also discussed the Union ' s enlargement .
I drew up what I myself thought was a balanced proposal .
The Belgian Presidency has always enjoyed the full support of the European Parliament and I am grateful to you all for that .
If you are abroad a lot and hold discussions with alternative globalists , it suddenly dawns on you that the European Union has for years had a home-grown solution , a recipe for prosperity that has been successively applied to Greece , Spain , Ireland and Portugal .
Are we then - and this is a question I would like to ask in conclusion of my mediation and in closing the Presidency , although there remain a few things to be done in the next few days - are we then as Europe , not better placed to forge the kind of new order craved by the world ?
All these positive assessments are justified by the fact that a new dynamic has now been set in motion .
It is a matter of regret to me that the Council ' s final text does not send a message to the United States .
As for world poverty , you said yourself , Mr President , that the gap between the north and south has not diminished and instead has become even wider .
If we genuinely wish , as the Declaration by the Fifteen stated , to use citizens ' expectations as the main theme of our imminent reflections , then , in my view , the debate cannot fail to include the institutional questions of the European project , the political guidelines that the institutions are supposed to implement .
As if Europe ' s ability to wage war was a guarantee of its international authority .
And we have already forgotten this , since , at the last session , we adopted an association agreement with Egypt , without batting an eyelid , disregarding the warnings and requests for additional information on a number of serious human rights violations , which have also been voiced today .
I wholeheartedly support the aim of the Declaration to " set globalisation into a moral framework " .
Thirdly , we must make progress on better regulation .
We must adopt the opposite approach ; in other words , bring Europe closer to the people .
The same goes for the representation of the candidate countries .
The challenge represented by the Laeken declaration , and which must be taken up by the Convention , is precisely to tip the balance in favour of strengthening democracy , efficiency and cohesion on a European level .
However , the future will tell whether the seed sown at Laeken will bear fruit .
I apologise to all the Members , especially those MEPs with whom I have had very intense contacts over recent weeks and months : Mr Brok , Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo , the chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , Mr Napolitano .
If agreement was not reached at that stage , fresh leftovers would be created .
All is not lost yet , since only three of the twelve places have been allocated .
Quite the opposite .
We are happy to see that the praesidium , which will play a determining role , will be reasonably large , twelve people , which is what we wanted , and it will be led by three strong political personalities whose commitment to Europe is beyond question .
