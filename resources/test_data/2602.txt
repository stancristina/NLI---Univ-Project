Mr President , Mr Purvis , I have to be quite honest with you , and tell you that I have not been informed about the results of this research ; perhaps because it was conducted primarily for health reasons , and therefore falls within the remit of the Commissioner responsible for health .
We are deluding ourselves if we think we can control the problem from the supply side .
In Parliament ' s view , the result we now have before us is a great success of a kind which would still have been unthinkable two years ago .
Any more kow-towing to industrial agriculture would lead in the longer term to our most important drinking water resources being destroyed once and for all .
Let us remember , however , that until the very end a number of Member States vehemently resisted any requirement that they should manage their own water resources more carefully and in an environmentally more conscious way in future .
Cars of this kind , made out of plastic or fibreglass or whatever , do not , however , have the advantage of being able to be recycled .
Cost allocation is therefore not as simple as all that .
The second important point for me is no longer the issue of costs and competition .
Mr President , where air traffic too is concerned , the Group of the European People ' s Party and European Democrats supports the initiative of the European Commission and of the responsible Vice-President , Mrs Palacio , to reconcile causing as little damage as possible to the environment with citizens ' and companies ' interest in being able to travel .
I am no lawyer and am not in a position to judge .
I just want to straighten that out because Mrs Roth-Behrendt ' s name was mentioned .
Health insurances , pensions systems and the Treasury together lose billions every year .
They also call for surveillance and for sanctions to be imposed when undeclared work is detected .
In this way , I now come to a core demand of this really excellent report by Mrs Glase .
This would-be panacea does not in fact work .
People who engage in undeclared work are to be found not only among the unemployed and among those who have entered the country illegally and have to suffer at the hands of those who profiteer from unemployment .
Mr President , on a point of order .
I hope that FIFA recognises that and will now finally come up with something that the Commission can include in its proposals , as long as they do not run counter to the Bosman judgment .
It is all too easy to be complacent and attribute a very important social and unifying role to sport , where fair play is held up as a model for our interaction with each other , be it at work , in politics or whatever .
The Council Presidency has said that sport is education for life .
In contrast , in Germany the break-even principle is already being implemented , as is monitoring of unfair practices by the cartel office and by local authorities .
I would like to stress once again that we have always said that this is about 'therapeutic cloning ' .
However , bearing in mind the forecast doubling of air traffic by 2015 within the EU alone , it is positively essential for the Council , the Commission and the European Parliament to take joint measures to limit the environmentally harmful impact of air traffic .
But that is not a satisfactory state of affairs .
There can only be one response to this accident , and that response is 'disarmament now ' .
There is agreement on the four categories of people living in the refugee camps .
They have earned our unreserved respect , and we wish to assure them that they have our support and that the European Union , together with the international community , will do everything it can to help to restore human rights , or to be more accurate , to introduce human rights , democracy and also the rule of law in Burma .
As a spokesperson for the Turkish Ministry for Foreign Affairs has confirmed , Turkey from time to time carries out operations against the PKK , who have now , for the third time , declared a unilateral ceasefire .
But I believe that in a good family you can also say things that do not suit other members of the family .
During the last bilateral meetings between Czech , Austrian and German experts on 2 and 5 September this year , it was once again stated that Temel√≠n does not meet German safety standards and would not , therefore , receive an operating licence in Germany .
Edmund Stoiber was quite right when he said today that it is a matter of following the house rules .
That was another point I wanted to make .
These are opportunities - especially for Europe and European integration - of which we can avail ourselves here and now : knowledge of other languages , other cultures , other ways of life , everything that is so important for us as Europe grows together .
One goal must be to enable pupils constantly to update their knowledge and skills so that they are neither able nor willing to view a diploma or certificate as the end of a learning process or as a seal of approval upon something finally completed .
I believe that we , ourselves , in the European Parliament can confirm that we are actually , day by day , doing more in the way of learning , evaluating and passing judgment than ever we had to do at school or university .
I hope that a majority of
