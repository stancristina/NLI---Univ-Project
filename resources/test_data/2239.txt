Local authorities , because they are the best placed to do so , can and must work as agents for development to encourage partnerships in the fields of tourism , culture , small-scale industry and the environment , participating in setting up joint companies and micro enterprises , involving young people , women and the unemployed .
The joint motion , however , has many shortcomings , which we addressed in the motion tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left ( but which , unfortunately , was rejected ) and contains many negative aspects , specifically in failing to criticise the criminal justice and security aspects of immigration policy , in insisting on compliance with the Stability Pact and the monetary guidelines and in calling for the federalist approach to be extended in various aspects of Community policy .
This set of issues is sufficiently and appropriately developed in the Joint Resolution that has just been approved , despite the fact that it is a compromise text , which is why I supported the motion and voted for it .
We had to wait for the Spanish presidency - not a socialist one - and for the boost given by the new Portuguese government for the issue at last to be accorded the consideration it deserves .
It is also significant that the report emphasises the fact that responsibility for monitoring the implementation of Community legislation lies primarily with the Member States and must continue to do so , albeit with greater cooperation and supervision and not involving total centralisation .
( PT ) This report deserves my vote , because it is major step forwards in raising awareness of the complex interconnection between globalisation and the promotion of core labour standards .
Greater attention needs to be paid to women 's organisations when addressing the issue of involving social partners in defining policies on sustainable development and social cohesion .
Often , in this amazing bureaucracy that we are becoming , by the time we decide to act , it is already too late .
The time has at last arrived for peace and for hope .
They also have the obligation to contribute to steer emergency aid in the right direction and to guarantee that it reaches those for whom it is intended and does not disappear en route .

In addition to the inevitable trauma , the most pressing problems are to be seen at the humanitarian level , but also concern the much-needed reconstruction of the country , whose economy and infrastructures have been destroyed by the war .
The debate on this matter at the current juncture in the European Union requires me to make an assessment of the problem and a suggestion for its resolution .
The solution to this problem must involve three main measures , in line , in fact , with the rapporteur 's proposals .
To conclude , I wish to state that , in addition to the importance of plant proteins in the European Union 's food production chain , we must stress the strategic importance of these crops in the European Union 's Mediterranean areas , where the choice of crops is limited , and where , above all , there are few crops that provide farmers with options , but where these particular crops adapt very well to the unproductive land and the predominant soil in these areas , which is poor , limited and marginal .
As the document we are now debating states , the European Union 's current rate of self-sufficiency in vegetable proteins has fallen to below 23 % , as other Members have already said and which becomes all the more serious when you realise that , at world level , plant protein production has increased by 60 % in the last fifteen years and is largely concentrated in three countries .
Hence the importance of granting rotational aid to farmers to encourage the production of plant proteins in the cereal crop cycle , using fallow land , as we have advocated in other reports , and also the need to terminate the Blair House agreements , or , at the very least renegotiate them .
Mr President , Commissioner , the fact that we in this Parliament are some of the most frequent users of air transport requires us to pay special attention to all initiatives designed to improve the organisation , punctuality and safety of air traffic navigation and control services .
Thirdly , is it not obvious that the assumption of these new competences by the Union , to be exercised in accordance with the rules of comitology , requires the inclusion of a ground of competence which does not exist in the current Treaty , and even the definition of a common defence policy , which is still so far from being reached ?
We do not see them and , therefore , we are still concerned .
Some of the guidelines it contains could actually even call into question the high safety standards they claim to want to achieve : this applies to the opening up of the auxiliary service market , given the priority attached to improving results , which could lead to lower spending on staffing and equipment .
In fact , this matter takes on particular importance given the involvement of the military sphere .
The issue of regulation is of the utmost importance and , in this proposal for a package of four regulations for the Single European Sky , the need for the power and independence of Eurocontrol , one of whose main functions is that of a public service designed to ensure the safety of airspace , is , therefore , undeniable .
Today it is widely recognised that cabin crews bear a huge responsibility and are of increasing importance to
