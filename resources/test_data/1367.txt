on the principles of international law as stated earlier .
The Middle East is the original home of human civilisation .
It is good to see that the Council is considerably more unanimous today than we ever have been before .
However , unfortunately this is not sufficient , and on the contrary , as Mr Poos said initially , it is also about the willingness of the parties to negotiate and not least about the Israeli government currently bearing the main responsibility .
Mr Lagendijk said that it is unacceptable for resistance fighters on the Palestinian side to be executed by Israelis .
We have also received guarantees that this is to cease , but unfortunately this has not hitherto been the case .
Ariel Sharon actually bears the main responsibility today for reversing the trend .
So what can the EU do further ?
Just as Mr Napolitano said , it is important that we also act .
As I said , we have also demanded that the Palestinian side do all it can to prevent terrorism and to reduce violence .
Precisely as General Morillon said , the EU is currently more active than ever before .
I would like to say both to the Israeli side and the Palestinian side that this is not a question which concerns only you .
Instead it is about all of us in the EU having to do all we can to contribute to the peace process .
Today , we are working closely together within a number of areas , and our dialogue by and large comprises all the important issues .
In 1995 , we also adopted the New Transatlantic Agenda .
At the Gothenburg Summit on 14 June , the EU and the US will jointly stake out a clear structure and focus for continued cooperation .
In close consultation with the forthcoming Belgian and Spanish Presidencies , we have begun multiannual cooperation on justice and home affairs , focusing on combating drugs , combating child pornography on the Internet and supporting Russia ' s fight against organised crime and its consolidation of a society based on the rule of law .
In addition , we have emphasised the importance of concrete progress being made to solve the bilateral trade disputes which constitute a serious cause of irritation in our relationship .
It is highly worrying that the US , which is responsible for 25 % of the world ' s carbon dioxide emissions , is choosing to stand aside from an international agreement negotiated over a decade .
Prime Minister Persson and Mr Prodi , President of the Commission , have criticised the decision in a letter .
At the informal meeting of the environment ministers in Sweden , the Swedish chairman , Mr Larsson , stated that no individual country has the right officially to declare a multilateral agreement dead , and he expressed his hopes that the US would return and take part in the ongoing Kyoto Process .
The US admits the importance of finding global solutions to the problem .
We therefore welcome the US attending the environment meeting in Bonn in July and hope to see a constructive dialogue with a fruitful exchange of views .
In this context , I would particularly like to highlight our joint efforts to promote peace and stability in the Balkans , as well as our consultations on the situation in the Korean peninsula and the Middle East peace process .
I would also like to point out that a meaningful dialogue must also address issues on which the EU and the US disagree .
Experts are increasingly unanimous on the problems of global warming and its consequences .
Should our reaction lead to a strong anti-American position ?
We have to take the lead in the world with regard to ratification and continue the dialogue with the US in order to bring the country on board in the future .
Mr President , I will be extremely brief as I am aware that Parliament has other business to attend to .
However , if we are to influence the US on those areas in which there is no agreement , making contact with the new administration is not enough .
- ( SV ) I have voted against the motion for a resolution .
This initiative and its classification are , in my view , the wrong way for the European Parliament to handle such a fundamental constitutional issue as the entire EU decision mechanism , including the proposal to abolish the pillar structure in the area of justice in favour of the Community method with full co-determination for the European Parliament .
González Álvarez report ( A5-0133/2001 ) Fatuzzo ( PPE-DE ) .
" Mr Fatuzzo , " said Valentino , " we Italian , French and European fashion designers are extremely concerned .
We consider them dangerous because they are sexy , provocative and fascinating . "
Please help us ! "
Issues of taxation , retail monopolies , advertising , import restrictions and age limits should all be decided by the individual Member States .
Swedish alcohol policy differs from that of many other EU Member States .
We are convinced that European level is not the right level at which to decide on such detailed regulations for issues such as how alcohol may be displayed in shops .
I have voted against the Sturdy proposal .
The Council deeply regrets the fact that these hunger strikes in various prisons across Turkey continue to lead to the loss of human life .
Discussions with the Turkish government are ongoing , particularly within the framework of our deeper political dialogue .
Meetings took place in Stockholm on 14 March and in Brussels on 26 April .
Meetings have been held with the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Justice , with the prison situation high on the agenda .
