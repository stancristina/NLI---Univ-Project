it is just as Commissioner Patten says : enlargement must not be allowed to be merely an issue for the elite .
We would very much like to see a place on the agenda to discuss the nuclear power plant at Temelin , as in many Member States , especially in Austria , obviously , as it is next door to it , the situation is very tense .
I would like this proposal to make it possible to include the Temelin resolution on the agenda .
Mr President , as the European Union assumes new powers we might expect that transparency in this matter and parliamentarian monitoring would increase at the same rate .
The Commission must have a strong role to play in this process .
But the Council ' s decision seems to be leading to a situation now where the whole development of the security and defence policy in the political sphere can no longer be properly monitored , being , as it were , beyond that .
I demand a clear explanation from the representative of the Council , and I would be very grateful if the Commission were also to comment on the situation .
The principle of the freedom to pursue a trade is firmly upheld in the European Union .
I would ask you to reply now , as President-in-Office of the Council , and not so much as a representative of the French Government .
Mr President , Mr Veltroni' s excellent report received firm support in Parliament ' s Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport , and the same seems to be happening here , too , in plenary .
At the same time , it means a splintering of the media and more pressure on development and commercialism .
The audio-visual sector is of the utmost importance to competitiveness , employment , and culture , too , in Europe .
Amid this technological revolution it is vital to bear in mind the social and cultural importance of media communications .
For that reason , I wish to stress the importance of safeguarding public service broadcasting in the future as well .
As a certain European historian said , a person ' s native country in Europe in the future will be that person ' s native language .
For radio to remain part of the digital age development it is important to establish a DAB standard for it .
In this way we will avoid the problems we have at the moment with regard to harmonisation of the use of land , financial activity , and the expectations of the public .
In this connection I have to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work .
In this respect there has perhaps been too much anxiety about overlap , but I hope that , after this debate , this report will be as successful as possible as far as this is concerned .
These cases have increased dramatically in number recently .
In ten years the number of mergers has risen fivefold and there are about three hundred of them a year now .
It just shows what a furious pace this industry is moving along at .
It is not just a matter of pushing a cart ; it is a quite exceptional field , because information is at present the most important tool of production .
These are in a way beyond the control and vigilance of everyone .
While we are aiming at deregulation here , Commissioner , companies are tending to re-regulate : to make new agreements about the market that bypass the democratic monitoring and control systems .
As Mr Clegg said , there are obviously problems too between the European Union and the United States , such as the restriction on mergers in the case of Deutsche Telecom , which obviously has to be looked into .
Mr President , Commissioner Monti , ladies and gentlemen , it is natural of the market that companies in the telecommunications industry , which right now requires its players to invest billions and embark on enormous basic infrastructure projects , should try to seek partners in the free market , all the while honouring the rules and regulations .
Politicians and trust busters , such as Mr Monti , must not interfere in this current development in the market other than when the Commission has proper grounds to believe that a particular merger may cause distortions to the competition situation , so harming the interests of consumers .
On the other hand , the Commission must actively monitor whether free access to markets is being realised in all sectors , as stated in point 3 of Parliament ' s joint motion for a resolution .
Madam President , I would like to thank the President of the Commission and Commissioner Verheugen for having consented to this discussion with us .
Nothing is more important than this .
Neither is it of any benefit if state leaders travel to applicant countries and make hollow promises that membership is just around the corner .
Furthermore , national parliaments must be involved in these discussions , and we now have a good opportunity to say that we too in the European Parliament debate this matter regularly .
Eight years have passed , but hopefully we will be bold enough to tell the people that this process is now far advanced and is irreversible .
A referendum in itself is an absolutely splendid way of involving the people in making decisions .
Even in Germany they should , in my opinion , consider dismissing historical fears that referenda might be generally dangerous .
Why have we not started to discuss pan-European referenda or , for example , the right of citizens ' initiative , which , for example , they have automatically in Switzerland ?
