Last month , as Romano Prodi has just said , we launched a thorough evaluation of activities and resources throughout the Commission and we will fully report on that in September .
Our aim is to focus the Commission on essential policy priorities and on core activities in line with our strategic policy objectives for the next five years .
Inevitably , that will mean identifying activities that could and should be reduced or ended .
It means taking a very hard look at how the use of internal and external resources can be most effectively balanced in the interest of the Union .
It means allocating staff to areas of high-policy importance within departments and across the Commission .
And when that assessment is complete , we will be able to establish whether the resources at our disposal are commensurate with the tasks attributed to us .
If they are proven not to be , we will put the case for more resources to the budgetary authority .
If that does not meet with a positive response , the difficult issue of which of our lower-priority activities should be discontinued will then have to be addressed , not just by the Commission , but by this Parliament and by the Council too .
I do not make this point because of any desire in the Prodi Commission to retreat from activities or responsibilities .
On the contrary , as many in this House understand , I am setting out these considerations because we want to meet our responsibilities and meet them with full effectiveness and full accountability .
That means closing any significant gap between obligations and operational resources either by reducing activities or by increasing means or by a combination of both .
In each of the three pillars of reform , the active support and cooperation of this House will be absolutely vital .
The new activity-based management system , that the President just mentioned , will link political priorities to the availability of resources and consequently to the budget for the first time .
The role of the budgetary authority in the operation of ABM will , therefore , be vital .
Attempts to micro-manage the Commission ' s operations are clearly in no one ' s interest .
A resilient and practical interinstitutional agreement will , therefore , be a prerequisite for the efficient operation of activity-based management .
In human resources policy , the involvement of Parliament will unavoidably have to be as an employer of civil servants as well as a democratic institution to which the Commission is accountable .
Again , that will be a very demanding challenge .
And finally , in the crucial area of financial management where the Court of Auditors , the Committee of Independent Experts and other external and internal analyses have strongly advised radical change , the support of this House in implementing the recommendations for full security of money and value for money will be of prime importance .
In the limited time available for this statement , it is obviously impossible to go into the full details of our proposals .
I have no doubt that we will do that on several occasions in the coming months and years , and I certainly look forward to the questions of honourable Members this afternoon .
It is clear , of course , that in many ways the really hard work starts now , with the implementation of our proposals .
I look forward to working with this Parliament , with the Council and with the staff of the institutions to ensure that the reform strategy is put fully into effect for the benefit of the Union and for the advantage of all of its peoples .
There is effective legal precaution .
In the particular case that the honourable Member has in mind , not only did the Commission easily and quickly come to a decision to waive the immunity of a former Commissioner , but the former Commissioner herself advised the Commission of her desire that the immunity should be lifted .
I can see the complexities that concern the honourable Member , but I say to him that in the last five years there have been ten cases in which there have been requests from national legal authorities for the immunity of 26 officials to be lifted , and every single one of those requests has been met , and met with alacrity .
I think that the House can therefore be confident that not only are the civil rights of individuals who may be accused or required to produce evidence safeguarded , but so is the interest of the properly constituted legal bodies of every Member State in seeking to get information , or the right to interview or investigate anybody associated with the Commission .
As the Parliament ' s rapporteur on the staff elements of your report , Mr Kinnock , I very much welcome the fact that we are now starting the process , and if I may say to all colleagues here , we have a very important task to do , which will be absolutely central to the future of the Commission and its effectiveness .
And I make the point , before I move to my questions , that what happens concerning the Staff Regulations in the Commission has a fundamental role on our responsibility also as employers of staff because , of course , the European Parliament staff operate under the same conditions .
That will form part of the work that we will have to do and I sure that all of you today will want to engage in that process .
Now there were two points I wanted to pick up with Mr Kinnock , if I may .
The first one concerns the timescale of these important reforms .
Mr Prodi said in his very important opening statement that he had identified severe problems
