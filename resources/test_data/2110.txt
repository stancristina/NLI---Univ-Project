of spent fuel from 34 plants in 9 different countries was thrown into doubt and , indeed , Japan , Germany and Switzerland stopped sending material - and quite rightly so - to Sellafield .
This whole sorry tale has added to the UK 's reputation , as sordid as it is often inaccurate , as the "dirty man of Europe " .
I believe that all at Sellafield must accept collective responsibility for the things that have gone wrong and must act to improve them .
A number of improvements have been made : the new chairman of BNFL has undertaken a fundamental review ; a number of people have been dismissed .
There is undoubtedly progress .
However , there is a lot yet to be achieved and there is a long way for the UK to go , and for BNFL to go to re-establish its reputation .
I would ally myself with the concerns of Mrs McNally , when she asked the Commissioner to look again at these matters .
The fact is that the Commissioner telling us that the rules of individual Member States are more specific is simply not good enough .
We need high minimum standards and , in particular , we need those standards in the light of the accession of candidate countries , many of which are more reliant on nuclear technology than existing members of the Union and have much older generating capacity .
The importance of European Union action in this matter is that it will be a confidence-building measure , and what the public want are confidence-building measures .
I recognise and feel deeply the concern expressed by colleagues in the Republic of Ireland and Denmark .
The fact is that we need legislation to implement what is called for in the motion put forward by the three main political groups tonight : high minimum standards for the safe and reliable design , construction and operation of nuclear and nuclear-related installations , as well as for nuclear-safety management systems .
My group cannot support the Green motion here tonight .
We feel that it treats the matter in too gargantuan terms .
It raises the perfectly legitimate question of whether nuclear reprocessing should continue at Sellafield .
But one cannot conduct this debate in the terms employed by the tabloid newspapers .
We support the motion put forward by the three major political groups because we believe that improvements need to be made , improvements are being made , but that those improvements will be encouraged by an EU-wide approach to this whole matter .
We recognise too the great significance of this plant for employment in west Cumbria and we believe that should the future of the plant be thrown into jeopardy then the European Commission must come forward with special measures to help regenerate other employment in the area .
This is a saga in which nobody , least of all Sellafield , comes out well .
But it is an area where action at European-Union level really can make a difference .
Mr President , I wish to begin by thanking my colleague , Mrs Ahern , for raising this very important issue .
No one in this House could have been anything but appalled at the recent events linked to Sellafield , with the falsification of MOX fuel data and the Nuclear Installation Inspectorate 's report on the low level of safety procedures at the plant .
Following the initial defensive response by BNFL , it was only when that report was published that the real scale of the problem emerged , that the falsification of figures had apparently been going on secretly since 1996 .
Wales , like Ireland , has suffered from the radioactive contamination in the Irish Sea , due essentially to Sellafield .
There has been a theory about a link between a high incidence of childhood leukaemia , for example , and proximity to the Welsh coastline .
Now , added to that , we have a situation where any confidence the public had in the safety of the plant , and therefore their own health and safety , has been destroyed .
It is this crisis of credibility in the management of British Nuclear Fuels which may actually bring about the end of reprocessing .
BNFL was determined to press ahead with the Sellafield MOX plant to keep reprocessing going .
But one of the reasons why British Energy , which accounted for a third of Sellafield 's reprocessing work , decided to shift from that to waste storage was on economic grounds .
It was cheaper for them to store waste , and evidence published recently by the nuclear-free local authorities confirms this view .
So , with the problems of the environmental pollution and the effects on health , as well as the issue of cost and the debate about the cost , what justification is left for nuclear processing ?
It is not worth the risks associated with it and , as the resolution states , the Council , the Commission and Parliament must reconsider this whole issue , including the production of MOX fuel , in the light of recent events and in the interests not only of people in Ireland and Wales but also in the whole of Europe .
British Nuclear Fuels has an obligation to deal with the levels of waste that Mrs Ahern mentioned earlier in the safest way possible .
That issue too is one of great concern to me because an area of Wales has been mentioned as a possible site for storing low-level radioactive waste .
This is unacceptable .
A strategic approach is needed .
The nuclear industry has caused enormous damage already and we have to be certain that more and more communities and people 's lives are not blighted by its legacy in future
