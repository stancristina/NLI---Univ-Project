The Commission ’s draft takes no account whatever of the realities of life in most of Europe’s ports ; its intention of interfering in functioning , economically successful structures and using an enormous and expensive bureaucracy to impose on ports a competition that already exists in almost all of them , is intolerable .
If that is the sort of policy you want , Commissioner , then we are right behind you and will gladly work together with you in producing one .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Greens in this House reject the port package , not least for reasons of good form , since it was presented in haste by Commissioner De Palacio at her last part-session , that is to say at a time when she ought really to have relinquished office long ago .
The Commission also needs to get used to the idea that this House cannot be used as a repair workshop for bad directives .
They may attract the attention of the media , but they help nobody in this Europe in which we share to find their way to better and workable solutions .     .
Under no circumstances must the opening up of the aviation area be accomplished to the detriment of workers who may , in third countries , be employed under less stringent social security regulations .
Let me make it quite plain that those who want to enter the European Union from third countries , namely as immigrants or asylum seekers , deserve to be taken far more seriously and treated with much more respect than they are by this report , and it is for that reason that we have voted against it .     .
A diplomatic initiative on the part of the Commission and the Austrian Presidency of the Council helped to put a speedy end to this situation .
Having more gas traded within the Community does , of course , presuppose the availability of gas in the necessary quantities and that is why we also have to work at supporting the establishment of liquid wholesale markets .
There are , then , a multiplicity of options available to us .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Bartenstein , I would like to start with Ukraine , having been rather surprised that the gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine , which is an annual event nearly caused us in Europe to treat it as a European gas crisis .
If that is to be the shape of the future , then I urge them to make their case in clearer terms , but please can they spare us a debate on lifetime extension of the sort that is resuming even on the subject of the reactor at Ignalina ?
Both I personally , and the presidency as a whole , endorse the Commission ’s proposal for the creation of a two-month reserve similar to that which already exists at another level for oil .
The answer is a very simple one : it is because the international commitments made long ago mean that , in the absence of reform , the future of beet and cane sugar cultivation in the European Union will be very much in doubt after 2009 .
In my capacity as shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , I would like , in particular , to thank the chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , Mr Daul , and the rapporteur , Mr Fruteau , for their outstanding cooperation on the report on the reform of the common market organisation for sugar .
If we let it go through as it is , no one will lift a finger .
This is a most peculiar kind of development aid .
Their task is to implement the regime of the future market organisation in such a way that viable socio-economic solutions can be devised in cooperation with the trade unions and staff representatives .     – Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the aim of the present proposal for a regulation is to create greater transparency by means of increased public participation in the drafting of legislative texts , something which I very much welcome .
I believe that there is some confusion in this regard .
We must put these achievements to good use in the interests of human safety and of preserving the health of our environment .
We could have achieved a substantial improvement on this issue with a relatively small amount of money .
This is progressively gaining in importance : there has been a rapid increase in the number of people falling ill in Europe as a result of enteroviruses and noroviruses .
A real change in our modes of production and consumption is needed : inaction on this will come at a high price and have serious consequences , especially for the growing number of poor people in our society .
I should like to examine one point that seems to me to be very important in connection with this directive .
And this strength , this diversity , the numerous identities of Europe , make our Union what it is .
This is why we must begin by asking these questions .
This question of the security of energy supplies will be an important topic in the European spring summit .
We have to realise that SMEs could be the only real job machine in the Union .
We need that balance .
I must be frank with you : we are reaching our limits with the Financial Perspective .
Not head-to-head confrontation but hand-in-hand cooperation – that is my principle and my motto for this presidency .
It is not only about a document .
I think it is
