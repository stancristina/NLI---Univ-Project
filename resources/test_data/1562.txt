possibility .
I have previously voted against beginning membership negotiations with Turkey because it will be a very long time before it meets the requirements for EU membership .
The Copenhagen human rights criteria must be fulfilled .
The EU’s common agricultural policy and regional policy must be reformed before Turkey can become a member of the EU.
By tradition , world trade is men’s arena .
Gender affects our behaviour as economic actors .
Men’s and women’s work is valued differently .
Trade policy negotiations must take practical account of all the conventions , such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women .     Mr Guerreiro’s report on improving the economic situation in the fishing industry worries me a lot .
The ICES , or International Council for the Exploration of the Sea , again repeated the demand for a total ban on cod fishing in the eastern Baltic , but the Commission believes that it is enough for it to be reduced by 15 % .
The rapporteur says explicitly that the EU’s fishing fleet is forced to compete with third countries ’ fleets .
The EU is , however , showing its true face in this case : that of an uncompetitive economy that is prepared to do anything to protect its production , at the same time as excluding the world’s poor .     We think of sole and plaice as extremely good fish that are a great pleasure to eat , but future generations will not experience that pleasure if we do not now accept our responsibilities .
The same applies in the case of cod .
There is a connection here , which means that Amendment 14 cannot be approved either .
We could manage to calculate eight per cent instead of ten per cent .
Attempts to obtain increased flexibility would actually lead to reduced flexibility , as , if fish stocks are depleted , there is no flexibility at all left .
There is a deep-rooted notion in this House that all important phenomena such as this must be controlled by the EU.
We never see any convincing analysis of the level at which such official measures should be taken .
I contend that the European Parliament is guaranteed to be incompetent to decide a matter of this nature .
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance wants knowledge to come first , then regulation protecting the environment and health and then marketing .
Nanotubes are capable of destroying mitochondrial DNA , while nanoparticles on the skin can migrate to the brain and the lymph nodes and damage our bodies .
Aid policy , like foreign policy , is a national matter and , as such , ought not to be delegated to Brussels .
That is completely unacceptable .     It is the June List’s fundamental view that matters relating to fishing should be handled within the framework of existing international organisations .
As an example , the fishing quotas prescribed for cod in the Baltic Sea have been subject to extensive criticism by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation , amongst others .     The June List understands that there is a need to set identical requirements for organic products from third countries , as for those produced within the EU.
We also believe that this version of the resolution places too little emphasis on the fact that any measures to combat illegal immigration must be compatible with the safeguards and the fundamental rights of the individual laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms .
We do not entirely oppose paragraph 4 ( on an obligation to inform other parties when applying more liberal rules ) , but we are sceptical towards it , as it could be a first step towards total supranationalisation of the asylum and immigration sphere .     In the opinion of the June List , the EU’s common immigration policy is one of the primary causes of the tragic situation to which many migrants expose themselves when , in the hope of a better life , they embark on what can quite properly be called a life-threatening journey to the EU.
It is highly peculiar , as well as unacceptable , that the EU should have been experimenting with a common migration policy for a decade .
Nevertheless , it is not the job of the EU to raise objections to India’s domestic political affairs .
Furthermore , we also do not rule out the idea of India having views on the EU’s trade and agriculture policies .     We have voted against the report on perspectives of women in international trade .
In this report , the focus is on form instead of substance .
The fundamental rights of immigrants must be respected and should not be dependent on gender or on belonging to a specific group within society .
Mr President , I see that there is a great eagerness in this Parliament to offer opinions on everything under the sun .
I believe that most of my fellow Members desire the same thing .
If we really want to help poor and vulnerable people in the world , we should really come at things from another angle .
In the interests of consistency , it should , however , be accepted that , where the new Member States are concerned , a certain amount of interest offsetting might take place to prevent mass unemployment from being created in the poorer parts of Europe .
The Commission also regards this extension as part of a package in which the removal of subsidies for maize cultivation is also proposed - a step that would mean a significant saving of approximately EUR 35 million in 2008 ( with , according to the Commission , a total saving for 2008-2014 of EUR 617.8 million ) .
