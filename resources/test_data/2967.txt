The Danish train drivers are ready , and the whistle has sounded today .
Mr President , Ireland is one of the two countries in which a majority of people would regret the EU 's being dissolved .
It would , then , have been more natural to have asked the inhabitants of other countries whether they cared for the treaty but , instead , the Irish were asked to vote on it again , as in fact they are doing , faced with the threat that , if they do not , enlargement will come to a halt .
In all honesty , is there a single minister who would put the brakes on enlargement if the Irish were to vote 'no ' . Of course not .
Enlargement will continue .
This outcome was negotiated on the spot in Nice .
It can be called into play , irrespective of whether the Irish vote 'yes ' or 'no ' . I must also call upon the Brussels Summit to correct the figures .
The new weighting system is impossible to remember , even for ministers .
There should also be more flexibility in relation to the candidate countries .
We should be content to lay down requirements concerning their conduct in the common market and allow them to retain their freedom in all the areas in which there is no documented common need for cross-border laws .
Agricultural land in the Czech Republic costs 10 % of that in Germany .
Why not allow the candidate countries to keep their laws concerning the purchase and sale of land .
What would the Czechs say if Sudetenland were to be bought up with German euros .
Today , we have an excellent relationship with our neighbours , which I commend and consider to be a model for Northern Ireland and other areas with national tensions .
Without this , the best situated houses would be bought up , because the price of a German summer house is several times that of a Danish one .
My group has different attitudes to enlargement .
We hope that the many new democracies can breathe some democratic life into us so that we might obtain a slimmer , freer , open and decentralised Europe for all .
It is a little sad to see them excluded , because they have been left to languish in poverty for a far longer period .
Mr President , in my former speech , I said how very grateful I was to the Commission .
I should also like to say a big thank-you to this Parliament and to the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy which quickly reached a decision , with very broad agreement , to support this enlargement project .
Parliament showed the way and Parliament can now see the result .
I have heard many debates in this house , but never have I seen such huge consensus on a project as many-faceted as that to which we are here giving further impetus .
In Denmark , no one is surprised at the fact that Mr Bonde is now conducting a campaign against the new treaty .
He adopted an oppositional stance during the Cold War when he was against everything that strengthened the Western democracies against the Communist dictatorships .
He was in the opposition camp when we voted for the first time on the Maastricht Treaty , as he also was when we voted on it for the second time .
That is fair enough as far as it goes , but it is not fair enough if the Irish electorate is unaware that , in supporting Mr Bonde , they are supporting someone who is against the whole set-up and who has been opposed to every single aspect of European cooperation .
My apologies .
Mr President , I should like to thank you for the opportunity once again to discuss this very topical and difficult subject with the European Parliament .
When I was last here , I reported in broad outline on developments in the situation since the Gulf War .
It was expressed in a declaration by the Presidency on 20 May of this year , stating that the EU is calling upon Iraq to comply with the resolutions without delay including , specifically , the resolution whereby the weapons inspectors would be able to return , as anticipated in Security Council Resolution 1284 .
We unreservedly support all the efforts on the part of the Security Council and the UN Secretary-General .
The EU also welcomes the adoption of Security Council Resolution 1409 of 14 May , that is to say the resolution on the revision of the oil for food programme .
The permanent members of the Security Council are currently engaged in negotiations concerning a new resolution on Iraq , based on an American draft .
The United States has stated that it wants the weapons inspectors to have unconditional access to all areas , including the so-called presidential palaces .
Two subjects are absolutely crucial , namely the issue of a renewed mandate from the Security Council on the use of force , and unconditional , free and unfettered access by the weapons inspectors to all installations and areas in Iraq , including the presidential areas , which is to say the palaces .
We in the EU are satisfied with the Iraq issue 's remaining on the agenda of the UN Security Council .
On 30 September and 1 October in Vienna , the chief UN weapons inspector , in the form of the Swede Hans Blix , together with the Director-General of the IAEA , Dr El Baradei , who is responsible for the investigations into Iraq 's nuclear weapons programme , met representatives of the Iraqi Government to
