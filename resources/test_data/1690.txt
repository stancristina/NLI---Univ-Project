Burton Act , the real danger to European interests remains , since it is not possible to suspend the law relating to Iraq and Libya .
So it is simply not on for the USA to make commitments on the one hand and keep emphasizing how important it is to cooperate with us , while on the other hand it goes against the law .
But last year the Cuban economy recovered somewhat and now the USA is tightening the screws of the blockade even further , supposedly in order to promote the spread of democracy .
I have discovered in many areas of our Parliament 's activities that proposals and decisions were based on wishful thinking and a lack of realism .
A further proposed change is more technical , although also important .
Its root cause lies in the over-capacity of the EU fisheries fleet .
I therefore call again on the Commission to start and close negotiations in good time in future so that the proper consultation procedure can be concluded and a legal base adopted before payments are made .
Doubts have also been expressed as to its effectiveness .
Could you please either have the attendance register moved into the Chamber - there is plenty of space available behind you - or take steps to see that we put a stop once and for all to this quite irregular snooping in Parliament .
I had originally tabled an amendment on this issue .
For voluntary repatriation to work , we also need people to have the land rights which they formerly held .
We all know how many of these governments make heavy weather of problems such as the protecting the environment , and in particular the sustainable protection of the environment .
It was said in Rio that we intended to reduce the level of CO2 emissions from vehicles : so what is the situation now ?
That is why Amendment No 12 is also important , and the European Parliament should say unambiguously that condoms are a key to solving the problem .
Another proposal was that a condom production facility should be set up in Africa .
I could have understood it if the Council had said that a regulation was the wrong place for expressing such an intention but , at the same time , had decided to pursue it .
While that may not be much , it is something .
In general terms , vast amounts of energy are being wasted in the EU as a whole .
And Parliament , at least , intends to honour those commitments and the promises that were made .
You see , more effective savings can sometimes be made by spending additional money in a budget line meaningfully , rather than by indulging in a kind of axe-wielding frenzy !
Are energy providers now to take over banking too ?
In my opinion , the statement turns out rather more negatively , however .
This is just the kind of process that we do not wish to see .
That causes me a great deal more concern than one major individual scandal would have done .
The way to do that is through sensible structures .
Mr Hoppenstedt 's comments this morning were therefore all the more regrettable .
We made an honest effort to reach a compromise on Article 1 of the directive - on extending the concept of broadcasting to cover the new services - partly because the Commission had told us in the meantime that the promised green paper on the new services would not appear .
Secondly , the criticism that this is an attempt to subject the new information and transmission technologies to irrelevant regulation does not hold water .
A further important aim of the new broadcasting directive is to make major sports broadcasts freely available to the general public .
However , it should say 'particularly important sports events ' , since a particularly important event could be a fashion show .
As far as specific competition policies are concerned , however , we sometimes have the impression that the clock is to be put back .
With the growing integration of Community markets , the number of cross-border mergers has risen .
It is in the interests of small and medium-sized enterprises to stand by the ELISE programme , and when we see the Council 's difficulty in bringing itself to approve this initiative , we have to conclude that the Member States - in particular , my own country - are systematically blocking the decision in the Council .
It already has an answer , however , since it does not feel that it would be sensible to eliminate this criterion altogether .
We must not let our priority - combating unemployment - simply be sacrificed to the Member States ' attempts to bridge their budget gaps .
Responsibility for a policy of this kind also lies with our own institution .
To that extent , it opposes the Commission 's consistent liberalization and deregulation policies in the fields of transport , telecommunications and energy .
That is why we have made our misgivings clear , and I hope that in tomorrow 's vote we shall be able to make a number of amendments to this report !
Not only will major efforts be required , but also a very specific timetable , which must be practicable and verifiable .
I do nevertheless still have some serious criticisms .
The result was a procedure which made it possible to omit one stage from the normal process , thereby substantially reducing the firm 's costs and removing the need for it to dispose of highly toxic waste .
And it is an important area too , because the whole issue of waste management requires a fundamental solution , which will have a major impact on our quality of life in the future .
