a section on employment in the Treaty of Amsterdam represents an important basis for the construction of a coordinated strategy between Member States to achieve a high level of employment .
This , then , is an aim with which we must identify ourselves .
The fact is that while institutional reform is recommended before the time-limit for the formal adhesion of the 16th country to join the European Union , it omits , or perhaps it does not omit , to make a statement on a matter which really is essential for us .
In any event , it would be an illusion to think that history is made by laws .
But what we have done here is a step in the right direction ; a strengthening of the codecision procedure of the European Parliament and the democratic legitimacy of the President of the Commission .
Institutional reform could only take that principal place in a framework in which the codecision procedure of the European Parliament also played a part in the revision of the treaties .
None of these principles is satisfactorily enshrined in the text which came out of Amsterdam .
A further point which is self-evident is that only profound institutional reform will make it possible to create speedy and efficient decision-making mechanisms .
It is therefore important that in December the Council and the Commission should be capable of preventing the United States from continuing to maintain and impose arrangements which run contrary to the guidelines that have been agreed multilaterally .
I would request that the co-financing rules be revised so that women 's NGOs can play their part in the PRINCE programme , as unanimously approved by the Committee on Women 's Rights , enabling the NGOs to include factors such as the value of work performed by volunteers and set-up costs when calculating their contributions .
In this case , unlike that of the Single Act ( or 1992 Single Market ) , there is no quantification and no quantified objectives .
Because , with the single currency , I am afraid that any difference in taxation will cause distortions in the market which might penalize the objective to be attained .
To be specific , therefore , how can we reconcile a tax on energy , which is such a burden on transport , with the need to bring infrastructures and other resources closer together ?
If there were no specific proposal to amend the existing wording , I would have some reservations about the suggestion in Recital 10 ( Amendment No 3 ) , concerning the need for 'a Community academy for indirect taxation officials ' , because I fear that a single structure of that kind might lower the profile of that cooperation which is possible and desirable at national level .
I regret that there are further deaths to be recorded .
We are also requesting the Commission , and in my view this is the most important thing , to set up a system with the authorities in my country to provide financial and technical support and cooperation in technology and research to enable us to predict and prevent the recurrence of the devastating effects of storms which it is unfortunately beyond our powers to avoid .
In that context , we appeal to the Commission to turn its attention to re-scheduling and reinforcing the financial resources already allocated to the recovery of the infrastructures which have been destroyed in the autonomous region of the Azores .
I would merely like to put together three thoughts on the matter .
This therefore is a matter not only of material but also of political importance , and if we may say so , of solidarity .
We now need to know whether those funds will be coming out of monies already allocated to Portugal by rescheduling the present Community aid programme , or with new , additional sums provided by way of emergency relief , or again by increasing the budget and , for example amending the framework letter of the INTERREG II-C Community initiative , as has been requested in the Resolution of the European Parliament .
Spain/Portugal/The Azores
We plead , as some of our colleagues have already pleaded , for immediate action and additional aid .
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as I had an opportunity to see for myself last August , the government authorities and the various economic sectors of Cape Verde with whose representatives I had a chance to talk , are very much interested in the renewal of the fishing agreement with the European Union .
The overall costs of this are agreement are also subject to negligible or minimal increases : financial compensation of ECU 1 , 086 million ( 2.1 % up on the previous agreement ) , ECU 267 , 400 allocated to technical and scientific programmes ( 2.1 % up ) , and ECU 178 thousand to finance study and training grants , that is to say an additional 0.5 % .
This procedure should be observed at the same time as statements are sent to other competent national authorities .
It is important , Madam Commissioner , that the Commission should once and for all present its reports on the implementation of agreements and the situation with regard to local fish stocks , well before the terms of the relevant protocols expire , to enable the European Parliament to make a decision on their renewal .
This does not appear to apply to the agreement with the Ivory Coast , which is also mainly concerned with tuna-fishing .
I consider that the interventions we have heard , which put questions on procedural matters , have raised issues that ought to be dealt with .
With regard to the agreement with Cape Verde , I would like to stress the following points
