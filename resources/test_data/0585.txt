High rates of detected irregularities may just as well indicate the zeal of enforcement authorities as suggest corruption in the regulatory system .
The Committee on Legal Affairs has been even more demanding as regards price limits on services reserved for the universal provider , but it proposes the same 150-gramme weight limit and jointly rejects the 50 grammes laid down in the draft directive .
This Parliament is naturally on the side of these values and will continue to support them .
The same is true for other regions of the European Union , such as the Canaries and the French Overseas Departments .
In other words , the end of bananas in Madeira would be at least as serious from the economic viewpoint ( serious collapse of income for thousands of producers ) as from the environmental viewpoint ( destruction of the subtropical landscape and the rural world , increased erosion ) .
Mr President , as we know , this COM in bananas is of particular importance to the ACP producer countries and some outermost regions , as is the case of Madeira , both in terms of production and employment and in terms of the environment , because of the maintenance of productive vegetation , a fundamental issue for regional development itself .
Mr President , I should like to inform you that , on 29 September this year , Portugal also ratified this Treaty unanimously .
Lehne report ( A5-0368/2000 )
The proposals submitted in the meantime only led to the floor of the standard rate of VAT being fixed at 15 % - although the Commission had also proposed a ceiling of 25 % , which was not accepted - and to the system being extended until the end of 2000 .
This is not our view , and we have therefore voted to bring this deadline forward to the end of 2003 so that , once the euro has been in practical usage for two years , new solutions can be put forward .
Therefore , we also propose removing this requirement for unanimity .
Environmental noise must be brought into this lamentable picture .
I therefore agree with the rapporteur , Mr De Roo , when he proposes that we should waste no more time and transform this directive on the assessment and management of noise into a binding framework directive .
That is why I regard this Commission proposal , enriched by Mrs Patrie ' s report , as being so important .
Under these circumstances , I invite the Commission to apply the precautionary principle to mobile phones and to draw particular attention to the dangers of their use by children .
This abolition , which began to take place in the middle of last year , as we had anticipated , resulted in a dramatic fall in the speed with which projects were approved and payments made , to the point where the annual implementation of authorisations of this fund at the end of June 2000 was less than one per cent .
In addition , it still performs an important economic and social role , both in receiving payments for public services , such as water , electricity , telephone , etc. , and in paying out retirement pensions , disability benefits and subsistence allowances .
Other positive aspects of this summit are the fact that the unanimity rule has been kept for decisions on both the Structural Funds and taxation , key areas for countries like Portugal which still need the solidarity of the European Union and the use of the tax system for a policy encouraging investment and saving .
The amazing thing about the debate on Nice is the image that , when all is said and done , the Treaty has no father or mother but is nobody ' s child : the French Presidency has fallen over backwards giving excuses instead of plainly accepting the results of the IGC and the reasons for them ; the political groups corresponding to the Member States ' governments have done all they can to criticise .
Consequently , the innovative measures must not ignore economic and social development .
Therefore , this joint resolution , which is objective , clear , shows genuine concern and is not demagogic , has the earnest support of my political group ; sharing an economic , social and political diagnosis in which its concerns are well-founded , it does not allow any other interpretation of its text that may divide the Mozambican people .
We must foster a global vision of support for the elderly and for their families , particularly for women who look after elderly people .
These measures will have to be appropriate to the different specific circumstances of elderly people in terms of standards of living and financial self-sufficiency .
But this does not mean that the report ' s observations should not be taken into account in future , particularly in Kosovo , in order to avoid similar problems arising with identical actions promoted by the Union .
Furthermore , we believe the same will have to apply to financing for monitoring electoral procedures and , consequently , to cooperation with the OSCE.
Every European citizen contributed more than EUR 37 to the cereals budget in 1997 .
We must come up with a rural policy geared towards regional needs and fairness between farmers if we are to preserve Europe 's cultural heritage and the environment .
I too , like the rapporteur , whom I congratulate , wish to highlight the Lisbon Summit conclusion that calls for a climate encouraging the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises , and in particular a regulatory framework which is conducive to investment , innovation and entrepreneurship .
In its reporting procedures , the Commission must acknowledge the priority and the importance that we attach to these areas and ensure that these
