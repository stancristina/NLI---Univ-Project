reach rapid agreement on restricting noise levels world-wide .
Europe must be prepared to consult with America on joint , stringent environmental standards in the short term , but must not accept delays or give in to short-sightedness .
We have some serious problems to contend with on this score , such as the extremely noisy aircraft that land at the airport in Ostend .
I welcome the position adopted by Mrs de Palacio , and I am pleased that the regulation will enter into force on 4 May .
I too have questions about MEDA , not just for the Commission but also for those who have submitted these questions .
As far as I am concerned , our first priority should be a change of attitude .
The Commission proposed various amendments last year .
We must not carry on this way .
And fortunately we are very much of the same mind as the Committee on Budgets on that score .
Finally , a word about our amendment to Mr Ferber ' s report .
The rapporteur , Mrs Haug , cites four priorities , some of which could be described as dubious .
We should enter into a discussion of the key tasks with an open mind , and be prepared to learn from past mistakes .
This year too , discussion will focus on what we must do in the Balkans , and particularly in Kosovo .
My final point does not relate specifically to next year , but to the years to come .
We need to look with a critical eye at how this could happen .
I do not support the demand for a legal basis for a European policy on children .
You may recall that during that debate in November 1998 , the Commission announced that the report which was being drafted at the time on the functioning of the directive presented the best opportunity to consider revising the 1985 directive , and was the best means of doing so .
This document was intended , as I said , to stimulate reflection and debate .
The proposals for a potential revision , referred to in the Green Paper , must serve as guiding principles for open discussion .
That also explains why the Commission would call again on the Members of this House not to confine themselves to certain positions purely for reasons of principle .
I am aware that this is a very tricky business and that we must prevent any half-baked stories from getting into the papers .
I cannot help saying , Madam President , that unfortunately I have not heard Minister Gomes of the Portuguese presidency say a word about the "Echelon " system .
Nevertheless , the ELDR Group believes that this matter must be taken seriously .
What is crucial in this respect is the legitimacy of usage .
You know only too well what I am driving at .
My first question is this : is the European Commission prepared to close this software loophole in the course of a review of this directive ?
Firstly , there is the biotechnology directive .
I do not intend to comment on whether it was in fact a matter of translation error , as is being suggested , or intentional .
This is because the Netherlands has submitted a request for annulment of this directive to the Court of Justice , citing its "internal inconsistency " , among other factors .
Most of the time , the press reports are read with a certain element of interest , fascination or surprise , bearing in mind that the European Parliament is a House which comprises many chambers .
I think that a reaction from yourself , Madam President , would be wholly appropriate .
One would have hoped that , due to a heavy agenda , the reports would be spread evenly over these five full days here at Strasbourg , but that is not the case : on Friday , two reports have been dropped and only three oral questions are down on the agenda .
However , the agenda is not heavier as a result .
Just because the Council is not ready , that does not mean that we in Parliament cannot bring the matter up for discussion .
Despite earlier initiatives by the Commission and Parliament , the misuse of the Internet and its harmful and illegal content have only increased , and it is time and again apparent how difficult it is to combat child pornography .
This is also borne out by the studies carried out by police forces in this field with regard to under-age asylum seekers .
The police within the European Union work differently from the police in some candidate countries , as other MEPs have already pointed out .
The nature of the Internet is such that it has become easier to disseminate child pornography anonymously , rapidly and across national borders .
I do not think that we can seriously expect the Council to adopt this text , but that does not detract from my appreciation of the work which the rapporteur and the Commission have put in .
But anyone who is at all familiar with this sordid subject matter knows that the contact points are inundated with information and that - in stark contrast with this - the number of people who analyse this information is very limited .
Mr President , I would like to warmly congratulate the rapporteur on her report and would also like to thank her for the cooperation I have received in my capacity as draftsperson of the opinion .
The financial scheme of setting aside 26 million for structural measures whilst keeping ten million in reserve for contingency measures could never lead to the goal which the Commission has in mind , namely an actual spreading of the financial responsibility
