information , documentation and individual cultural identity , but which also has room for commercial broadcasting .
The new commercial broadcasters , on the other hand , who are totally reliant on the market for their income , are finding themselves subject to rules which have nothing to do with a free market , such as quotas and investment commitments .
Commissioner Bangemann , with his forthcoming green paper , and Commissioner Monti have a great responsibility .
We also object to the fact that many of the paragraphs call for Community action to be taken .
We are not forced to adopt their methods or approach .
We therefore wish to see this discrimination abolished .
I am also very disappointed with the Committee on Social Affairs , which has failed to put forward a single amendment and has simply buried its head in the sand .
Fourth , Commissioner Flynn , I hope you will support our amendments and urge the Irish presidency , as I now do the forthcoming Dutch presidency , not just to support our amendments , but also to press on with the Commission proposal from October 1987 , which was intended to fill the gaps left by the first two directives .
What is more - and I know that the Commissioner is someone who always follows the Court 's judgments to the letter - when it comes to the judgments regarding retrospective action and the time from which women , and in particular part-time workers , can claim their pension rights , I have noticed that the Commission is choosing not to apply Article 119 , as the Court has done this year , but instead has gone back to the Barber judgment of 1990 , which means that 14 years are effectively lost for many , many women .
Mr President , I know that time is short , and I do not wish to take up very much more of the House 's time , but this is a parliament , where people are supposed to listen to one another 's arguments and discuss them .
The PPE Group supports the Council 's decision , because now is the time to decide on this matter .
The posting of workers directive is a fundamental aspect of the single market 's social dimension , and is vital for preventing a competition war based solely on wage dumping .
Mr President , as several speakers have already pointed out , this proposal is a case of take it or leave it .
Mr President , the fair distribution of work is an important objective for my group .
All these factors naturally have a very positive effect on productivity and costs .
It also works much better in larger companies where it is easier to organize , whereas its advantages for smaller firms are much less obvious .
Mr President , the Council and the Commission have really taken a terribly long time over this issue of a reduction in working hours .
Now the debate has moved to the appropriate forum for such issues : the European Parliament .
This , as I see it , violates earlier agreements .
We abstained in the Committee on Social Affairs , so it is only to be expected that we do not yet agree with the report .
Coming as I do from the Netherlands , I should like to say something positive about the reorganization of work .
We are talking about regulating a trade worth billions , but we must be rational in our approach if we are to have any hope of tackling the black market in plants and animals , which , at an estimated USD 17 billion a year , is almost on the same scale as the illegal drugs and arms trades .
However , the sad fact is that this trade exists , and it has taken the Council , thanks to the French presidency , five years to reach agreement on the subject .
Then there is Article 16 , which creates new scope for penalties , including specific provisions for those who use irresponsible methods for transporting flora and fauna .
We also need to ensure that everyone is willing to cooperate .
There is no point in one country having much stricter regulations in a single market with open frontiers .
It would be nice to be able to talk about such important topics during the daytime for once , instead of tucking them away in the evening .
In this context , finally , it is extremely regrettable that a minor issue such as falconry should receive so much misplaced attention in such a vital debate .
Five years of discussions are already more than enough , I think .
We also support the rapporteur 's proposal to set up a special working party to deal with any implementation problems .
We all agree on the need for clean drinking water , but we do not all favour the same means of achieving it .
My own country , the Netherlands , launched an ambitious programme a few years ago to reduce the use of pesticides , but the results have been disappointing .
I do , however , feel compelled to endorse the words of Mrs Green .
Proof was yet again provided that the Union is powerless when it speaks with dissonant voices .
We must not underestimate the legitimate desire of our people to preserve the safety on which the social contract is based .
I must stress to you that our group will not be at all satisfied with a Treaty that does not take a qualitative leap forward , more specifically regarding common foreign and security policy , majority decisions in judicial cooperation , majority decisions in the first pillar , and European Parliament participation in decisions .
Renewal and creativity can adapt European society to growing globalization
