It is for this very reason that the response must be firm , here in Europe and in other countries where , as in Mexico or Guatemala , the situation has become so bad that there is even talk of ‘feminicides’ .
Violence against women is a breach of human rights , of fundamental rights , such as freedom , equality , life and non-discrimination .
We are talking about a serious social problem , and every possible effort will be required on our part if we are to put an end to it .
It is all very well to legislate , but it is also important to provide temporary aid , to provide education and to implement programmes such as Daphne , because all of these help gradually to put an end to this scourge and this persistent blot on our society .
Furthermore , the postal services ’ capacity to enhance social and territorial cohesion is fundamental in an enlarged and increasingly individualist Europe .
I would also like to add that , according to Article 8 of the Council’s Rules of Procedure , any member of the Commission or the Council can propose a public debate of this kind .
I shall end by supporting Mr Markov’s demands that the Commission study the impact of smaller lorries on road safety , promote cooperation amongst controlling authorities and hold seminars with social partners .
It is simply an adjustment , because the report was out of date .     When the negotiation was organised amongst the different political groups , it was agreed that no amendments would be tabled ; two political groups have tabled amendments .
All of them are European languages as well , they belong to the European area – or hyper-area – of communication , and have a European vocation .
The Commission , the Council and the Committee on the Regions have already put this proposal into practice .
From the information that I have been gathering , the densities laid down in the report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are more than acceptable in most of the European regions , but they could cause certain problems in certain very specific areas of the Union .
Due to numerous food crises , it has now also become a public health issue .
Furthermore , this proposal maintains the necessary flexibility with regard to producers , which makes this minimal regulation genuinely applicable in the countries of the Union , and does not lead — as is usually the case — to the unnecessary closure of farms .
I would also like to congratulate him — and I am now addressing the Commissioner — on his comments in the field of risk capital .
The reform of State aid for the period 2005-2009 must bear in mind that , even when regional aid contributes to true convergence , there are great internal differences in income and opportunities amongst the regions of Europe .
We are neither the judge nor one of the parties .
Finally , I would like to thank the Commission ’s technical team for the excellent , exemplary work of mediation and communication it has done , which has been professional and , I believe , very effective .
Fourthly , we would stress the exemplary values of the Cotonou Agreement , given its extensive application to 77 countries and the effectiveness and flexibility of the suspensory clause laid down in Article 96 , thereby making it the only agreement that has led to sanctions and that has functioned relatively well .
The report we are debating today is intended to put an end to this situation , increasing the effectiveness of the clause from a legal point of view .
We can implement a warning system to identify human rights violations which allows us to act appropriately and react in time .
In a world obsessed by short-term benefits and security , we cannot lower our guard when it comes to defending our universal rights .     Mr President , I am genuinely pleased with the high degree of consensus in this House with regard to the idea that the development and consolidation of democracy and the Rule of Law , as well as respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , are — though they should be more so — an overall objective of the common foreign and security policy and must be an integral part of the European Union’s foreign policy .
Furthermore , over recent weeks , the price of a barrel of crude has oscillated between 60 and 65 dollars , a price that would have seemed unthinkable a few years ago .
The directive on energy efficiency in buildings already contains certain provisions , on the use of biomass in heating , which need to be enhanced .
What is needed today , as has been said on several occasions , is greater investment in training and hence an increase in public spending and not , as this directive proposes , simply greater competition .
I must say that , in my opinion , the text approved in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection met these requirements .
Furthermore , this proposed directive from the Commission does not even deal with the liberalisation of services , because the central issue is the liberalisation of the labour market .
Services have been liberalised in relation to transport , communications , audiovisual transmissions and professional activities .
This financial pressure is difficult for us to endure .
I must say that we politicians and people in power sometimes fall behind society , and I say this because there are two aspects of the directive that are of great interest to me and that are unfortunately not going to be taken up to a great extent : on the one hand , the recognition of qualifications and freedom to work for skilled
