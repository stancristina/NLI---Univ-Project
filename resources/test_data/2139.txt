not been to Lapland to go and see what a real outermost region looks like .
Agencies and the decentralisation of agencies are part of regionalisation .
I do not mind that the Food Agency went to Parma – I can live with a Chemicals Agency – but we must be rational .
I am not sure that it is good regional policy to fly or take the train to Strasbourg once a month .
Commissioner , I welcome your initiative , it is an excellent one .
It is a very good initiative .
If that is the case , I am all for it .
I can say this even though I sit at this end of the table .
The problem with the European Parliament today is that we are putting up too many barriers and we should not do that .
For the first time , we are expanding beyond the borders of Europe .
Firstly , the interests of Cyprus must not be violated simply because of the presence of Turkey , a large country .
Turkey will be dictating to us how to proceed , rather than the other way round .
Earlier on , the leaders of a large number of countries emphatically demanded that Cyprus should be recognised .
I myself , as someone who represents a small country , am very worried that we will be allowing Turkey to walk over Cyprus .
They were so keen on the idea of an EU superpower that they paid no heed to the position of Cyprus , a small country .
Mr President , I compliment Mr Alexander , especially as regards the questions about the legal nature of the declaration .
I take this question very seriously and I am willing to ask for details of the ratification process from my counterparts in the Turkish Government .
We need to take into account that Turkey has a parliamentary system – thank God , it is a parliamentary democracy .
I am sure that as parliamentarians you well understand the order of business and will agree that it would be a very delicate matter and indeed questionable for a Commissioner to give guarantees on behalf of the European Parliament .
There is also a very strong revision clause in the EU declaration that the Member States adopted last week , which refers to 2006 .
They know that in order to make progress in the negotiations they must fully implement the protocol , as they have signed it and will soon ratify it .
The Commission remains ready to assist the United Nations wherever possible , as proactively as we have done , and we will continue this work with determination in the future .
However , let us be frank and open here : the keys to the solution are in the hands of the two communities and it is high time that both communities engaged in a serious dialogue with each other , so that Cyprus can become a Member State like all others , united and in peace .
Certainly , we also expect Turkey to continue to work constructively towards a settlement and support the resumption of the UN efforts .
Now that we have achieved this , there are some on our side who say 'no thanks ' .
Finally the striker is alone in the box , he passes the goalkeeper and he is just about to put the ball into the empty goal when suddenly the coach shouts 'stop , turn round and bring the ball back ' !
Moreover , it is difficult to understand why this House would want the Customs Union to apply only to Germany but not to Poland , to Greece but not to Cyprus .
Again , this may make sense to some but not to me .
Finally , and this is extremely important , I want cordially to ask honourable Members , for the sake of Europe , not to weaken our negotiating position by postponing assent to the protocol .
Please let us keep this main target in mind and , for the sake of our credibility and for the sake of Europe , let us vote in favour of assent .     .
As my colleague Commissioner Barrot told you yesterday , the Commission will have to reflect on the best way to achieve the objective shared by all three institutions on improving international rail freight services .     Mr President , the rapid rise in the price of oil has made everyone realise that it will not last forever .
It would be foolish now to squander resources on fossil fuel alternatives which are even dirtier than oil , such as liquid fuel manufactured from coal or oil shale .
As my colleague , Mr Turmes , said , most oil is used for transport .
As well as biofuels , we should aim to develop public transport .
The hopes and actions relating to the development of renewable energy sources are not having an effect quickly enough .
In the United States of America , wind and water brought a tenth of oil refining activity to a halt , but the price rose by 40 % .
Demand will go down , therefore , and in its place research , biomass and alternatives .
We have not , however , tried to draft laws restricting the stock exchange game which raises prices , as my colleague , Mr Goebbels , has said , or lessening the social inequality that results from oil .
We ought to stabilise oil prices .
The EU ought to support the breakthrough in new environmental technologies .
Biomass can be used in diverse ways for heating , for producing electricity and as fuel .
Renewable energy sources should account for at least 25 % of the EU’s entire energy consumption by the year 2020 .
