Member State .
Agricultural policy is being reformed by bringing producer prices closer to world market prices .
This would mean that farmers producing in relatively unfavourable conditions , such as those in Finland , will need more support than in the past : enterprise will be completely eliminated from this sector .
Enlargement to the east will increase the area of farmland in the Union by more than 55 % .
When Finland joined the Union , production was limited to quotas corresponding to the level which applied before enlargement .
Madam President , I should also like to stress how important the decision on universal service provision will be in the short term .
I should like to know whether Mr Bangemann has considered how the use of computer networks could increase the transparency of the Union institutions .
It has been said here that the institutions ' official documents ought in principle to be available to all citizens free of charge through the Internet .
Free competition alone is not enough to guarantee universal telecommunications services .
It would not be right just for certain operators to be saddled with obligations : a common system is needed which will create balance on the market .
There are big differences among the EU countries in this field .
From the point of view of the rapid development of the field , the problems of the future also need to be considered .
A good example of this is access to public information , including EU information , through libraries and computer networks .
Mr President , at long last the water directives have been put before Parliament .
This would be impossible to explain to the public .
When work is carried out , results are achieved .
In Finland , for example , high levels of trihalomethane in drinking water used to be a problem .
There will be an opportunity to return to the environmental protection of waters in connection with the future framework directive on the protection of waters .
Madam President , this problem has arisen because the report was originally drafted before Finland and Sweden joined the European Union .
I should like to recall something which Klaus Hänsch said earlier today : the European Parliament and national parliaments have different roles to play .
One must bear this in mind when taking decisions on practical matters .
It is not up to the Union to dictate to Finland , for example , when the shops can be open .
Let us rather talk about the freedom of the individual to decide when to work and when to have a day off .
The idea of imposing a uniform weekly pattern on people 's life is outdated .
Madam President , the representatives of the Suomen Keskusta party are pleased that agreement has been reached between Finland and the Union on maintaining the current restrictions on imports of alcoholic beverages until the end of 2003 .
I have always believed that policies on taxation and alcohol are matters for the Member States rather than the Union .
We tax alcohol relatively heavily , which both brings in a good deal of tax revenue for the state and curbs the excessive consumption of alcohol .
I therefore recommend that measures be adopted in the Union to raise taxes on alcohol considerably .
Madam President , may I thank Mr Schröder for this report , which provides a good basis for a general debate on interregional and particularly cross-border cooperation .
I wish to stress that cross-border cooperation can also be combined with interregional cooperation .
In order for cooperation at borders and cross-border cooperation to achieve really impressive results , it should be possible to monitor the effectiveness of the existing programmes more effectively than at present .
In my opinion , more measurable results should also be attained in the EU 's programme cooperation with third countries .
Mr President , this Regulation will be a fig-leaf to industry .
After this , it will be possible to say that everything in the garden is lovely as far as consumer protection is concerned and that we need no longer worry when we sit down to dinner .
Mr Bangemann , could you say why the safety assessments of novel foods are not public ?
It is therefore wrong to say that the Greens are irresponsible for not intending to support the adoption of this Regulation .
But the biggest mystery , Mr President , is who really needs genetically modified food .
I must therefore repeat it : what do you , Mr Bangemann , think about the fact that these safety assessments of genetically modified foods are not being published ?
Air traffic causes problems , and noise nuisance and damage to the environment are among the greatest .
On long journeys by air , delays recur and onward connections become more difficult .
From Finland 's point of view , greater involvement of the Baltic States , in particular , in European air traffic control cooperation is especially desirable .
The situation should also be examined at national level .
The benefits of coordination conferred by Eurocontrol and ATM , in whose work Finland also participates to some extent , are indisputable .
Finland is the only EU Member State which is still not a member of Eurocontrol .
Despite centralization , the greatest responsibility lies with the individual Member States .
Although a compromise can never be entirely satisfactory , I am pleased with the ultimate result as a Finn and therefore a representative of the European country most dependent on its forests , considering how enormously the proposal has been improved in comparison with the original draft .
Rather than a common forestry policy , we are now considering a common forestry strategy .
According to this strategy , the use and protection of forests remain matters for national decision-making .
