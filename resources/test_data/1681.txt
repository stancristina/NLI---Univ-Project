increase in trade will require extending the trans-European transport networks as far as Ukraine .
At present the plans for , and implementation of , these networks stop at the Ukrainian border .
Mr President , I would like to thank my colleague , Mr Carraro , for this competently prepared and timely report .
Companies ' profits can dive if a letter or dot is put in the wrong place .
This is a peculiar combination !
It is a strange game !
This is an incredibly undemocratic system in an incredibly important role .
But we need something more .
I would nevertheless like to thank the Commission and Mr Liikanen , who has worked hard to produce an excellent document for the Stockholm Summit at this serious point in time , which Mr Carraro , among others , referred to .
Madam President , we shall agree to this version of the text in its entirety only in the last vote by roll call , but there is a small mistake in paragraph 17 of the Finnish version of the joint resolution .
I hope the final version to be approved will be correct in the Finnish version .
This communication was so skilfully drafted in fact that we in Parliament were able to reach consensus both in the Committee and here in the plenary sitting .
Factors of uncertainty such as these hamper the success of the internal market and result in considerably increased costs , which European investors ultimately have to pay .
From the point of view of professional investors , it will be possible to switch quickly to the country-of-origin principle , but , from the consumer ' s point of view , applying the principle still requires greater harmonisation of the conduct of business rules that affect them .
This solution would , at the same time , be consistent with the electronic commerce directive , which was passed last spring , and which Member States are under an obligation to adopt as part of their own legislation by 1 January 2002 .
If these two directives do not work on the same basis , the position of customers purchasing investment services electronically will be different from that of consumers who purchase their services through traditional channels .
European legislators must ensure that a lighter conduct of business regime should apply to professional investors than to small investors , who need more legal protection .
Restricting the market for reasons connected with the general good is not , as a rule , possible either .
Commissioner , my report contains reservations with regard to the three categories of investor , as proposed by FESCO .
The Commission should clarify this and propose that , in principle , all who have opted for the level of protection intended for professional investors , that is to say , a lighter level of protection , should always be able to benefit from the country of origin system in cross-border services .
Another issue which merits further consideration on the part of the Commission is the application of rules for marketing and advertising .
Despite this , many Member States have included advertising rules in their conduct of business rules .
The problems in the present ISD have mainly led to difficulties of interpretation , so it will be important to ensure the amended directive is implemented consistently at national level , to achieve a successful result .
Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur , Dagmar Roth-Behrendt , who has done an excellent and thorough job .
The rapporteur has also hopefully discovered a way of influencing policy in the Council for the implementation of swift measures by calling for an immediate ban on the sales of products tested by using animals .
A derogation would only be granted in respect of products for which there is no other alternative to animal experimentation .
We have given in too easily to pressure from the WTO .
Naturally we need to ensure that products are free of risk to the consumer .
Labels must be clear , and allergies must be taken into consideration , especially with products intended for children .
The health and environmental problems associated with PVC are due to released chlorine , stabilisers and softeners .
These products ' life cycles are long and they remain in the ecosystem for a long time , which means the extent of the problems for the environment can at present only be guessed at .
We need to undertake a study as quickly as possible , and , as Mr Sepp√§nen quite rightly pointed out , one that is not just industry ' s own investigation .
The size of the problem is seen in the fact that the incineration of PVC can produce even more hazardous waste than that represented by the original quantity of waste , and , because it remains in the ecosystem so long , a landfill site is also a poor option for the disposal of this sort of waste .
As we have already observed , measures must be put in place after studies have been carried out , resulting in a ban on hazardous substances .
Mr President , firstly I would like to thank Mr Costa Neves and Mrs Buitenweg for their excellent reports .
Parliament wants to simplify EU administration and make it more efficient , underline the importance of the personal responsibility of officials , improve the way the budget is implemented , strengthen economic development and promote sustainable agriculture .
People must be responsible for their own actions in matters of efficiency and economy .
We shall return to this subject in connection with the discharge procedure for 2000 .
My own group demands that the problem of arrears should be sorted out more effectively , and says that we should be able to dissolve outstanding commitments after a certain period of time has passed
