some of Mrs Villiers ' amendments to this point .
Mr President , there is a new doctrine taking shape in international law , according to which no country can treat its citizens or the people living within its territory in any way it likes , and the sovereignty of the state can no longer prevent outside intervention when there are gross violations of human rights , not even when the government is legally or even democratically elected .
At the same time , the struggle against impunity is under threat .
Mr President , liberalising postal services could increase competitiveness in the postal sector and guarantee cheaper and more flexible services for the public ; it could also address the challenges brought by modern technology .
Social problems will increase , interregional disparities will grow , and competition will occur only in those areas where the economy is strongest , areas where there are more people and , especially , more businesses .
On the other hand , the losers will be the remote areas and their inhabitants , and the people that will not benefit from the new services .
I think this policy has been reasonably successful in Finland , as testified by the present public system .
You perhaps know that , in Finland , the president is not just the leading public figure or political leader , but she is also commander-in-chief of the armed forces , so this was quite an interesting and historic occasion .
Finally , I would like to say that it is now essential that we also raise this issue at the Intergovernmental Conference .
I appeal to you , ladies and gentlemen , not to vote in favour of the proposal tomorrow to moderate the contents of point 4 , to prevent gender democracy from being discussed at the Intergovernmental Conference .
Madam President , President-in-Office of the Council , Prime Minister Guterres , President of the Commission , Mr Prodi , on behalf of the Group of the European People ' s Party and European Democrats , I have to say that we are mainly in agreement with those ideas which Mr Guterres and Mr Prodi have put forward here .
As far as the prosperity of the citizens of the Union is concerned the most important task is to try to maintain sustainable economic growth in the area , all the time seeing to it that there is an increase in regional equality with respect to prosperity and that more and more people are able to earn a satisfactory income from their work without having to resort to social benefits .
Despite the diverse nature of these processes , they must have one common purpose : to improve people ' s quality of life in the Union .
Often , however , national considerations , and sometimes ideological resistance also , mean that these tools do not get used .
The most important task now is to remove the barriers to creating a real European home market as quickly as possible , instead of continuing to manoeuvre , in many sectors , within a framework of fifteen separate home markets .
Now , with the rapid advent of electronic commerce , and with the speed at which we process and utilise transfers of data reaching new levels , we need to move at Mika HÃ¤kkinen Formula 1 speed at the very least .
The opening up of competition that has already been agreed for the telecommunications industry , as with the energy sector also , will create new , much-needed jobs and bring down prices for both industry and consumers .
A basis for all this is created through education and training , and research , however .
These are obviously information technology , electronic commerce , tourism , and , for example , services for the elderly , as our populations are undeniably ageing all the time .
There are two issues that must be emphasised both by us and the Commission and the Council , and we must always draw attention to them .
Coordination is natural in many sectors - within the framework of the tasks of the Union also - to avoid overlapping , but healthy , honest competition is still more important than coordination , including in many non-commercial sectors .
In the achievement of our goal we wish to stress the importance of the European model of society , and , at the same time , the notion that it cannot be a rigid , stagnant system , one based on advantages gained in society , but it must be one that develops as society changes .
A certain change in working methods is in danger of becoming a social problem for the positive development of human relations : telecommunications , the Internet , the terminals at which we work , and television , which already seems like a venerable , ancient medium , are threatening to give the relationship between man and machine a key role in society .
The Commission refers , appropriately in my opinion , to deficits that hinder the growth of employment in the Union .
We might mention the skills deficit as one example .
Some are suggesting importing a trained elite into the Union area .
It will be difficult to conduct a sober policy , one that produces results only very slowly , which must be implemented here and now , if we are presenting the citizens of Europe with such a picture of the future as this , while they themselves fear for their jobs .
Whenever I have been involved in development work I have observed that this approach has , thankfully , over the past few years been taking the place of the old paternalistic aid-oriented ideology , where the so-called developed countries thought development was a matter of transferring our way of life to the less developed countries
