came with some remarks .
I may well have upset him : if so , I apologize .
But I do not think that that means I said I forgive his violence towards me .
The matter is closed as far as I am concerned .
The Council 's regulations have always been totally hypocritical .
But , of course , it is easier to score animal welfare points off helpless Inuits in Northern Canada than here in Europe , where the worst that can happen is to tread on a few voters ' toes .
Another objection was that the Inuits of Northern Canada can only live off tourism , in the style of Marie Antoinette , who suggested that the starving people of Paris should eat cake if they were unable to buy bread .
But the Environment Committee and Carlos Pimenta as its rapporteur have sensed that the Commission has not followed Parliament and implemented the regulations .
So this agreement does not have a chance .
It was thrown out , irrespective of what was in it .
It contains both healthy common sense and animal welfare .
Madam President , there has been a great deal of talk this year about simplifying Community legislation .
It is therefore remarkable , as the rapporteur has also said , that vertical directives on food for special nutrition are still being put forward .
If we continue like this , there will be nothing which is not regulated .
First , they send a signal to the population group in question that foods labelled in a given way are the most appropriate to east .
There are quite ordinary foods which cover the need .
Second , foods for the special groups are often sold to consumers at inflated prices , precisely because ordinary consumers believe they are better than ordinary foods .
And here I think we are at the heart of the matter : precisely because it is a special directive for sportspeople which the Council has added .
After all , sport has become the latest industry , with totally absurd lifestyle requirements , performance requirements and above all high earnings and not least profits for the people moving on the periphery of the sporting world .
Of course there are special cases where special directives are in order , and particularly when it comes to food , but they must be limited to groups which are known to have special needs .
Madame President , I would like to agree with some of the things which the previous speaker , Mr Liese , said about speed in dealing with resources .
Also , there may well be some people who think that it is rather amazing that we are standing here and talking about how to aid NGOs because , after all , NGOs are just that - non-governmental .
Above all , they can look at the people they are working with on an entirely different equal principle , because they are not burdened by government bureaucracy , rules and regulations , having to justify every step etc .
So NGOs should be supported .
On the other hand , the responsibility for how they are supported is still a democratic matter , and so democratic control is still needed .
But it is impossible to exercise democratic control in a completely closed system , and that is why I would like to emphasize the third section of Amendment No 7 , which says that meetings of the Committee of representatives of Member States which assists the Commission should be public unless there are convincing reasons to the contrary .
Openness is difficult , people have a tendency to meddle , but we are better off with it than without it .
Mr President , I am pleased that we have here a proposal which focuses on organic solvents .
We should therefore strive to limit their use as much as possible .
As Mr Blokland said , this is seen to a large extent among painters who are in daily contact with these chemicals .
This experience should be included in the directive which we are considering today , because public health is not just a leisure concept , but is indeed also a topic for the work environment .
But hopefully the Commissioner will explain that more fully .
I also see a clear connection with the directive on chemical agents for which Freddy Blak is the rapporteur .
I fully support the amendment which was proposed by Mrs van Putten and adopted by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection , which includes health risks from occupational exposure , and also the amendment which clarifies that Member States which are ahead of the Community with regard to the substitution of dangerous organic solvents can maintain tougher restrictions .
As far as openness is concerned , the presidency should secure the support of seven other countries in the Council to change the Rules of Procedure so that every meeting and every document is automatically open unless a 2/3 majority on the Council decides otherwise .
The principle was adopted unanimously in Parliament 's Committee on Institutional Affairs and is included in the report by our New Labour colleague who presided over the sitting , Mr Martin , which was adopted by a large majority in this Chamber .
EU legislation is impossible to understand for ordinary voters .
You never know whether you have got everything .
Every department which needs an amendment will thus be forced to make the legislation accessible to people other than those who have specialist legal departments in Brussels .
And the existing body of law , comprising 20 000 directives , regulations and other legislative documents will be halved simply by recording the amendments separately .
You could then go further by compiling laws on the same subject and thin out the legislative jungle .
