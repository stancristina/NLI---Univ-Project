Finally , the admission of Turkey would lead to massive immigration of Turks into the EU , and even bigger parallel Islamic societies would take shape .
Europe simply cannot live with large population groups in the EU rejecting our culture .
It is important not to confuse the attitudes represented by Turkish diplomats and certain intellectuals and politicians with those found in the rest of Turkey’s very class-divided society .
If Turkey were thoroughly democratised , as the EU wishes , the people would , unfortunately , without doubt take a democratic decision to introduce an Islamic state without democracy .
There is not an Islamic country in the world that meets the Copenhagen criteria , and Turkey is hardly likely to do so either , even if the EU asks it to .
We should honestly say to Turkey that there can be no question of membership of the EU , and we should not hold out empty promises to the country .
The European Council decided in Helsinki in 1999 that Turkey is a candidate country .
The biggest requirement of a candidate country is , as Mr Oostlander said , that it fulfil the Copenhagen Criteria .
Turkey does not at present meet all these conditions , but it is on the way to doing so .
There is no doubt that it is precisely the EU 's demands that have contributed significantly to the democratic progress that has taken place in Turkey , and a signal from the European Parliament that Turkey cannot become a member of the EU , or that Turkey must be given special status would undoubtedly put a stop to this positive development .
With Mr Oostlander’s thorough , balanced and comprehensive report , the European Parliament must , however , here and now send a signal to the European Council that Turkey is to be treated like all previous candidate countries .
Last weekend , the president of the HRFT , Yavuz Önen , received an award at the national congress of the June Movement for his and the organisation 's courageous struggle for human rights in Turkey .
The HRFT is threatened with closure as a result of several court cases against members of its leadership , including Yavuz Önen .
The HRFT has five centres for the rehabilitation of torture victims , and a thousand active volunteers .
The many victims of torture would be left in the lurch .
The state and the authorities constantly try to harass the centres in their work on court cases , and doctors are threatened with losing their jobs at the public hospitals if they work for the centres .
I call upon Parliament and the Commission carefully to monitor the ability of the Turkish human rights organisation to carry out its very necessary work for human rights in Turkey .     – The June Movement has today chosen to vote in favour of Turkey being treated like other candidate countries and having to fulfil the Copenhagen criteria , particularly where human rights are concerned .
The June Movement is fundamentally opposed to an EU Constitution and a common security and defence policy .     Madam President , there are more than 63 of us who , as Members of the European Parliament , have tabled a motion of censure on the Commission , not because we lack confidence in all the Commissioners but because it is the only means we have of attributing responsibility for the Eurostat scandal .
There are 67 signatures , 60 of which were verified a couple of hours ago .
There should now , therefore , in any case be 64 signatures with the services , and the Bureau thus has no other choice than to note that a motion of censure has been tabled with 63 signatures , in other words the necessary number of signatures .
It must therefore be placed on the agenda within 24 hours , and there must be a vote within 48 hours .
I hope that the President is in a position to note that the 63 signatures have now been obtained and that the services are not interpreting the Rules of Procedure properly by trying to get people to withdraw their signatures .     – Mr President , we are a group of MEPs who wish to attribute responsibility for the Eurostat affair .
We have done so not because we want a head on a plate , but because we quite simply wish to attribute responsibility for the affair .
The Bureau now has 67 signatures .
Since yesterday evening , the Bureau therefore owes it to us to give official notice that a motion of censure has been tabled , and this must therefore be scheduled for debate within 24 hours .
It is not our wish to hold the vote at that time .
It is not , however , certain , of course , that anything will be put to the vote at all during the May part-session .
The aim is nothing more and nothing less than that , so if , between now and May , the Commission itself can attribute responsibility , there will be nothing to vote on in May .
If , however , it cannot attribute responsibility , there are no methods available to us other than that described in the Treaty , and the motion of censure must therefore be voted on .
We are very annoyed that this vote must take place in May .
We could therefore have had the vote held this week too , if the services had been willing .
I call upon the Commission to attribute the political responsibility itself and so get this matter out of the way .     The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have today voted in favour of Mr Deprez ’ report ( A5-0267/2004 ) .
We are nonetheless aware of
