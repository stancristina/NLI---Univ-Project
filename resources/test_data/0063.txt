This has led to a reduction in private-sector demand on the market for consumer goods and high-value consumer goods , and , therefore , when private-sector demand falls , when consumption falls , there is nothing one can do but call on public-sector demand to sustain the economy .
This public-sector demand cannot come from individual Member States , because the individual states can no longer develop a monetary policy because there is the euro , they cannot change exchange rates , and they cannot create a development policy , for the simple reason that they have to keep within the Maastricht parameters .
I remind you that my government has drafted a record three hundred and fifty bills and decree-laws , two hundred of which have already been passed by our majority in parliament .
I will suggest you for the role of guard .
No diplomacy , no policy in history has ever been successful without the support of adequate military strength .
This independence leads them to be constantly critical towards the one they consider the boss .
It has been practically my only hobby since football left me behind .
This is our hope ; this is our undertaking ; this is our goal .
If you are all unable to understand irony , I am sorry .
At these moments the Commission will carry out its mandate - a mandate that is not only executive but also one of instigation and proposal - I repeat , leading on in terms of the policies and collaboration that we have built up over these years together with the European Parliament and the various Presidencies .
Firstly , I must assure you all that we shall always be true and strict guardians of compliance with the Treaties and the new Constitution .
( IT ) Mr President , my greetings to the representative of the Commission and all the Members of the European Parliament present in the Chamber .
The 1997 Peace Treaty laid the groundwork for a broad-based de facto autonomy under the Presidency of Chechen leader , Aslan Maskhadov , while guerrilla groups continued to be active throughout the country .
The situation on the ground is extremely difficult : the local economy is falling apart , there is contention within the pro-Russian administration , there are terrorist threats from the separatists and brutality , and violent military action from Russian militias .
This outcome has demonstrated that the Chechen people , weary of war , have chosen the political solution within the Russian Federation .
Nevertheless , despite the amnesty , attacks on the ground are continuing , prompting , as a result , harsh responses from the police force .
The international community has been actively following the developments and the initiatives of Moscow .
We now expect to see an about-face in terms of human rights and we call for the punishment of those guilty of abuses .
The possibility of launching a European Union initiative in Chechnya in the future deserves closer examination .
What sort of political process is this ?
The rest is pure and utter garbage that we are inventing in the name of interests which we do not want to admit to .
The former President , Mr Maskhadov , must take part too , and he cannot be dismissed so hastily , Mr Frattini , as a rebel separatist .
What has sugar got to do with rural development ?
It is certainly an honour since Italy has , from the very beginning , been among the Court 's major supporters and has given its name to the Rome Statute .
Action in support of the Court will remain an essential component of the Union 's foreign policy measures .
Fourthly , the European Union will continue to uphold the integrity of the Rome Statute , including in our relations with our friend , the United States of America .
I will not repeat what everyone already knows , but I would like to point out how , as far as Italy is concerned , we intend to proceed during this Presidency .
We heard yesterday that US military assistance has been withdrawn from some countries , including five which are about to join the European Union , which have declared that they are not amenable to such agreements .
By putting an end to impunity , the Court will strengthen the supremacy of the law and make a fundamental contribution to peace .
As in the past , the European Union , and now the Presidency of the Council , will use its frequent contact with the Israeli authorities in order to highlight the importance of the free movement of citizens of European countries , with European passports , who intend to travel to and from the occupied territories .
It is based on an action plan which is being implemented according to plan and a regularly updated schedule .
An updated report by the Presidency on activities related to the fight against terrorism was , as you know , submitted to the Council during the June 2003 part-session .
( IT ) Terrorism can never - I repeat , never - be justified when women , children and innocent people are killed and when civil life is affected .
I repeat , I am not aware of the launch of a pilot project , but in any case , the reference to the obligation of absolute respect for fundamental rights and freedoms can neither be removed nor toned down .
The Council was extremely pleased to see an end to military action and the unanimous adoption of Security Council Resolution 1483 on post-war Iraq .
( IT ) All I can say to Mrs McKenna is that the European Union has already addressed the issue on various occasions , including during meetings of Ministers for Foreign Affairs - as I believe it will
