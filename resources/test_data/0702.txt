section is in fact a system of rewards and punishments .
This may be a fact , but it is not sufficient to make us resort to such measures .
In practice , however , farmers do a very difficult job , with many imponderables , dependent on thousands of external dangers , not only weather conditions and natural disasters , as has been mentioned here today , but also decisions taken by technocrats at a European level .
The question to which there should be a very clear answer , at least from the European Parliament , which is the only elected body of the Community and is considered , for that reason , to be closer to the people of the European Union , is : who is responsible for this unacceptable situation ?
Unfortunately the present report does exactly the same , as it insists on leaving it up to economic and monetary union to address unemployment .
The result is the same .
Secondly , because it is the final contribution of a colleague who is greatly valued by all of us and who has contributed much to the European Union , before he devotes himself the day after tomorrow to defending Community law from another , very different and even more distinguished bastion .
Nor did we manage to breathe a sigh of relief before the German Supreme Federal Constitutional Court made the decision , concerning the Treaty of Maastricht , to call this principle once again into even greater question throughout the nineties , this time from a different standpoint .
A development which creates new conditions and facts in the field of law , which establish opportunely the observation of the Ancient Greek philosopher , Theophrastos : not the things for the laws , but the laws for the things .
The value of the report that we are now debating lies in exactly this point , that in its content , with the very valid argumentation that we have heard this evening by the rapporteur , it rejects any tendency for the substitution of supreme national legislative bodies in a task that belongs exclusively to the Court of the European Communities .
Because only the latter guarantees the independence and unity of Community law and order .
Following its interim agreement with Greece , the economic activities across its southern borders take on even greater significance .
Closer ties between the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the European Union must be given support .
In other words , we are entrusting the care of the sheep to the wolf .
The question is , are you in a position to change policy ?
Eighteen million people out of work in the European Union .
And of course the nightmarish circle gets even bigger when their families are included .
The special summit on employment may prove to be historic in the true sense of the word .
But I think it is a game , played out each year , which has its technique , its skill , its difficulties , its fun , but essentially does not give the European Parliament the power to set its own course and to question some of the more basic aspects of the move towards integration within the European Union .
Unfortunately , Mr President , I must stop .
Naturally we obviously share the worries of Mrs Pollack that indeed there are likely to be such effects .
In any event , however , I would like once again to assure you that the experts will direct their efforts to this end in order to ascertain what exactly the future repercussions in Europe will be .
That , however , did not prove possible .
For that reason , therefore , after the cancellation of the invitation of interest , the decision was taken to finance twelve projects .
For those reasons their request was turned down .
Mr President , I would first of all like to make it clear that foundations which are active and submit proposals in the public health sector have the possibility of submitting the same proposals to corresponding programmes of the European Commission and the European Union which are directed at public health .
In this particular case it was unable to escape from that framework .
But the deadline for this programme had already passed .
In the meantime , however , there have been budget allocations , which the European Parliament itself has registered - and I wish once again to thank Parliament for this policy initiative and the policy commitment which it undertook - so there were available funds that had to be allocated in accordance with the policy intention expressed by Parliament .
Madam Commissioner , I did not understand all the technical details you mentioned but I imagine your services will know more about them than we do .
I also requested to know what measures the Commission was going to take .
The first thing I would like to say , and I am very glad that Mr Van den Broek is here today , is that Rule 90 has not been observed , that is , that the Commission would make an announcement when it received an instruction from the Council to work out an agreement , as prescribed by Rule 90 .
That is one point .
The Third Finance Protocol was also signed .
Unfortunately , it was never implemented .
It is true that , as I pointed out , we are making progress and we are ratifying these agreements , and , all right we are ratifying them in a rather piecemeal way , but there is , I would say , no common ground .
In other words there must be a superordinate multilateral agreement , mainly concerning the railways and not cars , to enable these countries to one day sort out their rail network
