the laundering of money and to seize the proceeds of crime .
I cannot answer the specific question concerning the repatriation of capital illegally transferred to banks of the Union by former dictators , since this question falls outside the scope of the Council , as the honourable Member was notified in the first part-session of October 2001 , in answer to an identical question he then posed to the Council .
Everyone is in favour of conflict prevention .
Maybe the most straight-forward point , yet very tricky in practice , is the cooperation between the European Union and the OSCE.
A second point in my report is the European Civil Peace Corps .
It is no longer acceptable for us to talk about some or other EU policy , for example in the field of agriculture or trade , of which we are of the view that it should serve , for example , to better develop Africa ' s economy , while at the same time continue to apply components of that policy - and I would cite the well-known export subsidies - of which we know that locally , in Africa for example , they do not have a stabilising effect .
This was clear from the difficulties in setting up this rapid reaction force .
This explains the flurry of activity which is also especially being generated by the European Union at the moment in areas of tension or precisely where tension has been averted .
In my view , the unity of the European Union , particularly in this field , is a direct security interest .
The European Union is the perfect organisation to play a greater role in preventing conflicts , resolving these or in the subsequent reconstruction .
The aim of conflict prevention is to prevent violence or recurrence thereof by intervening in good time , mainly by using civil instruments .
But ultimately it is also about political will .
Since 11 September , the Americans have come to realise that our responsibility does not stop at our own borders or the countries that are of strategic importance to us .
Not only economies are interconnected worldwide , but so too is human suffering .
However , believers all over the world not only believe , they know for certain .
Recognising greater international connections , he calls for an extensive role for the EU.
This requires an integral approach , as has already been underlined by many fellow MEPs .
Mr President , Iran is particularly noteworthy since it is an area that is surrounded by all manner of countries undergoing turbulence : Afghanistan , the southern Caucasus , Iraq and further away , Palestine .
We are on the side of the Iranian reformists .
We must lend a truly helping hand .
Despite the fact that classification bureaux were involved and despite what has happened with , and is suggested about , double hulls , I should briefly like to focus on the port state control , for in the final analysis , what matters is that inspections should become effective .
Secondly , I would mainly call for a prompt completion of the Erika II , and for accelerating the process in the light of the tiresome pace on the part of industry with regard to separate funding and such like .
It also illustrates that the report is broad-based .
The first success has therefore been achieved .
No, I would clearly draw a distinction between two different situations .
As far as I am concerned , you can also plug into the time schedule that was chosen there and take the 2003 spring summit as a point of reference instead of that of Barcelona , because the topic will not feature on the agenda there .
This is , in fact , a true form of eating , and is possibly underestimated .
I would therefore urge the Commission to do something via the Court of Justice , so that Member States are forced to adapt to the realities of the internal market in one way or another and will no longer discriminate against those entitled to pensions .
The EET scheme , in which premium contributions are not taxed but in which the payments are taxed , can then offer a direction for the mutual harmonisation of the fiscal rules concerning pensions .
An example of this is the working party which is being chaired by the British Minister , Mrs Primarollo .
The second point concerned the pan-European pension funds , also mentioned by Mrs van den Burg and by Mr Pronk , I believe .
The verdict in this case can be expected next year .
Precious little has happened in this area over the past six months under the presidency that is about to come to an end .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , you have concluded the second reading of the draft budget .
As regards the report on the classification bureaux , the most important subject for the Liberals too was liability .
In the first and second readings we argued for a ceiling on the liability of classification bureaux , since the latter organisations are only one element in the chain of liability .
Hatzidakis report ( A5-0344/2001 )
My group is glad that , immediately after the Dutch Homosexual Marriage Act came into force , the responsible secretariat in the Commission recognised such marriages where civil servants employed by the Commission are concerned .
Unfortunately , this type of fishing does exist in the shape of fishing vessels sailing under flags of convenience .
This makes it crucial that the elections are able proceed in a normal way , and that the international community continues to insist that they are .
