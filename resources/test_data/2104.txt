prices is crucial .
The disincentive of high capital costs of connection to the grid from remote renewable sites and the prevention of transmission penalties are other issues which the directive should tackle .
I hope that the Commission will take note of these points .
I would urge support for the amendment to assist the promotion of renewables in the remote islands of the Community .
I am sure that this was an oversight in the drafting of the text .
I have to say that the British Labour Members will vote against the exclusion of waste incineration from the definition of renewables , on the understanding that this refers to material which cannot be recycled .
Mr President , Mr Gomes for the Council and Mr Liikanen for the Commission this morning have both made very clear statements .
As a UK Member of this Parliament I understand other Members ' concerns .
This morning , and in recent days in particular , we have read and heard a lot of allegations .
Even today we have heard talk of James Bond , of American espionage and we have had the rantings of the madman to my left a few moments ago .
But today , and in the Citizens ' Rights Committee , we have had few real facts because of the secrecy .
That is , after all , the nature of intelligence and military information work .
If it was not secret and we all knew about it , it would not serve the purpose for which it would be intended and necessary .
Members will therefore understand that it is the practice in the United Kingdom Government , like , I imagine , most or all other governments , not to comment on alleged interception whether the allegations are based on trivia or something perhaps more substantial .
As Mr Liikanen has said , everything done in the United Kingdom is in line with a proper legal framework .
Everything is subject to close parliamentary scrutiny in the House of Commons .
We have very tight controls , both independent controls and control that emanates from the Secretary of State with the full consent of the United Kingdom Government .
Finally and importantly , I want to reiterate that everything that has been conducted , or will be conducted , is in complete conformity with United Kingdom law , with United States law and , most importantly , is done with complete respect for , and in complete conformity with , the European Convention on Human Rights .
- I voted against the motion for a resolution because the reference in Article 1 to 're-certified aircraft with low by-pass ratios ' would effectively put an end to a project to re-engine aircraft in an unemployment blackspot of West Wales which could potentially create 400 jobs .
This is because the engines which the company concerned plans to use have a by-pass ratio of less than three and so would be excluded from EU airspace under the Regulation as it stands .
Article 2( 2 ) excludes from the scope of the Regulation only aircraft which have been completely re-engined 'with engines having a by-pass ratio of three or more ' .
This is in spite of the fact that the engines in question would easily meet all noise and emissions standards .
Aircraft noise is not determined by engine by-pass ratio alone , and I believe that aircraft noise should be measured by the actual noise made during take-off , fly-past and landing as is the case under the Chicago Convention .
I abstained on the final vote on this report on the basis of my speech on Wednesday evening .
I am not in any way against the intentions or sentiments of the report but solely in respect of the action plan on Sri Lanka .
I believe that it is inadequate and that there is far too little attention paid to the need to seek a political solution in Sri Lanka .
It is all too apparent that we cannot rely on the Sri Lankan government to give independent access to politicians or journalists to the war zones , nor for impartial evidence on what is really happening regarding human rights abuses and allegations of torture and similar practices by , or with the tacit approval of , the Sri Lankan government .
The war in Sri Lanka , President , is one that neither side can win and unless and until there are peace negotiations there will always be applications for asylum seekers in the west , almost all of whom will be Tamils .
The European Parliament I believe has a role to play in arguing that the European Union must bring pressure to bear on the Sri Lankan government to seek peace .
Europe can be the peace intermediary to bring such a peaceful solution to the island of Sri Lanka and peace for the Tamil and Sinhalese communities and others in Sri Lanka .
- I wholeheartedly support Ewa Klamt ' s report on the fight against child exploitation .
The report focuses specifically on combating child sex tourism but , as we all know , the issue is much broader than this .
Clearly , with new technology and globalisation , child pornography on the Internet , in particular , is an ever-growing international problem .
Technology is proceeding faster than individual governments can legislate .
Europe can act by strengthening child protection legislation and ensuring adequate child protection , particularly in some of the applicant countries , such as Romania and Hungary .
At present , it seems that animals have more rights than children in Europe .
I believe we must be vigilant and ensure strong , effective measures are put in place to protect the rights of children in e-Europe .
Progress is , of course , being made .
