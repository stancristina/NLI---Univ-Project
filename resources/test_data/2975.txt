I should once again like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their contribution and for the excellent group effort , and I look forward to the debate .
I am , in fact , just as thrilled about it as she is .
The right incentives must be given to both the car sector and the fuel sector in order to truly achieve cleaner road transport and cleaner fuels .
What has been included , though , is a long-term goal of 95 g/km by 2020 , which I am pleased about , but it depends on the interpretation to what extent this has been included effectively in the current text .
The government , in turn , should support this switch far more resolutely , not least fiscally .
I argue in favour of full European harmonisation of deposit guarantee schemes .
It is , however , necessary to enshrine the measures implemented in relation to deposit guarantee schemes in one European directive .
These companies should continue to fall within the scope of the deposit guarantee scheme .
Amendment 4 to Mr Moreno SÃ¡nchez 's report receives my support .
Last week , we were embroiled in complex negotiations about new resolutions , but I am pleased that we all retraced our steps .
I also wanted to mention the penalties to you , in particular , Commissioner for Justice .
The fight against counterfeit goods should not only be waged on the negotiating table , but just as much on the ground .
In fact , this also applies to this dossier .
During that discussion , it was particularly Mr Lehne , who was shadow rapporteur for this report , who suggested that Member States should already be given the option of excluding micro-entities , the really small companies , from this European legislation at this stage .
I hope that this message struck home with the Commission too .
Everyone who opposes him serves , as before , the interests of other countries and at home only those of the privileged white majority .
We have now reached a stage further than during the previous urgent debates .
This is set to stay this way , as long as Russia has suddenly become rich and successful on the back of gas and oil exports .
The resolution is right to state that , in our contacts with Russia , human rights , the rule of law and democracy should receive priority . on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - ( NL ) Madam President , the debate about the sustainable use of plant protection products and their admission on the market is a particularly complex one .
Extra restrictions are now being imposed on the admission of products , and rightly so , but this will not harm agriculture to a disproportionate extent .
I should like to offer my sincere thanks to both rapporteurs for the cooperation and efforts in achieving this result . author . - ( NL ) Madam President , Commissioner , it is unfortunate that Mrs Kroes is prevented from being here this evening because of an accident .
Madam President , the Commission proposal reviewing the rules for public broadcasting is unacceptable as it currently stands .
This would give commercial channels considerable input .
Moreover , it is very much the question whether a prior assessment of the market impact and a public evaluation of the new services will not give commercial competitors too much of a head start .
After the hearing , the Director-General said that the Commission might have to draft a fresh version based on this new information , before it submits its final communication .
Thirdly , further to the comment by the Director-General for Competition , is the Commission prepared , based on the new information , to draw up a new proposal ?
It is expected that , as a result , viewers and listeners will feel more closely associated , new target groups will be reached and government costs will be limited .
Moreover , this is a matter that falls within the competence of the Member States , not that of the European Union .
The specific proposals in my report are as follows .
On account of its strategic location , that region could well play a significant role in the transit of crude oil and natural gas .
In short , I may be concluding this report this evening , but the work is not done by a long shot , not for me and not for the European institutions .
Let it be clear , though , that all those countries have a future in the EU and that their membership will ensure that the dreadful conflicts which have typified that region for centuries are now a thing of the past .
If it is dialogue with the citizen that Europe is after , then it should start respecting democracy .
It is perfectly possible for Member States not to be too ambitious , which can lead to too much reserve .
Derogation options were expressly created for 12 substances .
Commissioner Verheugen has rightly raised the fact that a number of amendments to the legislation are necessary .
The same applies to antidepressants and other drugs which have an impact on people 's mental health .
I imagine that that might very well be the case , but independent testing is crucial here , too .
The industry has a responsibility , patients have a certain amount of responsibility , but so do the authorities as well . on behalf of the IND/DEM Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , Palestine is Islamic territory , inalienably so .
This overconfident prognosis is now costing Mr Lukashenko dearly at the beginning of 2009 .
The European Union should use a balanced strategy to
