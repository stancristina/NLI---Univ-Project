the United States ( 2.7 % ) and in Japan ( 3 % ) , and reveals significant discrepancies within the Union itself .
As to public service , or even services of general interest , there is hardly a word , apart from some concern about citizens with disabilities .
First of all , with regard to extending the measures adopted under the IMO on domestic shipping and the relevant port facilities , I wish to highlight the need for setting a timetable that is sufficiently long to enable the countries concerned to comply with the rules laid down .
We cannot , therefore , support the text that has been proposed since , in addition to its emphasis on liberalisation , its position on the issues of self-handling and pilotage is far removed from that advocated by Parliament .
This means that pilotage might also be undertaken on a self-handling basis , with the potential consequences for maritime and environmental safety that this entails , and this is something we cannot accept .
This might involve regulating access to the European Union by establishing protective entry schemes and resettlement programmes .
The Italian presidency intends that the November Justice and Home Affairs Council should adopt Council guidelines based on the conclusions of the Rome seminar , in order to provide the Commission with the necessary political guidance to prepare the report we shall be producing next June .
I hope that in the June 2004 report I will be able to put forward concrete proposals in this respect .     Mr President , Commissioner , I wish to take this opportunity provided by the Rules of Procedure to ask precisely the questions that I tabled previously .
There are now areas of considerable concern , for example , it has been said that the aim of this reform is to bring Europe closer to the peoples and the citizens but the outcome that has been announced means the end of the rotating presidencies , without providing any satisfactory alternative .
We support the report 's call to Member States to adopt specific legislation that bans genital mutilation , but we would draw attention to the need for an active policy for the social inclusion of these communities , particularly in the fields of housing , health , education and training .
Member States will only be able to adopt specific provisions on ports that only occasionally serve international traffic , although provision is made for a possible exemption from the obligation of security checks prior to entry into a port for ships engaged on a scheduled service within a Member State or between two or more Member States , and these must adopt a national plan to implement the provisions of the regulation .
I voted in favour .     I voted in favour of this proposal .
I also believe that this Agency must be designed to actively seek solutions to the problems arising from cyber crime , which means , of course , looking very closely at the particular situation of risk and greater exposure with which our children are confronted .     Around one in every four Europeans ( totalling approximately one million per year ) will fall victim to cancer .
In this context , my vote was not only favourable but also enthusiastic , hoping that this recommendation will be adopted because , although it is not legally binding , it is a real political priority .     I roundly congratulate Mr Mussa on his excellent report on an issue that is a matter of grave concern to us – cancer and its early detection .
I also welcome the very clear commitment to promoting an aware and unafraid attitude to screening programmes , and also the commitment to the information campaign designed to teach people how to diagnose themselves .     This proposal for a regulation seeks to provide a response , in the current framework , to the need to record and trace the movements of sheep and goats in order to improve identification of affected animals in the event of an epidemic .
Only in this way can we avoid seeing the number of producers leaving the sector increase .     The proposal for a regulation sets out a system of individual and batch identification and for the species in question , providing an opportunity for using electronic identification .
Progress has been made on drawing up waste management plans , although some countries do not have such plans or are not implementing them , and consequently various legal proceedings have been opened as a result of failure to comply with the directive .
To this end , regulations for control must also be established , depending on the type of waste transported and on the way in which it will be processed at its destination .
By not respecting this guideline , the Commission proposal clearly breaches the principle of subsidiarity and I therefore voted against it .
By the same token , although there is a need to produce what is being called a ‘scientific soil catalogue ’ – a need that has been felt by the various researchers and specialists in this area for a long time – and this must be supported , the proposed timetable nevertheless appears to be very limited .
The environment recognises no borders and concerns everyone .
We will not , therefore , have all the elements we need objectively to evaluate the ‘relative’ dimension of waste treatment in the European Union .     .
I believe that Parliament would do well to acknowledge that defence is an enormously sensitive field in political terms and currently falls directly within the competence of the Member States .
Increasing the Union’s military capability does not , however , mean that we need , straightaway , to create new structures and devote more financial resources to developing this policy in practice
