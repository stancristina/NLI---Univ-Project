Lastly , Mr President , the Group of the European People ' s Party supports the compromise amendment that we have reached with Mrs Roure on lawyers ' activities .
The area of security is much more developed , with the growth of Europol over the years , to which we have today added the fight against organised crime ; but this is the repressive function of the State .
This idea comes across quite clearly in the Gebhardt report .
Countries must not exclude cooperation within the European Union by invoking reasons of State ; they will have to treat each other equally .
But there was a third speech , by Mr Galeote Quecedo , which does not feature in the Minutes .
I would like to remind you that the first time that the declaration of rights was discussed was at the Congress of Europe in The Hague in 1948 , and that was the origin of the European Convention on Human Rights of the Council of Europe .
I have had the opportunity to express my admiration for the work carried out by Íñigo Méndez de Vigo , as chairman of the European Parliament delegation .
The Charter provides the Union with an essential legitimacy as a community of values , and we need to emphasise this , because we have also experienced events that show that Article 7 needs to have a much more solid support .
After Nice we will be able to start talking about the European constitution .
Thirdly , Mr President , and surely this is the most important reason , because a Charter of Fundamental Rights is going to increase the feeling of belonging to the European Union .
I think that there is a false debate .
The fundamental issue of Turkey ' s accession continues to be a political issue and it is the responsibility of other parliamentary committees .
Let us hope that it leads to tripartite dialogue and conciliation .
This shows , once again , that the Member States have a long way to go in understanding the meaning of shared sovereignty .
However , I would like to draw your attention to the possible reforms of criminal law that could take place in various Member States such as Spain , for example , with the Partido Popular in power - which is taking advantage of a certain situation - because these reforms are still a concern for the Europe of freedom and democracy .
We have to be generous towards the Mediterranean , but from a selfish point of view , which is to safeguard the stability that we need so much for the people of the European Union , and for European society .
It is continuity over time that can provide results , and positive results will be ultimately measured by the development of the countries of the southern Mediterranean .
We probably need to open up a more medium-term perspective and I can only list the three areas that I feel are essential in that respect : The first is European projects to structure a regional area in the southern countries .
The Commission and the Council need to urgently undertake what was agreed in Feira and they need to make a common policy for the development of the Mediterranean region viable .
The European Union needs a new culture of immigration and a better management of migration flows .
Therefore , we cannot just talk about products and the organisation of markets without thinking about those citizens .
So much so that when I was in Bosnia-Herzegovina and visited a village , they would greet me jubilantly with 'It is so good that you Americans are here to help us . '
We must also highlight the media .
It is also essential to strengthen the role of the European Parliament , and I believe that with the amendments , which are likely to be voted for tomorrow , the European Parliament will be able to perform a greater consultative role in a process of interinstitutional collaboration .
What would be the features of this new Fisheries Agreement ?
He is less likely to succeed in something which is purely Mediterranean , than Pitres , a village up in the Alpujarra mountains in Granada , is in getting its own port , or even the expansion of its port .
Allow me to say that the political will shown in practice - not in theory - by the Community negotiators has been absolutely nil , or in any case inadequate .
This approach is necessary but inadequate , since the European Union needs to adopt clear , uniform and homogeneous guidelines for its participation in the regional fisheries organisations .
The administration of monitoring and , progressively , its actual execution must therefore be assigned to the Commission , and hence the cost of this must be borne by the Community budget .
This means that the Community 's role as a contracting party would be reduced to a mere façade .
Very good intentions which can only become reality if there is a genuine political desire .
Similarly , the Commission has the obligation not only to properly represent us in the international maritime sphere but also to take the initiative .
When we say more organisations , we mean those that can and should be set up in the South Atlantic or South Pacific - as has already been said here - and for the Commission to take a leading role in them .
We shall do so together with the fishing sector so that we can form a common , joint opinion Then you will have to return to the parliamentary committee for the Commission to report back to us .
The Commission accepts that the only two ways to support the market - private storage and refunds - are insufficient to stave off the crisis , and yet it makes this timid
