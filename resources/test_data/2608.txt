Aside from our amendments on the representative nature of the chosen local representatives in the decision-making on compensation , our requests for a separate vote are aimed at restoring to some extent the purpose of the initial proposal and thus opening the way to the creation of a supplementary compensation fund at Community level .

The Air France group has , for example , just announced a gross operating surplus of FRF 10 billion , or approximately FRF 200 000 per company employee , and , in spite of the substantial increase in the price of kerosene , the company has just increased its shareholder dividends by 57 % this year .
