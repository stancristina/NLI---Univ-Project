I am therefore very aware of these problems , and I can assure Mr Medina Ortega that we are very active in this field .
I travelled to Athens to discuss problems - specific problems - with what is known as the Dublin II agreement , which determines which country should take responsibility for handling an asylum application .
I am probably going to Rome next weekend to discuss the same problems .
Of course , this will have to be discussed .
There are several ways of doing this , and it is those I am discussing with the relevant governments .
We have started with the most difficult problems of all , with a view to getting those out of the way , in order that we can not merely realise the wish expressed in the Seville conclusions for the completion of the Dublin system , but also make the best possible progress with the common asylum rules .
We intend to make the best progress we possibly can with the work , and if possible complete it in November .
The negotiations on the Multilateral Nuclear Environmental Programme in the Russian Federation ( MNEPR ) have been going on for more than three years .
It is true that the common will to conclude the negotiations was not formally expressed in the joint statement from the summit in Moscow on 29 May , but the question was discussed at the summit , and Russia expressed a desire for resolution of the outstanding issues , which are of course taxation and civil liability .
The EU has taken every opportunity to put pressure on Russia to break the deadlock , including at the meetings of the Cooperation Council .
The other partner countries , the USA and Norway , have also put her under intense pressure .
The inaugural pledging conference for the Support Fund of the Northern Dimension Environmental Partnership ( NDEP ) was concluded with a positive result on 9 July of this year in Brussels .
Participants in the conference emphasised that the conclusion of this MNEPR agreement is a necessary precondition for projects within the nuclear sphere entering into operation within the framework of the NDEP.
The nuclear-safety issue is of decisive importance for environmental protection on the continent of Europe .
The Danish Presidency therefore wishes to work towards bringing the negotiations on the MNEPR agreement to a conclusion by the end of this year .
Without commenting on what was said about Russia 's strategy , I can at least guarantee that we shall not miss an opportunity to put pressure on Russia , as I have said .
I have just attended a Ministerial Conference in Greenland in which the Russians also participated .
The subject matter was the Northern Dimension , in which I know that Mrs Thors also has a great interest .
I am thinking of Kaliningrad , of the enlargement of NATO and the EU and of the environmental problems in the Murmansk area , which Mrs Thors knows more about than I do .
I do not mean that there is a set of rules in the archives , but I prefer not to improvise , as this is outside the scope of the question .
This is Question No 15 by Mr Fitzsimons .
The question was from Mr Crowley .
The cornerstone of the Presidency 's drugs programme is the mid-term review of the EU action plan to combat drugs for 2000-2004 .
The Commission will draw up an evaluation report to be submitted to the European Council at the meeting in Copenhagen in December .
The Danish Presidency intends to monitor closely the preparation of the Commission 's report to ensure that the relevant working parties in the Council contribute to the greatest possible extent so that the report is comprehensive and informative .
It has presented initiatives on the treatment of criminal drug abusers whilst they are in jail , and on synthetic drugs : the generic classification .
At international level , meetings will be held with the candidate countries , the USA , Russia and the Association of South-East Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) ; and , as far as Latin America is concerned , meetings will be held in preparation for the event to be held during the Greek Presidency .
The issue of cocaine will be discussed at meetings with the USA and with parties in Latin America .
I can only say that we shall do what we can because , and I repeat , we consider this a particularly important area .
We could talk long and hard about this subject , that is , how alternatives - alternative substances in some cases - can be used to help these young people out of their abuse pattern at the earliest opportunity .
This is a matter which , I believe , concerns the national parliaments in all of our Member States , and it also concerns the Danish Presidency .
I cannot say that the question will become a central one , as it is first and foremost the responsibility of national , and often even local , authorities to guarantee these therapies , but I can say that I agree that this is a core problem .
At the same time , there is a difficulty with giving them substances to help them out , as this can also cause them to become dependent in some other way .
We all recall that the EU , directly after the sentence was passed , made a declaration calling upon the relevant authorities to take the necessary measures to have the sentences reviewed and ensure that the fundamental rights of the accused were respected .
At that time , neither the government 's nor the opposition 's explanation could be confirmed .
Against this background , the Council does
