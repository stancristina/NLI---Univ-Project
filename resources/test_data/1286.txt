conflicts .
Once again , I wish to welcome Sweden as the country holding the presidency .
Many issues revolve around the three Es .
I know that you , Prime Minister , expressed your dismay after the awful tragedy last year when 58 Chinese people were found dead in a container in Dover .
Well , the development in Europe has taken a wrong turn .
These proposals must be stopped .
To impose a visa requirement on 130 countries is not worthy of a democratic Europe .
This , Prime Minister , is an opportunity for the new presidency to make an important contribution towards humanity and human dignity in the spirit of Raoul Wallenberg , whose memory you have so commendably honoured .
Empathy is the key word .
I hope it means that the EU will take several steps forward and that it will also reinforce the image of the EU in Sweden .
Parliament will be adopting positions on some eighty food safety directives .
Such an overall solution requires more than the proposed food authority .
Expectations are high in view of the statement of Mr Persson , the President-in-Office of the Council , to the effect that sustainable development on the EU' s agenda will lead to a green strategy for the 21st century .
Another question of great immediate interest is how the Swedish Presidency is planning to assume the task - which it has inherited from Nice - of formulating a strategy for the political future of the EU.
Finally , I would like to congratulate the Swedish Presidency .
Instead , I will concentrate on the major European issues .
In that way , a European political space can be created for conducting a debate , which in turn is the prerequisite for building institutions which will go on to create increased democratic legitimacy .
This is something which I - which we - wish to see , but we are not going to give that indication .
Such a breakthrough can take place during the Swedish Presidency and we may then very well be able to specify a date in Gothenburg .
I hope that this will be the case .
There is no firmer support for enlargement than that offered by the European Parliament .
I hope we can resolve the differences on factual matters which exist between the Commission , the Council and Parliament so that we can make some progress on the issue of enlargement .
I attach great value to the statements of Mrs Hautala and others .
I am also convinced that we , in practice , already have the technology .
I therefore believe that the Gothenburg Summit will be an important point of departure , enabling us to show that there is a path to success whereby new technology , research , development and faith in human ability are in actual fact promoted through political investment .
We ought to be able to adopt that approach alongside the creditable work Commissioner Wallstr√∂m is doing with her environmental care programme for issues relating to chemicals and the way in which the use of these is regulated .
In the open coordination which is a feature of the Lisbon process , we have found a way of jointly pursuing the development of employment in the Union .
An isolated country is vulnerable , but not so a union of countries .
After all , the work which forms the core of the European Union has to do with the internal market and that method of working in terms of community legislation that is in the spirit of Monnet .
Irrespective of which form of cooperation we choose , the same requirements for openness and transparency apply .
What Mr Olsson says about food policy , food quality , the interest of consumers in their right to protection and the renewal of consumer confidence is very much in line with my own thinking regarding the presidency ' s approach .
Mr Olle Schmidt talked about policy on refugees and about a generous attitude on the part of the European Union towards those who turn to us in search of safety and protection .
Together , not individually .
We will also be happy to receive you as guests in our somewhat cold and distant country , a country which , however , will be full of warmth and fellowship on such occasions .
The interesting contribution by Commissioner Prodi confirmed the challenges we face .
The Swedish Government has stated that it wants to see such a charge , but only if a unanimous decision on this can be reached which , however , is the same thing as no decision at all .
Furthermore , the strategy for sustainable development , which is going to be taken up for discussion in Gothenburg , will be severely compromised if the EU does not take a coordinated grip on these energy issues .
Reference has been made here today to the Tobin tax , but I think that this will be impossible to implement .
There are plans for further meetings of the same nature , and the next one will be held in Beijing in a few weeks ' time .
The French Presidency responded to the urgent request by the European Council and put forward several initiatives as elements in the fight against the criminal networks which organise smuggling and trafficking in human beings .
The first step was an experts ' meeting at the end of November last year attended by experts in the field from both Asia and Europe .
The recommendations from this meeting will be presented at ASEM' s meeting of Foreign Ministers in Beijing in May of this year .
Tens of thousands of women and girls are bought and sold in China every year , many of them to the West .
