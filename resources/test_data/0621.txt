veritable disaster .
That was the latest at 17.53 hours .
The contribution under discussion , which would take the form of an EIB loan in excess of EUR 250 million for the period from 2000 to 2007 , may not prove to be a milestone , but it would certainly help the process on its way .
It is therefore not quite accurate for the report to talk in terms of democratisation .
We must immediately appeal to the military and the police , in no uncertain terms , to throw their full weight behind democracy , and do all they can to ensure that this changeover of power - which was triggered by the outcome of democratic elections - proceeds peacefully over the next few hours .
Croatia and the region deserve this in the interests of peace within Europe .
I therefore support Mr Lannoye ' s amendment .
We urge the Commission to clarify its position .
But it lacks substance to some extent .
Problems to do with access to social security must be looked at on a case-by-case basis to this end .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe we are now discussing Commissioner Diamantopoulou ' s second tour de force .
This is where Europe will again lead the way in the fight for women ' s rights in Europe .
To sum up , what we need is to strike a balance between competition rules and acting for the public good .
The Community ' s competition policy has been given a new European and international dimension .
Thirdly therefore , I would like to congratulate the Commission and its staff on the actions and decisions they have taken in the field of competition law , previously under Karel van Miert and now under your overall control , Professor Monti .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am grateful for the fact that we are , after all , to have the opportunity to discuss the proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 68/193/EEC on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine , and I also hope that tomorrow ' s vote will have a positive outcome .
Accompanying paperwork and controls are important , and the Commission must ensure that only one document is required for each party , wherever they happen to be in Europe .
But in all fairness , it has to be said that no one is forced to use genetically modified material .
As far as we are concerned , the key criteria for judging the success of the Intergovernmental Conference are whether majority decision-making is to become the fundamental decision-making principle in future , and whether the European Parliament is to be accorded the status of co-legislator in all such matters .
No, we do not want specially tailored measures for foreign trade policy because this is a key aspect of Community policy , with all that foreign trade policy issues imply , and I would urge you to see to it that the French Presidency makes foreign trade policy a key aspect , in fact the key aspect of Community policy .
Similarly , the stock phrase used by the French , that it is better to have no treaty than a bad one , is unlikely to reinforce anyone ' s faith in the attainability of an ambitious goal in Nice .
At the very least , it must be possible to agree on the detail of a common position on these matters in Nice .
The Commission , having the option of simple majority voting , would be better equipped to provide this impetus in the future .
It is therefore ironic that the Heads of State and Government should be the ones making the decisions about the fundamental rights of the citizens of Europe .
Unfortunately , none of this has changed yet .
It is not the name though , but the practical form it takes , that will decide whether it will serve the interests of the European Union .
Both reports leave some questions open , i .e . the answers given are only of a provisional nature .
So here we are in October 2000 , with only a short while to go before the financial framework for Budget 2001 is agreed .
However , we sometimes asked ourselves during the discussions , how the Council could justify its vote , for example with regard to heading 1 .
Above all , we want to equip them to make use of the new technologies .
For more than a year now , Parliament has been urging the Council to work with it on negotiating stable and secure reconstruction aid for the Balkans .
Parliament ' s preferred approach is twofold .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the budgets of the European Parliament , the Council , the Court of Justice , the Economic and Social Committee , the Committee of the Regions and the Ombudsman , are purely administrative budgets .
Also , in light of the fact that Parliament now has a transparent promotion system , which rewards on the basis of merit and not just according to length of service in a post , we approved all the announced promotions .
The biggest problem we face at the moment is the hold-ups that have occurred within the translation service of the European Court of Justice .
That being the case , I believe we will be in a position to approve the necessary promotions within the Committee of the Regions .
It is the situation with regard to administrative expenditure that we are most concerned about .
This seems odd to us because there will still be an operational budget in the second part of 2002 , and so we are calling for a review of the relationship between redeployment aid and social aid
