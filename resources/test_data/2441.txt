I come to the committee meeting here I shall certainly be once more engaged in the same discussion .
The Commission expressed the same position in the General Affairs Council .
The General Affairs Council made a unanimous decision , which you are aware of , and which I mentioned in my speech .
Accordingly , the headquarters will be in Thessaloniki .
As far as I am aware , we have a tradition that when the Heads of our Governments and States come to a decision on an issue at a summit , be it a regular or extraordinary meeting , we strive in the General Affairs Council to find a way of implementing that decision .
In every respect I agree that we have to avoid excessive bureaucracy .
As for the other matters , I would just like to say briefly that despite all the help we shall give the region , ultimately the responsibility obviously lies with the people there themselves .
We will only be providing them with support .
For this reason , we have looked at great length into ways of helping Serbia to achieve democracy as quickly as possible .
The war is behind us , but the peace has to be built .
But Finland respects the choice of those eleven EU Member States who do belong to NATO .
In my opinion , we should all share in the task of ensuring that the Balkan region is secure .
But as I said before , for this we need a non-military option in addition to the military one .
Denmark was the country to make the proposal , but Finland is the country which , as holder of the Presidency , will promote this worthy initiative as vigorously as possible in co-operation with others .
We believe this policy is a coherent one .
The Tampere meeting will be preceded by an independent meeting of non-Governmental organisations , and we , for our part , wish to offer them our support , while obviously respecting their independent status .
The rights of minorities are a weak area in established democracies also , whatever aspect of minorities they are concerned with .
I wish to call attention to the fact that there is often room for improvement in all our countries when it comes to the status of ethnic minorities .
I have been in touch with the foreign ministry in Slovakia , one of the applicant countries , and we have begun talks on how the issue may be solved from their point of view .
I spoke of it in my speech , and the Kurdish question will most certainly be a subject for debate here very often in the future , when we shall strive to find a way to improve the situation .
But I would like to assure you of two things .
However , in our opinion , enlargement is a special issue , and we will do everything within our power in the area of institutional reform to move it along .
Institutional reforms must be introduced in such a way that the Union can live with them even when the number of Member States has exceeded twenty .
That gives me hope .
Issues of youth can be successfully dealt with by means of mainstreaming , just as effectively as , for example , issues of gender equality , aged people , as has been touched upon here , and other such matters .
As a representative of the country that now holds the Presidency , I shall be personally present at the part-session in September .
I really appreciate having the opportunity to work together with you all .
The Council immediately looked into the matter , deciding on 9 July to take the case to the European Court of Justice , on the basis of Article 213 ( 2( 3 ) ) of the EC Treaty and the regulations contained in the ECSC Treaty and the Euratom Treaty .
The Council believes he was under an obligation to decline Telef√≥nica 's offer .
It is the common objective of the Council , the future President of the Commission , Romano Prodi , and all the candidates for membership of the Commission to prevent the repetition in future of similar conflicts of interest , such as that which occurred in the Bangemann case .
For example , there will be clear rules for new Members regarding what sort of posts would be appropriate for them to take up on departure from the Commission .
Members of the Commission must also , if requested , allow an independent ethics committee to investigate any future post up to a year after they have ceased to hold office , to ensure the new job is compatible in its nature with the work of the Commission .
Besides the Members of the Commission , all others in the service of the institutions of the Union must be able to demonstrate that they are adhering to the principle of transparency and complying with commonly accepted rules of behaviour .
Only credible reforms will bring the Commission and the Union as a whole closer to the public and increase the confidence of our citizens in the Union and its institutions .
The reform process has been initiated in all institutions , which is due , amongst others , to the European Parliament , which on various occasions has drawn attention to these problems .
He was a determined and skilful Member of the Commission , a bit like a steam train , and occasionally in debates he would slap us MEPs like cod on a jetty , but what of that ?
The impartial nature of our administration is the most important issue for all of us here and in the Commission .
That was seen in the elections and in the campaigning
