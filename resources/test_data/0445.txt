- or rather absolutely - committed to the Social Agenda as adopted in Nice on the basis of the Agenda agreed in 2000 .
This always creates problems , which we are trying to resolve .
Secondly , it must refer back to the wider review of the factors involved and look forward to future expectations , these factors being , of course , the social partners , together with women 's organisations and civic society organisations , as described by the honourable Members .
Ladies and Gentlemen , I am positive that this report and the close collaboration with the committee in question will help to improve consistently the performance of the Social Agenda which , I would again remind the House , is a completely new tool and which close cooperation will help to make even better .
Apart from the fact that it is much more accurate than the American Global Positioning System ( GPS) , which has been up and running for several years now , the main point about GALILEO is that , unlike the GPS , it is to come under political , rather than military control .
However , the European Parliament approved two amendments by a large majority , led mainly by the European People 's Party , with the backing of the Party of European Socialists , which seek to militarise the system by making express reference to military use of the system for so-called "peacekeeping operations " .
These developments prove that the global grass-roots movement needs to step up its fight against imperialist aggression and the militarisation of space .
( EL ) The European Parliament resolution on the Middle East may ascribe some responsibility to the Israeli government , but it remains faithful to the general policy of sitting squarely on the fence , which is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece abstained from the vote .
We welcome the fight by the Palestinian people for a fair and peaceful solution in accordance with UN resolutions and we stand by them in their struggle to found their own independent state around the capital of East Jerusalem .
On the contrary , by promoting the new order together with the USA and keeping to its tactic of sitting firmly on the fence between the murderers and the victims it is perpetuating the problem so that it can turn it to its advantage in accordance with its imperialist interests in the region and beyond .
We call on the governments of the Member States , especially of the countries represented at the UN Security Council , and the Ã…U to raise the issue of increased tension in the Middle East , the failure to apply the UN resolutions already passed and their violation by Israel at the UN and to call on Israel to help find a fair and viable solution to the problem and recognise the right of the Palestinian people to an independent state , which will make a decisive contribution towards stability and security in the region .
( EL ) The proposed resolution by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is a move in the right direction , which is why I support it .
Mr President , recently , at the beginning of last month , we faced the unforeseen possibility of a heated exchange between India and Pakistan .
In this sense , the purpose of our debate here today is to remind both countries , both India and Pakistan , of their responsibilities towards their people and the neighbouring region .
On the contrary .
In this sense , I believe that today 's resolution and unanimous support for it from all sides of the House will make both a symbolic and a substantial contribution .
The Members of the House have stressed that what happened was an exceptionally serious terrorist attack against the supreme institution of greater global democracy .
India is asking for Pakistan to take specific action to demonstrate that it is determined to stamp out all forms of terrorism , a perfectly legitimate request .
The Commission will continue to draw both sides ' attention to the need to cooperate rather than take the military option .
Madam President , military manoeuvres and Guantanamo analyses aside , mankind is on trial now , as are our willingness and ability to sustain a world in which the rules of law agreed a priori will prevail , because only then will we retain the moral and political right to judge everyone else who is indifferent to or tramples international rules of law underfoot , be they terrorists , the Taliban , anyone at all .
Those with the fastest guns and the slowest reflexes to ideals and institutions cannot take the law into their own hands .
It is for the same reasons that we are calling for the prisoners at Guantanamo to be treated as required under current international law or even American law , which cannot of course be limited to members of the Taliban who are American nationals .
We see them imposing embargos on Iraq , where they have killed thousands of children .
Mistreating prisoners of war is an even more serious violation of international law .
And let there be an end to the discussion as to whether or not the detainees in Guantanamo are prisoners of war .
And they have been transferred to occupied territory on the island of Cuba on purpose , as a serious provocation to the heroic people of Cuba .
The people will see to that .
The Commission will not be able to send observers for the second round of voting on 24 February because Madagascar was not on the Commission 's list of priorities for 2002 , including for reasons which originate in the country itself .
Mr President , the European Commission agrees with Parliament that priority must be given to supporting basic democratic institutions in Cambodia .
