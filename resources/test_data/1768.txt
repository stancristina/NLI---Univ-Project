again !
This is partly the work of human hand , as difficult as it is to demonstrate climate change using calculations .
I am therefore very proud to say that the skilled Austrian forestry workers are also prepared .....
You are unclear about this in your White Paper .
The Tibet Intergroup is very concerned about the worsening situation in Tibet and it is clear that the current policy of the European Union has proved inadequate to address the grave human rights abuses faced by Tibetans daily in Tibet .
Question No 34 by (H-0831/99 ) : Subject : Aid for Central Asia What development aid and what humanitarian aid does the Commission grant to the countries of Central Asia , and what is its assessment of the impact of this aid ?
Announcements and declarations of intent are one thing , fulfilling promises quite another .
Anyone , however , who believes that , regardless of the fact that discharge was refused for 1996 , the discharge for 1997 will make everything rosy in the garden again , is very much mistaken !
The general public knows that the European Parliament is not treating the discharge procedure as a routine matter but is giving it every attention , and the Commission has also been aware of this since last year , when discharge was denied , which is what led to the resignation of the previous Commission .
This global approach is part of the reform package .
As far as the issues surrounding the Gaza hospital and the Palestinian Parliament are concerned , I am able to tell you that the Gaza hospital will be open and available to out-patients as of 15 July and to in-patients from 15 October 2000 .
We do not want financial control to be abolished .
What I do not understand is why this has to come at a price , as it were , that is , of having to dispense with independent - and I stress , independent - prior approval .
Indeed , the new Commission has now declared itself in favour of follow-up checks having this independence , and so would it not make sense for a system of prior approval to enjoy such independence as well ?
I believe , Mr Kinnock , that notwithstanding all the success achieved on a personal level , the Commission still has quite a lot to do to satisfy our justifiably high expectations .
You know that you will always have our support here in Parliament , and that includes your proposal , and we shall be behind you when the time comes to finance it .
The planned introduction of Eurojust is one of our significant successes from Tampere and must now be implemented forthwith .
The establishment of an area of freedom , security and justice hovers at the interface between the constituent elements of national sovereignty .
I say therefore that we need a timetable which stipulates what must be implemented , when and by whom .
We continue to demand a review of the agreement in order to incorporate better parliamentary and judicial control .
This is a perfect example of the sort of work we do not want to see .
In my view , and I say this quite clearly , the question is ideologically motivated rather than solution-focused .
If the knowledge of the facts and this debate and the arguments are as we say , and I think that they are right , then to take up another six months of the Commission ' s time and occasion uncertainty on the financial and capital markets would be irresponsible .
Madam President , we cannot just keep repeating the number which several previous speakers have quoted ; we must also mention the fact , Commissioner , that 80 % of these huge , daily foreign exchange sales have an investment term of no more than eight days .
We all know that !
The minimum requirements for this would be for a proper study to be carried out at long last , not only by the Commission , but by reputable economic institutes throughout Europe .
It is not your job , it is our job to decide on that .
( Applause ) The Christian Democrats , who form a key element of our group - and a great many people are probably unaware of this - evolved from the opposition to the totalitarianism of National Socialism , which was every bit as inhuman , but also to the totalitarianism of those despisers of mankind , the Communists .
We want a Europe that upholds the rule of law , a Europe that embraces peace and tolerance .
There is prejudice at work here , which - without going into our programme - is reducing the darkest hour of European history to a political spectacle .
The Austrian People ' s Party , which I represent here in this Parliament , used to be and still is a party that has consistently spoken up for the integration of my country into the EU and feels deeply attached to the community of values that is the European Union , and likewise its basic political principles of deepening and enlargement .
However , my criticism - and I freely admit this - my rage , is directed exclusively against those who have provoked these reactions and continue to do so , Messrs Schüssel and Haider and their parties , ...
Have you stopped to ask whether or not we will also be responsible for the way in which the political situation unfolds from now if we set ourselves up to pass judgement on it here ?
My next question , Mrs Wallström , is when will you begin to apply this principle to legislation ; to legislation pertaining to chemicals or other sectors , for example ?
