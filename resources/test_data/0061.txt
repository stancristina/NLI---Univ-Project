The fact that this is an explosive subject is something of which we have become aware in the course of the committee’s reading .
That is quite clear .
Allow me to say a word or two about the environmental aspect .
That is something we ourselves have acknowledged .
A premium must be placed upon environmental considerations .
The issue of tax on diesel fuel is also interesting .
The ELDR Group has tabled an amendment rejected by the committee .
If we can produce safer cars through favourable taxation , that is something it should be possible to experiment with .
The risk of social dumping between our countries will be much reduced , something that is incredibly important .
This must not , however , mean that we do not put forward proposals in new areas , for example in the area of the working environment in response , for example , to atypical jobs .
First of all , I naturally wish to congratulate the European Parliament , in particular the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities and also Mrs Dybkjær as rapporteur , for having taken the initiative regarding this report .
This too emphasises the importance of bringing about balanced representation for women and men in the decision-making process , especially in the run-up to the elections to the European Parliament next year .
Increased participation on the part of women also means better opportunities for society to take care of its citizens .
Unfortunately , it has so far been too often the case that men have been elected .
Balanced representation for women and men in the decision-making process and in all areas of life is also the central theme of the Commission ’s 2003-2004 Work Programme .
The preparations for publishing the initial results from this database are currently under way .
May I also mention the measures on decision-making which were recently adopted by the Italian Presidency with the support of the Commission and to which attention is drawn by the report .
These objectives are also among the tools and basic conditions that will enable women to participate in political life and the life of society generally .     Madam President , Mrs Dybkjær’s report deals with something of which all of us in this House have very long experience : actual life in the political organisations in which we participate .
When women enter politics , the organisation of political work changes , and new issues appear on the political agenda .
It is now also proposed to cut back on the areas of competence of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities .
I do in fact agree with the Council recommendation but , when the Council’s own composition throughout the years is examined in the form of photographs shown after the Council meetings , it is seen still to hark back to another era .     Madam President , firstly , I wish to thank you for this discussion , which really has illustrated the importance of the roles we all have to play .
In this area , there is , of course , also a very important role for the political parties , the European Parliament and the non-governmental organisations .
This is an issue that , for better or for worse , we shall have to live with for a long time to come , for we unfortunately live at a time when it is easier to split an atom than to overturn a prejudice .     We would defend subsidiarity and assert that the EU institutions should not interfere with the Member States’ electoral systems or the political parties ’ systems for establishing their electoral lists .
We have therefore chosen to vote against the own-initiative report by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities on ‘Election 2004 : How to ensure balanced representation of women and men’ .     .
It would therefore be a mistake to transfer EU funds from Asia to Latin America .
For these reasons , we have voted against Amendments 1 and 2 , to the effect that the regulation should be split into two regulations ; Amendments 18 , 56 and 97 concerning the creation of a Solidarity Fund for Latin America ; and Amendments 93 and 94 about transferring financial resources from Asia to Latin America .     Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , approximately two years ago , information was circulating to the effect that Roma women were being sterilised against their will in Eastern Europe , especially in Slovakia .
In March 2002 , I put a question about this to the Commission , which promised to follow up the matter and enquire of Slovakia whether proof had been found of such compulsory sterilisation really having taken place .
We cannot accept such things in a European Union .     Mr President , I should not wish the European Year of People with Disabilities and the parliament we had last week to be seen as the end , but rather the beginning , of something .
I share that view .
For example , one area of competence for the EU is people’s freedom of movement .
That must not be used as an excuse for not producing directives in other policy areas .
I shall conclude by mentioning two other important areas to which attention should be given over the next few years .
We must push our demand for majority decision-making when it comes to anti-discrimination .
Actual practice leaves a lot to be desired , however .
The equal value of every person must , then , also be the criterion for what needs to be done .
People with disabilities are still discriminated against .
What is at issue is being able to cope successfully in everyday life , faced with a lack of jobs and
