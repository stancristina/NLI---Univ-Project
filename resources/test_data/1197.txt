, is carried out by illegal workers .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to congratulate Mr Cottigny on his report .
We are all agreed on this .
What is more , there is already a European system that provides for the possibilities to retrain workers , in that the existing European structural funds give the Member States the financial leg room to ( re)train their people .
Some may say that this is too little too late .
I would like to ask the Commissioner why the Commission did not react any sooner .
Mr President , it is beyond dispute that the European arrest warrant is already paying off in many ways , but while it makes the extradition system more efficient , considerably quicker and also less arbitrary , it still has flaws .
If we were all agreed on the rights of suspects , then the signing of this agreement on procedural rights would , of course , be a mere formality , but that is not the case , because there are many major differences which result in national courts now trying to figure out the conditions under which people are allowed to be extradited .
Member States are therefore seizing every opportunity to apply the criterion of double criminality .
I was , in spite of myself , reminded of this when we started assessing the development of the European arrest warrant .
I am , then , very much in favour of the amendments that are before us , the majority of which aim to simplify procedures .
While it is important that the Commission should bear this in mind when it drafts the implementing rules , I hope , too , that the Council will accept that this is not just about large enterprises , and that smaller businesses and NGOs should also benefit from a reduction in the administrative burden imposed by Europe .     .
This sounds simple , but it is an unfortunate fact that it is not .
Many consumers wish to buy well-caught fish , but they do not know which of the fish is sustainable .
I cannot avoid the conclusion that Europe today is still far too much preoccupied with subsidies to the detriment of investment and innovation .
Could the Commissioner indicate what the Commission intends to do to avert this danger and implement the conclusions of the Kok report ?
We are familiar with the nature and extent of the challenge Europe is facing .
The internal market must become a reality , come what may .
There is work to be done .
Without internal reforms , it will be difficult to steer the accession of new Member States effectively .
As for Turkey , as far as we are concerned , we will continue on the chosen path .
It is not an alternative to the prospect of membership .
I have to say that my group and I were deeply disappointed , and extremely vexed frankly , to see that in the run-up to this debate , the media twisted the words in the report , the result running counter to a number of central points .
Let us stop creating ambiguity in this Chamber , but , above all , also outside of it .     .
Mr President , up until recently , a swift and extensive enlargement of the European Union was suggested as a tremendous step forward , and as something meriting universal support .
Other European states are being referred to the neighbourhood policy .
Do we not have anything to offer those countries in the western Balkans other than the invitation to form a common market in the territory of the former Yugoslavia and to adapt their government and their economy to our wishes without them being able to join before 2020 ?
An identical murder was attempted very recently in the town of Mersin and direct threats are against churches via the telephone or even in newspaper columns .
Torture is still rife , and based on Article 301 of the criminal law among others , the free expression of opinion and freedom of the press cannot be guaranteed .
The report is right to remind us that the Copenhagen criteria include our own absorption capacity .
I take the view that vagueness about eventual membership and a fleshing out of the criteria will only delay the process , because this vagueness would be used as an excuse , from which nobody stands to benefit .     Mr President , enlargements have been beneficial to the European Union ; not only the people of the newly admitted countries , but also , certainly , those in the others too , have done well out of them .
This report does not in any way detract from the rights of candidate countries that have this status at the moment , and I should like to make this quite clear .
I tend to say neither , but simply note that it is rather improbable that would happen .
We need a debate there , not only on shareholder democracy , which the and are preaching , but on other aspects too .
I would like to know if you can confirm that what you mean by that is that major producers will be required to relinquish their blocking capacity in distribution companies .
I have always been puzzled by the fact that Germany , rather than the Netherlands , is the largest producer of Edam cheese , and I believe that that state of affairs should change .
Whilst I can support the gist of the report , I should nevertheless like to make three observations .
Moreover , whilst the Commission is very strict on the applicants when they exceed deadlines , there are no repercussions when the Commission postpones a decision .
