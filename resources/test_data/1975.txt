being used in Kosovo , there was a cover-up and Mrs Wallström - I have the Minutes here - said in reply to a question that there was still no confirmation that depleted uranium was used in the conflict .
Thirdly : if we accept , and you Mr Solana accept , that this research is needed , in short , to uncover the truth , should the precautionary principle not apply ?
.
The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will never cease to condemn this EU policy , which aims to make third countries politically and economically dependent and suppress the grass-roots movement .
( EL ) The report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is a move in the right direction .
More funds are needed to set young farmers up and reverse the exodus towards the towns .
One important point not contained in the Agricultural Committee report is that young farmers need to be given a basis on which to develop alternative , organic , family holdings , given that over-intensive farming leads nowhere except to mad cows .
However , I must highlight one particular issue .
Similarly , the European Parliament called in resolution Á4-0018/99 (C-153/1-6-99 ) for the Commission to propose extending the exclusive fishing zone to 24 nautical miles in order to guarantee a suitable decentralisation policy and protection for the interests of coastal areas .
( EL ) Ôhe only purpose which the joint motion for a resolution on the " Balkan syndrome " serves is to cover up the criminal policy of NATO and the European Union which , on the pretext of defending human rights , invaded Yugoslavia , causing incalculable personal injury and material damage .
Of course , the European Parliament acted true to form , as the war criminal , the former Secretary-General of NATO and the current High Representative of the EU , Javier Solana , cynically pointed out in his intervention , because it was the European Parliament itself which insisted on military intervention in the Balkans , both in Bosnia and Kosovo .
The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the joint motion for a resolution and call on the people to organise and develop their own united resistance to , and launch their own counter-attack on , the barbaric new order .
The joint motion for a resolution under discussion does not completely cover the first objective , but it does have the merit of calling for a moratorium on the use of these weapons .
I shall return a blank ballot paper because the call for a moratorium on the use of depleted uranium may be a positive step in the right direction , not that this means that war , internationally illegal bombings and other similar , fruitless interventions will stop .
Resolution on Korea
I should like to ask the President-in-Office if , in the wake of this tragedy which we have watched unfold , with over 60 officially dead , with maltreatment , with people who may be in prison because they spoke in their mother tongue , with some 200 prisoners continuing their hunger strike , the Swedish Presidency will publicly take an initiative and demand explanations and undertakings from the Turkish Government and , likewise , if the Swedish Presidency will finally take an interest in securing the release of Leyla Zana , the MP awarded the Sakharov prize by this Parliament ;
It is as part of this endeavour that the excellent report by our fellow member , Mrs Hedkvist Petersen , on the Commission communication on the priorities in road safety defines the way forward .
In addition , modern technology can and should be used in order to put the measures decided into practice and to control the application of current provisions .
Finally , we call on the Commission not to "race " through cases such as today 's .
That is what road safety needs .
The European Union loses 4 people an hour .
And what is more , Greece is the only country in Europe in which , unfortunately , there has been no downward trend over the last ten years .
We , ladies and gentlemen , have a huge responsibility both here and in Brussels .
Mr President , I wonder if you have seen the exclusive report in today 's edition of Le Figaro .
The newspaper says that it has published the article in order to alert French public opinion to the immediate danger threatening it and it also states , by way of information , that emergency measures have been taken in Paris in order to deal with this immediate threat .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as you all know , respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of women is a very recent affair .
The need for women to be promoted in the decision-making process and for a balanced participation of women and men in the democratic institutions , reflecting the balance of the sexes in nature , is a sine qua non of democracy and peace and of the cohesion and competitiveness of the European Union .
Sweden , as you all know , has a cabinet of 10 male and 10 female ministers .
We need a new institutional and social framework which reflects all the changes that have taken place since , which guarantees equal opportunities and divides responsibilities fairly and evenly between the two sexes , so that any decisions taken reflect the wishes , values , priorities , interests and abilities of both sexes of the human race .
What is certain is that , once there is a critical mass of women in the decision-making process , priority issues relating to the quality of life , such as environmental protection , social policy and welfare , medical care , education , the fight against drugs and trafficking in human beings and the peaceful resolution of conflicts will emerge on the political agenda .
