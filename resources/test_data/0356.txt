For that reason the most important elements of this report are the need to have harmonisation of measurement and assessment methods across the whole of the European Union so we can talk in comparable terms about the problems .
We also need to build noise maps and measure the real problem in every locality to establish what can be done in each case and adopt local measures to do that and eventually , by a step-by-step approach , we can arrive at a real action programme which is cost-effective in the measures that we adopt and which achieves the solution that we are looking for , a genuine reduction in noise levels and consequent improvement in human health .
Some parts of the report propose too rapid and far too quick an approach to a problem which has not been properly and carefully assessed .
It seems to me , for example , that the setting of noise limits at this time is presumptive .
We need to assess exactly what measures can be taken at a local level and whether we need noise limits in future .
We will have to progress down that road but the present proposal by the rapporteur goes too far in that direction at the moment .
I would nevertheless commend the report and of course the Commission 's proposal to the House .
Mr President , I brought my carrots with me but wisely I did not , like Mrs Thyssen , attempt to eat them , although both would have passed the Lannoye test .
I never believed that my last speech in this House in the twentieth century would be about sodium alginates .
But I could have bet that it would be in reply to a debate initiated by Mr Lannoye because he is an indefatigable champion of the consumer in matters great and small .
In my humble opinion these matters are relatively small - perhaps as small as these pieces of carrot .
I confess that I have some personal doubts about the dangers of E-401 but the dangers are not really , in the end , what this is about .
Our food authority in the UK has argued at length to me that sodium alginate is harmless , permitted in the US and many countries , has been around since the 1930s and , as far as laxatives are concerned , has less effect than we would find in fruit or cereal fibre and infinitely less than you would get from a mouthful of seaweed in a Japanese restaurant .
So much for the scientific approach .
Why then do I support Mr Lannoye ?
And my comrades in the PSE Group will do the same .
For several reasons , and this is where he performs such a singular service in our debates .
Firstly , he says : " What is the consumer benefit ? "
We can see the manufacturer 's benefit that this piece of carrot stays orange and does not turn grey .
But what is the consumer benefit in that ?
Secondly , where is the preparedness of industry to come forward and accept that some of the many additives we have can be struck off ?
Nobody says that .
Nobody comes to tell us .
Until they do we should support Mr Lannoye and his amendments and wish him a happy New Year .
Mr President , No one is in any doubt about the importance of the precautionary principle and I warmly welcome both the Commission communication and Mr Patrie 's report .
In the Committee on Industry , we underlined the importance of having clarity on the modalities for the application of the principle .
So I am pleased to see that the final report reflects the need for further elaboration of the concept .
We also called for measures in the World Trade Organisation , perhaps a regulation , which would ensure that it is possible , in the context of the WTO , to invoke other obligations , such as those we have under multilateral environmental agreements , to extend the scope of the precautionary principle .
In that context it would be helpful if the Commission would confirm its position that withdrawing a product on the basis of process or production methods may indeed be a legitimate application of the principle .
It is a very positive sign that the Council text says that it considers that the WTO rules basically allow for account to be taken of the precautionary principle , and further that it calls on Member States and the Commission to ensure that , and I quote , " the precautionary principle is fully recognised in all trade fora to pursue that aim and ensure that it is taken into account at the same time , particularly at the World Trade Organisation " .
The idea of compatibility between a precautionary principle and the World Trade Organisation seems to be gaining ground and that is to be welcomed .
There are issues to be borne in mind to ensure that it works well .
We must ensure for example that the burden of defending precautionary measures , especially for developing countries , does not reduce their capacity to protect health and the environment through precautionary action .
Finally if the precautionary principle is to be applied effectively and credibly , it is vital to involve all key stakeholders , including representatives of civil society in the policy choices that surround its application .
Madam President , I wonder whether I could crave the indulgence of the House .
I have spoken to Mr Sterckx about Amendment No 60 and the block that relates to it , which is Nos 52 , 62 , 57 , 38 and 60 .
With the agreement of the rapporteur we would like to move my Amendment No
