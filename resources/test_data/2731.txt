We could also seek formulae so that we can connect to our own debates .
If am not mistaken , after a lively debate in Stockholm , the COSAC last week expressed its support for the convention .
Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo , this report gives hope to many of us .
Today more than ever it is essential that we opt for a bigger and better Europe , for a more political Europe with more European policies , for an enlarged federal political Union which is more democratic and efficient .
Therefore , agriculture is still receiving discriminatory treatment in comparison with fields connected to it such as public health , consumer protection or the internal market .
Mr President , how can we preserve our resources and improve environmental health and social well-being in a balanced manner , without affecting any of the three pillars of sustainable development ?
Lastly , I think it is essential , in order to successfully bring the process of change to a conclusion , to enjoy a broad social consensus which includes commitments with social operators and the gradual but firm replacement - of course - of the social values of the old order - based on the possession and accumulation of goods - with other values of a society which is ethically and civically more advanced , based on the enjoyment of the less materialistic aspects of life .
We need more sustainable models of production and consumption .
The first fundamental issue is therefore compliance with environmental legislation .
We must find a method for complying with it .
We as a group have always supported the Commission because we have believed that this was a great project .
Therefore , we have wanted to strengthen and extend it , thereby showing that our group has a great interest in this policy .
We support the Commission .
In any event , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , Madam President-in-Office of the Council , I believe that we should be pleased , firstly because we are dealing with the first broad legislative proposal on the financial regulation of the Union , which runs in partnership with the administrative reform of management and human resources procedures and which must be the undeniable political objectives of Parliament and the Commission .
Throughout these recent years , we have not been able to harmonise the multi-coloured situation of public contracts .
I must say , ladies and gentlemen , that if you visit any retailer you will see that practically all child restraint systems currently on the market already comply with the legislation in force .
Our reason for not accepting it is that it would require manufacturers of vehicles to indicate which child restraint systems are suitable for their vehicles and can be easily installed in them .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I have summed up the Commission ' s position in relation to the report .
In almost all the Member States , unemployment rates are higher for women than for men .
Once the day comes when these objectives have been achieved , the other inequalities will also have disappeared .
Mr President , Commissioner , we have here today a proposal to amend the directive on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment , vocational training and promotion and working conditions .
The directive will help solve these problems , but it is the Member States , through their national legislation , which ultimately need to ensure that women can work full-time without their personal or family lives being badly affected as a result .
From the start , the European Community has aimed to eradicate unequal treatment , but unfortunately today there are still blatant inequalities in this area on which I will not expand either .
This meant that the political framework of the old kingdoms , counties , dukedoms and domains which , until then , had structured societies were small and useless .
Of course , I defend the Brussels Declaration signed on Monday of this week by seven constitutional regions , of which Catalonia is one , and we need to ensure that the European regions with legislative powers participate in a very prominent way not only in the preparatory debate , first in Laeken and then at the IGC in 2004 , but also in the decision-making processes on the policies of the Union .
But aside from this , the report contains some aspects , above all regarding the need to use a method similar to the Convention that drew up the Charter of Fundamental Rights and also the need to begin a constitutional process culminating in the adoption of the European Union Constitution , which made me inclined to vote in favour of it , despite my conviction that Nice was a wasted opportunity .
The level has been raised so high that it is impossible even for the enlargement countries to achieve it .
Mr President , I am pleased to have this opportunity to congratulate the excellent work done by Mrs Hautala .
Mr Verhosfstadt , as a senator in the Kingdom of Belgium , was the rapporteur for the committee which studied Belgium ' s responsibilities in the case of Rwanda .
We do not wish to be aware of it , but we only have to look at what is happening with prostitution in our countries to see what is going on .
It must also be pointed out that the problem of the illegal trafficking in cultural goods and its impunity are more serious than ever .
We can , however , draw certain conclusions .
For all these reasons , our report expresses the view that it is crucial that legislation is improved and that a qualitative change is made to the Community ' s approach .
Through this report ,
