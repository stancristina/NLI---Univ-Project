or non-uniform transposition of the framework decision into the national laws of the Member States and the categories of offences whose criminality is not checked .
I am certain that , with the capability which distinguishes you , Minister , you will address this matter .     – Mr President , I should like to thank the representative of the Austrian Presidency but , at the same time , I want to express my regret about the bureaucratic way in which he replied , as representative of the Presidency , to my question on an issue which truly constitutes violation of the principles of international law and the Founding Charter of the UN.
However , I must say to you that we may have lifted the state of emergency , but five opposition members of parliament have been arrested and are now in gaol .
I am delighted about the simplification measures you presented .
I should like to ask the Commissioner if the Commission can channel more Community resources within the framework of 'twinning projects ' in order to improve healthcare , protect children and improve conditions in mental hospitals .
The two rounds of the open method of coordination on social integration at the level of the 15 and , since 2004 , the 25 Member States have demonstrated that the rationalisation of the open method of coordination needs to be safeguarded in social protection and in social integration .
It is a very strong means of combating poverty and social exclusion .
As part of this effort , I too should like to emphasise certain things : Firstly , the measures applied must be based on adequate , substantiated scientific studies , taking account of the peculiarities of each area .
It is therefore important to make provision for adequate resources to support efforts .
Fourthly , it is very important that stricter measures be taken to protect seas from contamination either from land or sea and Fifthly , seas know no borders .
It allows nationals of the Member States to be extradited and it basically abolishes the principle of double jeopardy and the facility for the political leadership to decide on the extradition of an individual , thereby reversing the basic principles and guarantees of protection of individual rights safeguarded under previous extradition law .
It is also hypocritical to condemn forced prostitution , because it stabilises and extends legal prostitution .
In other words , the rot in the exploitative system is being concealed and exonerated , and it is rejecting its responsibilities and referring the problem to the individual sphere .
We say no to all forms of prostitution .     Nature provides water free of charge ; water belongs to everyone and everyone must have access to it .
The ΕU is promoting the policy of liberalising services within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy .
We call on the working class and the grass roots to fight to overturn the barbaric , anti-grass roots plans of their exploiters .     The joint motion for a resolution signed and being promoted in the European Parliament by the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe on the Lisbon Strategy aims to speed up capitalist restructurings even more , by drawing up national programmes .
It calls on the working class to step up its fight against the barbaric attack by capital , to make its fight an anti-monopoly , anti-imperialist fight and to build up its alliance for grass-roots power and prosperity .     – Mr President , Madam President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , I should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur and chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Mr Brok , on his very important report and , at the same time , congratulate you , Madam President-in-Office of the Council , for the interest and the decisiveness which you demonstrate , both as the Austrian Minister of Foreign Affairs and as President-in-Office of the Council , on the question of the Balkans .
As far as Turkey is concerned , I want to say that I support the European prospects of Turkey , but I think , as you quite rightly said , that we need to focus , initially , on the question of the Ankara Protocol .
Finally , as far as Serbia is concerned , I agree with the need and with the fact that Serbia 's cooperation with the Tribunal in the Hague is its obligation , but this is one part of a set of criteria which Serbia needs to meet and I want to ask that we be careful not to ' Croatise ' the case of Serbia .
My political group emphasises the demand for Turkey to implement the preconditions set with a specific timetable , starting with the faithful application , without infringements , of the Ankara Protocol .
Who decides who will join Europe ?
Of course , it is not very smart to have to tell our friends the Turks that they must not insult the President of the European Parliament .
They cannot threaten a state of Europe with war , with a , while we talk about letting them in .
Can they not recognise a government which has been recognised by the other 24 ?
May I remind you that , when you applied to join the UN as the Germanic Republic of Austria , Germany – at that time vanquished Germany – vetoed it and you entered as Austria ?
Why do we not have , at long last , an independent policy and have to follow the Americans ' game of upsetting Russia and taking their satellites and opening up a front with Iran and so on ?
