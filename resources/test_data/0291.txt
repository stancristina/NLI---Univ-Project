and lack of consistency in the Council 's position whereby the issue of the Data Act would be included in the directive .
Citizens have reason to be worried .
The issues must be subjected to democratic and legal controls .
This is quite a while ago now .
I will content myself with this welcome message and have therefore withdrawn my request on this matter .
I also think that the rapporteur , Mrs Korhola , is entirely correct in reinstating the majority of amendments from the first reading , as they were adopted unanimously by Parliament .
I am not , however , happy about the decision by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy concerning the cost of what the authority can take out .
Mr President , honourable Members , environmental issues are handled best when all the citizens concerned participate at the relevant level .
This convention is a major step forwards in terms of implementing Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration and continuing the process of openness initiated by Council Directive 90/313/EEC on the freedom of access to information on the environment .
I personally consider that it is very important that the Community ratify the convention as quickly as possible .
Most of the European Parliament 's amendments reinstate the amendments not accepted by the Commission at the first reading and designed to strengthen the Commission 's proposal .
It covers the most important commitments under the Århus Convention , and others besides , and gives the Member States sufficient flexibility to be able to implement the legislation effectively .
The remaining amendments cannot be accepted by the Commission , namely Amendments Nos 1-6 , 7 part 1 and part 2 , 8 , 10-18 , 20 , 21 , 23-26 , 27 part 1 , 29 , 31 , 34-41 , 43 , 44 , 47 and 48 with the exception of part 2.
I should like to say a big thank-you to Mrs Myller , to all my fellow MEPs and , of course , to the entire Conciliation Committee for having made this work possible .
We must place our hopes in Environment Commissioner Mrs Wallström and the thematic strategies which are now to be adopted through co-decision .
- ( SV ) In the European Parliament 's first and second readings of the Sixth Environment Action Programme , we Swedish Conservatives voted against the introduction of EU taxes in the areas of the environment and energy .
We support a number of lines of thought , for example to the effect that the common agricultural policy must do more to promote multifunctionality in agriculture , that environmental requirements must be integrated into all forms of support , that support must promote smaller family farms , that the renationalisation of agricultural policy must be rejected , that support will have to be decoupled from production and that more extensive farming should be promoted .
It is also maintained that future reforms should , in the first place , be aimed at stopping the loss of jobs in agriculture , which is not our own view .
What , however , is equally clear is that there is a very great need for reform .
The Chamber is often packed , even though more people often attend the committee meetings .
I believe it would be good for the legitimacy of the EU if all school pupils were to have the opportunity to visit us .
We should be proud of this openness , even if there is room for a number of improvements , which are also under way .
Instead of a vigorous debate in the Chamber , with quick responses and opposition , we have a series of long monologues in which we read out our papers written in advance , as I am doing today .
Our president is helping with this by ensuring that we table political proposals and , with Mr Corbett 's report , we are taking quite a few very significant steps forward .
We should like to take still further steps with a view to obtaining more lively debates and disposing of more issues that come before the European Parliament .
As Mrs Kaufmann indicated , we are carrying out important work on human rights which has resonance far beyond the walls of this Chamber .
It is a question of introducing the right of co-decision on a greater number of issues , of getting rid of the peculiar way of dividing up the budget and of dealing with the matter of travel between Strasbourg and Brussels .
Mr President , I wish to thank Mrs Figueiredo for a very important and sound report .
That is worrying for , as Mr Pronk pointed out , responsibility for social security and integration lies with the Member States or at lower levels , resulting in a need for governments in the Member States that are concerned to prioritise solidarity and social integration .
We know that there are antagonisms and conflicting interests and priorities in political life .
I also hope that this will be the case tomorrow when we vote on the report .
What , therefore , I in actual fact miss in the report is a considered opinion discussing the peace plan in actual fact adopted in 1991 by all the parties directly involved in the conflict .
Mr President , on this issue , we are completely in agreement with the rapporteur , Mrs Roth-Behrendt , and with the decision taken by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .
We are therefore in favour both of a total ban on such animal experiments and of a marketing ban .
This issue has been discussed for a long time , indeed for too long .
The possibility has been mentioned of a conflict with the WTO
