I should like to focus on the individual areas for intervention , starting with medical research .
To conclude , although the seventh framework programme has missed making a quality leap , it does represent a step forwards on the way to creating a genuinely European research area , and I therefore thank Mr Buzek and all the shadow rapporteurs for the work they have accomplished .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as shadow rapporteur for the seventh framework programme and rapporteur for the ‘People ’ specific programme , it is my duty first of all to thank Mr Buzek and all the Members with whom we undertook this difficult work in the knowledge that it had to be done quickly and well , even without any prospect of agreement on the financial perspective .
At Lisbon , Europe set itself the target of becoming a world leader again by 2010 .
No researchers means no research , few researchers means little research , and many researchers means a great deal of research .
It must be made clear , however , that the seventh framework programme must under no circumstances fund research into human cloning , genetic mutations or the use of embryonic stem cells .
This framework programme , the first one in the Europe of 25 , reflects a decision to maintain substantial continuity with the previous one .
There is just one matter that remains unsettled , and more than any other it stirs our conscience in a variety of ways : the question of ethics .
It is not written down that the European Union wants to fund human cloning .
I welcome this revitalisation of basic research : research at the frontiers of knowledge , promoting dynamism , competitiveness and creativity at the highest level .
We need new researchers in order to reach the target of eight researchers for every 1 000 employees , both men and women .
Perhaps the most ambitious objective that we have set ourselves is the seventh framework programme , which today represents the European added value that is essential if we are to achieve that result .
It is therefore quite right to acknowledge them and , if possible , to find solutions that take account of these facets , which relate to human beings and their dignity .
In fact I am against human cloning .
On the contrary , they must press the national governments to increase the financial appropriation for research in their budgets and thus improve working conditions in the area , as regards both the possible development of human resources in the public sector and the promotion of private investment and public-private partnerships .
In order to comprehend these kinds of issues , we first of all need to understand what we are talking about .
Lastly , the principle of subsidiarity needs to be invoked .
For all the rest , limiting our possibilities means depriving many people of the hope of a better future .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the violation of human rights in Tunisia has now taken a shocking turn .
The time has come , therefore , to react .
It is important to strictly maintain that line during the negotiations on the future partnership agreement .
I believe , in fact , that there is a broader issue and I generally agree with the content of the Gargani report .
You are aware how dangerous counterfeiting is for industry in European countries and for consumer health , apart from causing the exploitation of child labour to produce fake goods .
Every month , 1.5 million European citizens use cocaine , 9.5 million use cannabis , and 3 million use this drug on a more or less habitual basis , meaning every day .
I am worried about Amendments 8 , 15 , 18 and 32 to 39 .
I shall just make a brief comment on Amendment 15 , which provides for the European Parliament to issue an opinion on the centre’s three-year programme of work .
Apart from these objections , I support both the report and the rapporteur’s amendments .     – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I cannot fail to welcome your speech , Mr  Frattini , because it has accurately highlighted how serious the drug problem is in the European Union .
For example , it was unacceptable for an Italian Government representative to state that he favoured the possibility of controlled drug use through what are known as ‘injecting rooms’ .
The Member States have not succeeded in doing this but , unfortunately , neither have we .
We therefore endorse what the Council has done , even though we know that words are one thing and actions are quite something else , and we have already made various proposals and requests that have not been exhausted to date .
I shall conclude by addressing you , Mr Winkler , because when you spoke about Tunisia yesterday , we were very disappointed and surprised .
The ties of solidarity linking the European left to the new Italian Government have until now prevented this obvious question from being brought to people’s attention and debated within the European Union .
That is why the constitutional process needs to be concluded .
In order to do this , however , we need to go beyond the period of reflection on the institutional issue as quickly as possible .
Europeans have growing doubts about the legally binding aspect of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which lacks important references such as protection of the family .
I should like to extract and highlight three key words that I consider essential from the contribution made by Parliament in the shape of the unanimous resolution on which we shall vote tomorrow .
I very much agree with the need to define a concise set of , let us say , multicriterial indicators , which
