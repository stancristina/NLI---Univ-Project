the constant objective of the full integration and application of European principles and the .
This is the fault of Europe , for failing to clarify the qualitative criteria in an objective , reliable and functional manner , for failing to lay down the political geography , its political limits , and for failing to define the dialectic ratio between deepening and enlarging .
The remarks in the report about the state of accession readiness of the two countries presented today by the Commission are also correct .
Bulgaria , Romania and the Union of the 25 must up the ante , step up efforts and demonstrate a convergent and creative political will to make the Europe of the 27 a reality on 1 January 2007 .
The battle against corruption , the reorganisation of the judicial system and guarding the borders are some of the problems which need to be resolved more quickly .
However , I consider that the application of legislation – its practical application on a daily basis – is more important than its reform .
Basically , and with your reply today , it must be concluded that this is a question of collusion on the part of the European Commission , the governments in the Member States and the companies at the workers ' expense .
The first question is the extent to which there is a binding obligation for the Member States to collect waste by category .
The second question is the extent to which the Commission considers that the practice , especially as regards collection , destruction and so on , is or is not successful .
Of course they help , because publicity and maximum awareness-raising among citizens are important elements in finding optimum waste management solutions .
The European Union funds the combating of waste ; this is , in fact , one of the priorities of the Cohesion Fund .
Is it possible to estimate over time , in parallel to the ecological consequences , the economic and social consequences of failing to comply with the relevant Community legislation and to find a more effective compliance procedure than that of referring the Member States to the Court of Justice of the European Communities ?     .
This is a particularly important strategy which is horizontal and holistic , which deals with the problem of waste as a whole and , of course , will provide answers to many of the problems which exist and which , due to disputes , often lead to the courts .
I hope that , in this way , waste in the European Union will , firstly , be limited .
The Psyttalia station has been operating fully since December 2004 and takes care of third-level treatment of urban sewage discharged into the sensitive area of the Saronic Gulf .
There are similar applications in other European countries .
However , despite all these positive developments , there is still the problem of the management of the sewage sludge already stored on the island and of the sewage sludge which will be produced on a daily basis until the proposed drying unit is commissioned .
Consequently , the Commission considers the method of disposal of the sludge referred to above to be incompatible with Community environmental legislation .
Does the Commission know if this promise will be kept and what alternative solution is being proposed ?
Finally , the contractor for drying the sewage sludge in Psyttalia has still not been selected , even though it is two years since August 2003 .
The problem , therefore , is in the interim period and what will happen with the sewage sludge which is currently being dumped at the Ano Liosia landfill using a partial soilification procedure , which is at the pilot stage at present , whereby the material produced can be used either to cover the landfill or to reinforce the ground in certain areas .
However , I have a feeling that there is a contradiction between strictness , between being justifiably strict on issues of infringement of European environmental legislation , and the acceptance of acceptable waste management standards .
I should like to start by referring to how strict or less strict we are .
The honourable Member said that the Commission should have even more competences and should indicate specific methods .
On the specific question of Psyttalia , the European Union has intervened in the financing of the first project , which was third-level treatment of waste , and now the drying unit .
However , what I should like to emphasise is that we believe in the sustainability of the sea , which is why we feel that the five fishing vessels we are asking for is a very small number of vessels which will not cause any imbalance .
However , this does not imply that we need to handle the question by imposing stricter measures which will call the political and other freedoms of innocent citizens into question .
In general terms , the present proposal takes a stricter , but not necessarily a more effective approach to the problem .
We need to combat organised crime , but not to safeguard order by dismantling the body of our individual and political freedoms .     . – Mr President , I too wish to thank the rapporteur , Mr Pittella , who has set both the political vision of this budget and the technical vision , which is direct and functional .
However , nor will the European Parliament be credible if it votes for the amendment by the Committee on Budgets , on the basis of which Community subsidies are being put in reserve , by which we mean frozen , at a time when the reform of the COM in tobacco is here and has been voted on by all the governments of the Member States
