crisis , incomes are falling drastically and areas are being abandoned .
In addition , no provision whatsoever is made for the subsidies needed for the industry , as the rapporteur rightly points out .
Today , Asia is giving dynamic presence to and affecting the international system and is helping to shape the new power correlations of the 21st century .
From this point of view , the ASEM summit in Helsinki had positive results , because it confirmed certain basic principles of multilateral cooperation and highlighted the basic priorities for meeting the new international challenges .
Furthermore , multilateral cooperation and the rules of conduct are being cited on their terms , for example , in the fields of environmental protection , workers ' social rights and women 's and children 's rights .
I have a feeling that at every summit there is a surfeit of wish lists and a lack of clear commitments and objectives being laid down for implementation .
It has also highlighted conflicting interests between manufacturers , on the one hand , and suppliers and consumers , on the other .
By contrast , dumping practices are a primary protective measure - and one which distorts trade .
As the Commission itself confirms , there was no benefit to the European consumer , given that prices remained stable or even increased slightly in certain instances .
This parameter is becoming more and more important given that , in the enlarged European Union , there is a constant increase in women from various areas of the world who are immigrating either in isolation , as independent economic migrants , or within the framework of the migration of their families or for other reasons , accounting for approximately 54 % of all immigrants , although this is not an exact figure .
In our report , reference is made to the problems faced by female immigrants .
Even worse are the cases of forced marriages and crimes of honour .
Within this framework of national legislation , therefore , we support respect for the rights of women , their family rights and , more importantly , the rights of children , in accordance with international conventions and protocols .
Thus our objectives for development and prosperity and our fight for solidarity , justice throughout the world and the protection of human rights will be better achieved .
My warmest thanks to all the political groups whose participation enriched my work and helped us to prepare a text which is cohesive , respects subsidiarity and the Community and international legal acquis and includes a courageous and in-depth approach to the real problems and the real challenges .
That is why I heartily support the call for another EUR 50 billion to be added to the LIFE+ budget .
If the percentage remains 40 % , this essentially will mean a proportional reduction in the corresponding funding for biodiversity in comparison with the previous financial perspective and that is unacceptable .
We want a strong European policy ; all of us in the European Parliament want more Europe for environmental protection .
That is why the citizens of the European Union are rightly calling for a more effective approach .
One of them was recast , which the Commission chose and which is the least ambitious choice , because it introduces a limited number of improvements to the Council decision governing the civil protection mechanism .
However , this shortcoming undermines the effectiveness of European aid .
Today , Community civil protection aid is provided by the Member States on a voluntary basis .
The third problem relates to early warning .
That is why a suitable legal basis must be set up within the framework of the Council decision , so that early warning systems can be developed within the framework of the mechanism .
This fragmentation and lack of coordination completely contradict the ambitious announcements by the European Council .
In January 2006 , the President of the European Commission and the President of the European Council asked Michel Barnier to examine the role of the European Union in dealing with crises .
The price of the lack of a unified and effective Europe when it comes to crisis management is very high , which is why we need to proceed more effectively and with greater coordination .
As far as the amendments to the initial proposal are concerned , I consider it necessary to draw your attention to the following points : An effective early warning and response system is founded on the following four components : identifying and assessing risks , constantly monitoring them , a warning and communication mechanism and , lastly , preparedness - the capacity to react and assist .
I too , like the rapporteur , should like to emphasise that the amendments which we tabled concern matters such as the early warning system , standby modules from the participating states , response and citizen information guidelines , best practices for dealing with situations and , lastly , mutual consular assistance for determining contact points between Member States .
I think that , together with your report today , we shall have an effective mechanism .
In cooperation with the European Commission and the Council , we have come to the final version of the text of the MEDIA 2007-2013 programme , which gives especial added value to the development of the European audiovisual sector which , apart from its economic benefit and importance and the anticipated contribution to the development of employment in the European Union and of the competitiveness of the audiovisual industry , also has a particular social and cultural value .
( The President cut off the speaker ) The development of strong and adequate mechanisms to prevent and deal with natural disasters is fundamental for the protection , assistance and relief of the victims of natural disasters and for dealing with environmental disasters .
