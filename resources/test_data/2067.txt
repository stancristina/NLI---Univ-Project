In the debate here today , I agree with Mr Titley that we have a tendency to ignore the fact that the population of Iraq has in actual fact been liberated from a tyrant .
The United States went into Iraq on the basis of arguments concerning Iraq 's alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction and links with Al Qaeda .
As I am well aware , having worked for the UN , tender procedures of this type normally go via the UN or the World Bank , and that is of course what should happen in this case too .
The basis on which we ourselves are entitled to make agreements has been established precisely in order to create stability and predictability in relations between our states .
I am therefore disappointed that the EU has not succeeded in uniting around a proactive plan for how best to make use of our special experience of reconstruction .
I would therefore call upon both the Presidency and the Commission immediately to devise such a proposal so that the EU can regain a portion of its reputation and , above all , play that central role in international politics and in this region that the situation demands .
The definition of the biodiversity in connection with which liability for damages might arise was too narrow .
I am pleased about this honesty , and I therefore hope that the Commission 's approach will in actual fact prevail .
There is a risk of the EU not being so unanimous in its approach to Russia as this debate suggests .
There are forces that may intervene in such a way as to cause division in the EU 's view .
I really do hope that the policy adopted by the Commission will apply .
It was really not , however , the PCA Agreement that led the way but , rather , money .
Issues of marine safety , the environment and human rights must be on the agenda .
If we are serious about wishing to protect her , we must press our countries to give her protection against this type of state persecution which is , de facto , exercised against many women .
For the first time , we would have seen economic and employment policy guidelines coordinated in terms of time , but that was unfortunately not to be the case .
That is serious because it means that the important balance between the two processes will go to pot .
The EU now finds itself in a difficult economic situation , with weak demand , low levels of investment and growing unemployment in ever more Member States .
It is a question first and foremost of reducing labour costs and the attendant social costs , but that leads to a reduction in domestic demand , which is incredibly important .
Now , the same Pact is instead giving rise to deflation and growing unemployment .
My own country , Sweden , is to hold a referendum on EMU in September , and , with each month that goes by , opposition to the euro is growing , both among the general public and among economic and political experts .
It is impossible to save our way out of the crisis .
I agree with the rapporteur that a new approach to economic policy is required , but what new approach ?
On average , that is of course no doubt the case , but the fact remains that , beneath that average , the reality varies incredibly from one EU country to another .
In 2002 , growth in the eurozone was 0.9 % compared with 1.8 % in the three EU countries not participating in economic and monetary union .
Another problem for Germany is that , in a depression , it cannot , independently and on the basis of its own needs , decide how large a budget deficit it is to permit for the time being in accordance with normal principles of economic policy .
There is the feeling that EMU and the euro have become holy cows that cannot be criticised at all within the EU.
The experiment involving a compulsory , uniform and standardised economic policy for all the EU countries has proved a failure .
We Moderates have today voted against Mr Schmitt 's report because we believe that the stated legal basis is inadequate .
We do not , however , agree with certain of the points , to the effect that there must be greater wage flexibility and that it would be good to reduce the overall tax rates in the EU.
Mr President , I can only agree with the previous speaker .
It would be unfair if Taiwan , which is one of the countries affected by SARS , were not to be able to make its voice heard and not to be represented in Geneva .
Mr President , I believe that there are many of us who are deeply concerned about what is happening in Vietnam .
The European Parliament too has expressed its concern on previous occasions .
The list of methods of oppression includes the draft law designed to abolish the right of small farmers to demonstrate peacefully in pursuit of their rights .
In this connection , I want especially to mention the UBCV.
Mr President , I am deputising for the draftsman , Mr Wynn , who has unfortunately been delayed .
Unlike at present , the draft budget would mean future expenditure having to be taken out of the EU budget .
It now remains for us to see how high the costs of enlargement , buildings policy etc . will be .
All that has really caused us concern up until now is the point concerning everyone 's right to direct interpretation which , strictly construed , could have entailed unreasonable costs .
Mr President , our aim today is
