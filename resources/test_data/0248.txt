demands in the workforce .
I fully support Mrs Weiler 's proposal that visa requirements should be abolished for family members of migrant workers now living here .
They must be accorded equal status to those in traditional families when determining benefits .
It would be very embarrassing if we did not get consensus on it .
This is one of the four basic rights that comprise the cornerstones of European integration .
These freedoms concern , as they must , the citizens of the Union first and foremost .
At the moment , legislation makes it impossible to put the citizens of the Union and a workforce originating outside the Union on an equal footing .
The academic pass system that Mrs Weiler stresses will improve the situation regarding the equivalence of qualifications ; it is in itself to be supported , but its introduction must rely very much on cooperation between national authorities in the spirit of subsidiarity .
We believe that a rapid reform is necessary .
It is true that , under our current rules , the identity of the petitioner must be checked .
We must try to speed this up , and , at the same time , we must also perhaps make use of new legislative proposals regarding electronic signatures .
In addition , we agree that petitions must be treated in the same way , irrespective of the way in which they have been submitted .
These rules have a different approach , namely that to obtain access to a document submitted to Parliament , we should not turn to Parliament but to the person who produced the document .
At the same time , it is our responsibility as Members of Parliament to consider the nature of the matter and not the number of petitions when deciding priorities .
The Court of First Instance 's ruling on the Council of Ministers ' documents , the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam and new methods for the Council of Ministers ' work are all examples of this .
A particularly important contribution to increased public access has been made by the Ombudsman through the Special Report which we shall debate , and through several other initiatives .
It is the first time that we in a part-session of Parliament have to make a decision on such a report .
On the other hand , we share the Ombudsman 's opinion that there are no grounds for formal recommendations , with the legal meaning that recommendations have under the Statute of the European Ombudsman .
As we state in the report , what we expect from the Commission is , inter alia , the following : We regret that the Amsterdam Treaty 's new rule to be adopted regarding openness formally applies only to the Commission , the Council and Parliament .
Today , on the basis of Ombudsman Söderman 's speech and Mr Newman 's report , we have talked a lot about the issue of a code of good administrative praxis , a code of conduct on good administrative practice and the significance thereof .
Such a code means that we adopt minimum standards for good administrative practice .
We also emphasize in our report that public access to documents is not worth much if not everyone can find out which documents exist and then request some of them .
In the debate following the Intergovernmental Conference it has been maintained that the rules to be adopted regarding public access can apply only to documents that are produced within the institutions .
The declaration attached to the Treaty concerns expressly the correspondence of the Member States .
In addition , I would like to issue a challenge to all the Member States who say they support public access , that they limit as far as possible requests to keep a document confidential .
We ought also to ensure that this is how it actually works .
We can confirm that it has led to practically all institutions and bodies having rules on public access , with the Court of Justice as a regrettable exception .
They have published their rules on access to documents in the OJ or on their websites .
I believe the President is going to propose that recital D is a superfluous recital in the report .
When we are able to go further with public access , it is important for us in future to obtain more precise rules for all institutions , in which deviations from the principle of openness are as precise as possible and as small as possible .
Above all , I would like to express my thanks to the Ombudsman , Mr Söderman , for the splendidly energetic work he has done in the name of greater transparency , public access and EU credibility .
I am in full agreement with the conclusions Mrs Thors expressed in her own report .
But it is by no means enough that we know what maladministration is .
Mr President , when we investigate exactly which agencies are at present involved in creating transparency for the European Union , it is with gratitude that we cite the fundamental work of the Ombudsman .
As a result of this work , nearly all Union institutions have regulations that have to be observed whenever the general public wishes to receive documentation from them .
And the Council cannot hide away , for citizens must have the general right of access to documents from the institutions of the European Union .
It was gratifying to hear the Commissioner say that a working document on this matter might appear in the autumn .
Rather too often such notions as general security and international relations are used as justification for denying access to documents .
Our group hopes that the Ombudsman might help to define these notions more exactly
