There is a great temptation to move to the rigid formation of a bloc and to raise the external borders and tariff walls of the European Union high enough to resist competition from elsewhere .
Nevertheless , I have the impression that the emphasis is shifting towards the informal coordination of state aid .
I hope my colleagues will support this .
Mr President , I would also like to explain my vote on paragraph 29 of the Schulz report on the resignation of Judge Wathelet .
But there is no fundamental difference between Amendment No 2 and paragraph 29 , only a difference in gradation .
Paragraph K of the preamble on the lack of harmonization of employment and social security conditions and the resulting supposed disruption in the fisheries sector is certainly not helpful to ever achieving a better fisheries policy .
Small-scale fisheries are given greater protection .
It is just scheduled a little later now .
In addition , investment in developing countries can play a crucial role in this .
Mr President , we look forward to the negotiations in Tokyo with high hopes .
" Après moi , le déluge ' as we also say in Holland .
This relates in particular to the protection of free trade .
That fear seems grossly exaggerated .
My question is : would it not be sensible to complete the inquiry , both into the number of members and into the time that those members have spent on the Economic and Social Committee , to give the Council , which is politically responsible for the appointment of the members of the Economic and Social Committee , the opportunity to take the necessary action ?
Or have they been applied correctly and were they incorrect from the outset ?
This will mean that we will be able to look into the situation regarding the quality of our food .
I assume that sick animals cannot be used , but what can be done with other animal meal ?
Indeed , in addition to the BSE dossier , there is organized crime , which has made use of this file to transfer food products illegally and on a massive scale from Great Britain to countries within Europe , and also to other countries outside the European Union .
That as many as ten Member States have not implemented them is a serious omission .
Governments are answerable to their national parliament ; the European Parliament is overplaying its hand on this .
Everyone who can add up knows that 90 divided by 128 makes 703 , 125 Belgian francs per cubicle .
When it concerns fraud , when it concerns the misuse of expenses , travel expenses , and so on , the Members of this Parliament - and I tell you , Mr President , that is 95 % of this Parliament - think it is important that things are clarified as soon as possible , so that accusations cannot be made out of the blue for others to consider as well , and which we have nothing to do with .
The report produced by the Committee of Inquiry and the Temporary Committee is excellent .
How can we make sure that the Member States follow up European concerns on an international level ?
I would like to mention , as others have done before me , the illegal transit of meat , for example in Flushing harbour , and I would also like to mention the infected cow in Belgium which was turned into bone meal .
If we had closed down the committee in February , we would not have been able to present the same result today .
We can be satisfied , but should not be triumphant .
Mistakes have been made , and the European Commission is not succeeding in taking the necessary disciplinary action .
My question to you is : do fiscal motives play a part , and not just the participation of workers ?
I believe that this first step should be a very clear one .
Clear enough to inspire trust , trust on the part of the citizen that finally , after all those exaggerated stories , after that huge amount of paperwork , there will be action .
Secondly , a important goal is benchmarking : to direct our policy , our targets at the performance of the three countries with the best performance .
Much has been said about the summit in Luxembourg , but we must realize that we are now involved in an exercise which rises above that , which constantly tries to improve the still unhappy employment situation in the European Union .
I originally wondered how it would be possible to discuss these two very different reports in one debate , but actually it makes complete sense .
The Jöns report states quite rightly that it is incomplete , that we will have to do more for atypical industrial relations than this report alone , that this might be a small contribution .
Mr President , the Jöns report is also under discussion .
Mr President , the agreement between the social partners on part-time work is , to be honest , even more dreadful than the original one which covered parental leave ; what is more , the treatment of part-time workers is undermined by countless exceptions in this agreement , and the flexi-workers have simply been fobbed off .
We really must get rid of this corporatist procedure which farms out European social policy to social partners without there being a parliamentary driving force .
We are delighted that Commissioner Bonino will be present in Ottawa .
Mr President , I would like to begin by saying to the Commissioner how pleased I am to see him at this late hour .
Such a policy does , however , lead to the erosion of low
