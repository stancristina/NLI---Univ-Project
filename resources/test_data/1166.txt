measures , concluded agreements with third countries with a view to using these countries ’ territorial waters in exchange for financial compensation .
The fourth and last point is that the agreement ’s implementation will be monitored , with particular attention being paid to the sanitation aspects of catches .
This agreement was concluded as the result both of discussions and of a wealth of experience , which should in future be applied to cases similar to that of Mozambique .
This clearly runs counter to the Community approach .
Written in clear language , which does not give way to hyperbole or the bureaucratic metaphysics that we unfortunately still find in some of the Court’s texts , they repeat a diagnosis originally made in 1990 .
My heartiest congratulations once again , therefore , to the Court of Auditors on the work it has done .     – Madam President , measures facilitating the simplification of procedures and formalities are always positive , and in this particular case of health care provision they are even more important because they will help to make the free movement of persons easier .
The entry into force of the European Health Insurance Card will be a great step towards achieving this fundamental objective .
The entry into force of the European Health Insurance Card will result in a harmonisation of the rights of insured people and their family members whether they are travelling , studying or posted abroad , or are job-seekers or international road transport drivers .
Such changes mean that the insured must be properly informed on their rights and duties deriving from the new legislation and it will be up to the Member States to ensure that their citizens are given this information .
In the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries which I drafted for the 2003 Community Budget , I expressed my concern about the implementation and financing of this programme .
Because of this non-renewal , the Community fleet has fallen victim to a large number of restrictions .
Sustained socio-economic flanking measures are therefore needed to alleviate the dire effects of this failure to renew the agreement with Morocco .
In this respect we agree with the rapporteur regarding not only her approval of the current scheme but also the change in the legal basis from Article 37 to Article 299( 2 ) of the Treaty establishing the European Community , relating to the specific characteristics of the outermost regions .
The special difficulties that affect the outermost regions are well known , especially those associated with the marketing of their products outside their individual territories .
It is therefore important to ensure that this process of modernisation and renovation can continue without constraints deriving from Community legislation .
This derogation is fundamental for the outermost regions , and it will be even more valuable if the Council accepts the following proposals from Parliament : - public aid for fleet renovation should be available until the end of 2006 instead of December 2004 ; - an evaluation of these measures should be produced so that it can be examined whether they should continue after 2006 ; - advances against the aid should be allowed to reach 14 % instead of the current 7 % .     . – This resolution does not greatly further the positions that Parliament has been upholding in respect of so-called ‘European governance’ , a euphemism used by federalists of all colours for the move towards the creation of a future European government – ‘obviously ’ the European Commission – with ‘European’ social partners , aimed at a so-called ‘European public opinion’ .
This would be a positive step , although the process must be monitored so that no worthwhile elements of the Community are lost and to ensure that democratic legitimacy is not jeopardised .
Hence the importance of these measures for ship engines also .
I support this report , which is intended to provide a new boost for measures to combat corruption , detailing what has been done and what needs to be improved and identifying the areas in which the Union should focus its efforts in the fight against corruption .
Coordinated action by these bodies ( Eurojust , Europol , OLAF and the European Judicial Network ) will strengthen the actions undertaken by national police forces and will facilitate transnational investigations , by sharing the Member States’ information capacities .     .
In other words , this is another instrument designed to support the EU’s immigration policy , which gives priority to a repressive mindset , attempting , in this case , to guarantee financial compensation for the countries of origin of ‘illegal ’ immigrants for signing readmission agreements .     .
This Commission proposal to amend the regulation on organic farming seeks , primarily , to clarify problems of terminology , at a time when this concept is being used wrongly by supermarket chains and by some multinational agri-food companies .
I am extremely unhappy that the report does not address the set of issues surrounding GMOs , including what is known as ‘coexistence ’ or issues of genetic pollution and also overlooks the aid and protection given to organic seeds .
Similarly , biodiversity must be preserved , crops and products must be protected and all and any pollution of organic crops by Genetically Modified Organisms must be avoided .
Firstly , Portugal will gain only 150 tonnes of shrimp ( plus 80 by-catches ) and permits for five longliners , despite the needs of its fleet and despite its traditions of fishing in Mozambican waters .
On the subject of reduced rates , however , and bearing in mind the concept of tax sovereignty , it should be recalled that the Member States must maintain the necessary flexibility in implementing social and cultural policies , in particular when setting reduced VAT rates .
