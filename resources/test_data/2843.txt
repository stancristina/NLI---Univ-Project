Moreover , the new rules are clearly better than the lawless situation in respect of public access to documents that currently prevails .
These rules are in total conflict with the Swedish principle of public access to official records that has characterised Swedish government for over 250 years .
The introduction to the Regulation states that the purpose is not to change existing legislation in the Member States .
This suggests that the old-fashioned Commission is still characterised by bureaucracy and an unwillingness to change .
The ELDR Group will be pushing the issue further .
From a Swedish perspective , I fear that the agreement reached between the EU' s three institutions will lead to a weakening of our principle of public access to official records and legislation dating back to the sixteenth century .
The result has been that a conciliation was negotiated between the European Parliament , the Council and the Commission as early as during the first reading , without individual parliamentarians or the public being given opportunity to follow the process .
In our capacity as politicians , our task is to warn of the risks of smoking , to reduce the harmfulness of tobacco products and to attempt to get rid of misleading marketing .
I consider that the conciliation we have achieved with the Council of Ministers is an obvious step in the right direction in this area .
In two areas , we would have liked measures to have been taken more quickly , but we feel that we are at least on the right track .
We would also like there to have been faster progress regarding export bans on tobacco products that are not approved under EU rules .
It means that the exemption under which Sweden may keep its traditional snuff will be retained without the market in other EU countries being opened up .
Possibly EUR 1 billion per year is still spent on subsidies for tobacco cultivation .
We have succeeded in getting the most important issues of principle through , for example , that the user stage , that is , those who feed the animals , is also to be covered by the controls .
The term 'contaminated ' must be defined in purely scientific terms with reference to substances and/or bacteria that have been added from outside , whereas 'contain undesirable substances ' also includes those substances that are formed naturally , e.g . in the course of storage , when fat oxidises and mycotoxins are formed .
I have reintroduced all the amendments to the effect that 'contaminated ' should be replaced by 'contain dangerous substances ' .
We should endeavour to create legislation that is clear , consistent and easy to grasp.
Mr Staes will submit an oral amendment in this area which involves a certain expansion , and which I am able to approve .
Good laws are all very well , but they are just words on paper unless we have effective control and compliance .
The basic idea of the recycling proposal is that the polluter must pay
