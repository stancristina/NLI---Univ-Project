That is absolutely unacceptable and the European Union has made that quite clear not only in its communique but in a recent meeting held between our envoys and the Laurent Kabila 's foreign minister .
I am afraid the Commission has not the power to do so .
Therefore , it is very important that a clear calendar of commitment to the constitutional process and free and fair elections should be established as soon as possible .
It was not a campaign of conquer .
I am not prepared to sign a blank cheque .
We are talking about a number equivalent to the population of Brussels , so it is a dramatic situation .
Our intention now , as I explained to this House a few months ago , is that once some peace and stability is achieved , the Commission is prepared to implement a global plan of reconstruction and rehabilitation in the Great Lakes region .
I would like to emphasize that the Commission is not represented in the World Bank or the IMF but Member States are .
Let me repeat - because it is important that this House knows - that the identified corruption cases , connected with Commission cooperation , are virtually nil .
Worse still , it seems that we are still heading in the same direction !
There are reasons for apprehension in other areas , too .
Of course , we shall wait for the outcome but , at this moment in time , we cannot hide our considerable nervousness about what is likely to emerge .
We very much regret this .
But all of the consequences of that fact must be borne .
I should like to conclude expressing the hope that , nevertheless , we will stop speaking about Maastricht in June and that a new era in European construction will begin .
For this Pact , which has no legal base , to be politically more acceptable the Council has added to the title the word 'Growth ' without actually changing the content of the document .
Tax fraud and evasion , complex systems , no machinery for exchanging information , the increased tax burden on the labour market , the proliferation of 'offshore ' areas and more favourable tax regimes and impediments to the circulation of capital as a consequence of different rules for determining taxable objects and tax rates , inter alia , royalties and savings , are all obviously factors which explain the phenomenon of taxation competition .
As you know , these treaties deal with all categories of income , aimed to eliminate dual taxation , bilaterally harmonizing effective taxation rates at source and in the place of residence and avoiding tax invasion .
This is not , from my point of view , an appropriate response .
That positive role cannot be called into doubt given the developments which have fallen below the predictions in the Cecchini report , which were excessively optimistic , but back then it was impossible to predict the fall of the Berlin Wall and the recession of the early 1990s .
That is the desire that I wanted to express in my short speech .
We disagree with the Council 's proposal and therefore , quite logically , reject the Terrón i Cusí report .
We are not calling into question the need for cooperation in this field among Member States but , of course , we reject proposals such as this one which put a police state philosophy before the rights , freedoms and guarantees of citizens .
At the same time , patients are presently unable to assess the professional competence and experience of these practitioners .
Refusing to accept the powers of practices such as homeopathy , chiropractic , osteopathy , acupuncture or shiatsu is both surprising and useless .
On what side of the argument does the obscurantism lie ? the Crowley report ( A4-0088/97 ) Madam President , I think this is a very useful report , as we are seeing from the debate , because it gives an account of the work of the Committee on Petitions - an account fully deserved by the Committee on Petitions and its secretariat .
But I must not forget to point out the practical importance which petitions to the European Parliament have , for example in Portugal in the case of discrimination as regards salaries in the Banco Central Português and in the case of the customs agents , specific cases where many petitions were received - indicating that people expected an objective response to their problems from the European Parliament .
There might even have been some change through the pressure of the social consequences and we should be glad that it is recognised , albeit timidly , that reflection is called for - even on something which has already been decided .
When in various points of Mrs Randzio-Plath 's report we find concerns expressed about equity in taxation and the strengthening of the instrumental nature of fiscal policy in order to meet national situations which are so diverse , are we not aggravating certain wounds which we would prefer to ignore ?
The coordination of the budgetary and fiscal policies for Monetary Union is based on an initiative report by the European Parliament , which realised at a very early stage that it is essential to study not only the effects which the third stage of EMU might bring , but above all the new role which these policies should come to play in monetary stability , economic growth and the jobs market .
Budgetary policy should therefore tend towards the re-channelling of expenditure to help to create employment and improve the well-being and safety of the citizens , not to reduce that .
The concerns expressed about budgetary intervention are quite understandable when , with the single currency , countries will cease to be able to intervene in monetary and exchange procedures .
This report deals , inter alia , with the consequences , at the level
