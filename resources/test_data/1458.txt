prohibition policies , lumped together as 'prohibition' , have suffered continual failures and that these failures are recognised by the authorities themselves .
There are many who put more effort into discovering loopholes and omissions in the framework of the conventions or making new ones than in trying to implement them properly .
As an informed , responsible Parliament , we must not send the Union 's representatives at this meeting a single wrong sign , a single sign of weakness , a single sign of giving up .
Any ambiguity in this field will lead to disaster .
The proposal of the rapporteur , Mrs Kathalijne Buitenweg , is basically to amend the 1961 Convention on Narcotic Drugs through a reclassification of the scheduled substances .
I do not believe that supporting a movement to liberalise drugs can or should be the solution for an effective fight against the growing drug problem .
Mr President , Mrs Cerdeira Morterero , ladies and gentlemen , before starting the debate on Mrs Cerdeira 's report , I should like to thank her for its quality and to congratulate her personally on being here with us and to wish her a full and speedy recovery .
This instrument is for us , therefore , an essential aspect of the common immigration policy proposed by the Commission and was , in fact , the first of all the proposals that the Commission presented to the Council in execution of the Tampere mandate .
Secondly , the Commission is introducing a rendezvous clause , which lays down a period of two years after the transposition of the directive and specifies exactly which provisions must be subjected to priority review so as to open up the second phase , the second stage in the process of harmonising national legislation .
It is expected , however that they can be monitored after reunification when the family members ' residence permits are renewed .
I must therefore congratulate the Commissioner , Mr Ant√≥nio Vitorino , on the pragmatic approach that has made it possible to deal with the points that were still causing problems and include the compromises that have in fact been reached in the Council .
Family reunification is certainly one factor in this framework that will encourage the personal stability of the immigrant and support this integration .
My question is : when will the stability pact be reviewed , so that we can be sure of public investment , job creation , improved purchasing power and effective measures to tackle poverty and social exclusion ?
Mr President , Commissioner , the first part of my question is crucial ; it is absolutely fundamental .
They emphasise the need to fight against illegal immigration , and that is definitely an issue that concerns us all , but at the same time they emphasise the need for the ever better integration of immigration policy into our external relation policies , including the development of a partnership with countries of origin and transit in order to cooperate and have better control of illegal immigration .
I would say to the honourable Member that the Commission has been in contact with the United Kingdom authorities on this subject since July 2002 .
I do not anticipate that Article 34 could be used for that purpose .
The issue is how to prioritise the actions that should be taken .
However , we will definitely not drop the issue .
Each case is examined individually according to the personal circumstances and legal situation of each person .
The Commission shares Mr Turco 's opinion that it would be difficult for European Union citizens to understand that the classification system of Europol documents should be different from the classification system of European Union documents .
In the Commission 's opinion , this means that officially Europol 's Management Board only has to adopt such rules when the Danish initiative is ratified .
But it must be remembered that the questions raised by these initiatives are at the same time being examined by the Convention on the Future of Europe .
Lastly , as regards the field of data protection , the rules that exist in the current Europol Convention must be extended .
This is a good reason for getting rid of the 'convention ' instrument within the Area of Freedom , Security and Justice .
All these elements are welcome ; they are in line with the Commission communication of December 2002 on the institutional architecture of the European Union and I believe they fit in with the objectives of more effective police cooperation in the European area .
As the representatives of the European citizens , we have repeatedly asked for the necessary powers so that we can exercise the desirable democratic control over Europol .
Thirdly , Europol clearly needs to be subject to an adequate level of democratic control , putting an end to the current situation in which the European Parliament has been playing a purely marginal role .
The Return Action Programme of the Council adopted on 28 November 2002 , which is based on our communication , also calls for a comprehensive Community return policy , which should be gradually developed , starting with some practical steps for operational cooperation as the matter in hand .
In such cases it is important that we establish a clear legal framework for the transit procedures , especially as far as the use and competences of escorts in transit is concerned .
First , we are committed to the strategy of having common houses between the Commission and Parliament .
We have been in close contact with the services of the European Parliament and we are also following the evolution of the European audiovisual public sector , including the situation of Euronews , to have an overall picture and a better assessment of what we can do in the audiovisual sector , including television , to provide more information to the citizens
