With regard to the Bank 's accounts , it should be noted that these are not audited by any external firm of auditors .
The Court of Auditors has not prepared a report for years .
I should therefore like to hear the Commission say what it does to monitor the funds , and I should also like to hear the Bank 's president say whether the Bank is more willing to open its doors to external audits .
Mr President , Commissioner , aquaculture is the fastest growing sector of world food production .
In view of the outcome of the December European Council and the restrictions that , in future fisheries policy , it has been decided to impose upon catches , there is a need for vision and joint strategies for aquaculture in the EU.
It is absolutely crucial to protect regions with strong fishing industries against job losses , creating more employment instead , just as it is to ensure that consumers have healthy and safe fisheries products of high quality and to ensure ecological balance and a sustainable environment .
Access to clean water is an essential , but also limiting , factor when we talk about freshwater fish farming .
This is a reason for stepping up research into increased recourse to recycling and re-use .
Investment in cleaner production and technology must be promoted and not be hampered by insufficient knowledge of environmental effects and by extensive use of the precautionary principle , the result of which would be differing conditions of production from one Member State to another , leading to a distortion of competition .
Since there continue to be many problems associated with this sector , including pollution , we choose to abstain from voting , even though we acknowledge the sterling work done by the committee .
Mr President , unfortunately , we are partly responsible for the fact that atrocities and genocide are committed in other parts of the world , because the EU never seriously dares to tread on the toes of powers such as Russia , China , Iran or Israel .
As a Dane , I should particularly like , however , to call for the two amendments to be adopted .
This is the kind of situation that neither Chechen politicians nor the Member States should be able to bring about in the future .
Madam President , I should like to know whether a dress code has been introduced here in Parliament .
The Chairman of the hearing , Mr Gargani , asked the officers to ensure that all the men put jackets on out of respect for the experts present , as he put it .
I should like to know if there is a new practice in Parliament .
As a matter of fact , I am wearing jeans , so I would ask you : do I have permission to be here as an MEP ?
Who was it really that created Saddam Hussein ?
When Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons of mass destruction against his own people , the United States was informed of the fact .
It would be an attack on international law and upon the whole UN system .
That is why it is important for Mr Solana and Mr Patten to call upon all the Member States to stand shoulder to shoulder in the EU on this matter in order to safeguard international law and to ensure a future for the UN.
I think that Great Britain and Spain , specifically , should be called upon to show that they too join with the EU in rejecting war .
Is it at all conceivable that the United States would install a Shia Muslim government in Iraq , reminiscent of the government in neighbouring Iran ?
Could one imagine the United States allowing the Kurds their independence ?
If the intention is to disarm Iraq , then that is the role assigned - rightly - to the weapons inspectors .
There is of course also the alternative of strengthening democracy in Iraq by removing the sanctions , other than those concerned with chemical and other weapons , including weapons of mass destruction .
We also have another task .
In conclusion , I want to state that we must urge Saddam Hussein to cooperate with the weapons inspectors so that we avoid a war .
I believe that the way forward is through democracy , development and cooperation .
I do not , however , believe for one moment that a war is the correct solution to the problem .
I , for my part , do not .
Nor do I entertain any doubts that a war would be a unique opportunity to test approximately 20 new weapons systems , as well as being good for the American arms industry .
So must Israel too , moreover , and I anxiously await the relevant demands on the part of the United States and the EU.
Let us not forget that the United States was once an enthusiastic supporter of Saddam Hussein and supplied him with some of his conventional weapons .
A war , on the other hand , could have completely unpredictable consequences .
It would fuel increased hatred towards the United States and the West and create a breeding ground for further terrorism .
There has been no success in improving the lives of the Afghan people , and there would scarcely be any success , either , in improving the lot of the Iraqis .
At a time when people 's education is largely left to mullahs and the indoctrination they practise , what , I wonder , would happen if the United States were to use only 10 % of the money expected to be spent on the war on providing the Arab world with , for example , free schools ?
War would be a short-sighted and anything but long-term solution .
Mr President ,
