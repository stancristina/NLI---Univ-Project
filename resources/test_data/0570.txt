I mention this in order to emphasise that the course of events was prescribed from the moment resolving the Cyprus problem became expedient and in the interests of the ΕU rather than of the Cypriot people .
It is therefore no paradox that the Annan plan tramples over earlier UN resolutions and twin-community agreements , establishing a peculiar , so-called confederation of a state , unique in the annals of international law and partitioned under a foreign protectorate .
The accidents are directly linked to the unaccountability which prevails , especially in the second registers of the Members States of the EU and on ships sailing under flags of convenience .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am delighted to be taking part in your debate today on economic policy and employment policy .
Streamlining has resulted not only in the update of the economic policy and employment policy coordination circuits of the European Union , but also in stronger complementarity and cohesion between these two basic procedures .
Within this framework , as there are no important developments , the three-year guidelines must remain stable this year .
Emphasis was placed in the 2004 update on incorporating the 10 new countries within the framework of the coordination of our policies .
This package of policies focuses on the contribution which economic policies can make towards achieving the Lisbon objectives .
The reasons for continuing the existing strategy and for achieving progress are obvious .
Of course , I have taken note of what Mrs Randzio-Plath said earlier about concerns about recovery and growth and Mrs Hermange 's comments in today 's publication about the stagnation in the economy and growth .
In the first evaluation of the application of the present broad guidelines in January , the Commission recognised that some progress had been made .
The economic challenges which the new Member States face do not differ materially from those which the current Member States face , they are just bigger .
As far as the 2004 guidelines for employment policies are concerned , I should like first of all to thank the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , and in particular the rapporteur , Mrs Hermange , for the dynamic way in which they prepared the European Parliament 's opinion on the guidelines .
I shall refer very briefly to the Commission proposal for the 2004 guidelines for employment .
This reform emphasised the medium-term approach and the definition of a framework policy which would take account of the diversity which prevails in the enlarged European Union .
This means that these recommendations must be at the epicentre of the national action plans submitted by the Member States , both the current fifteen and the new Member States , in the autumn of 2004 .
The employment guidelines and the Luxembourg procedure in general are very important in achieving this objective , which is why the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs always examines them with close interest .
It affects all sectors of economic policy , of social policy , of education policy , of vocational training , of transparency , of the fight against tax evasion and of undeclared work .
We also note that the countries in which there is no proper coordination have the worst performance records in the field of increasing employment .
It would appear that this issue , however necessary everyone considers it to be , is not easy .
The Union does not have primary responsibility on this matter nor , unfortunately , does it acquire it under the new draft Constitution .
Unfortunately , we cannot also say the same of the management of the real economy .
Growth rates have remained low and unemployment has remained at correspondingly high levels .
There are , of course , two ways .
It is time we returned to more logical principles , to a mixed economy like that which served us so well in the post-war years .
If we could find a new alliance of social forces , then we could really bring the European economy back to its old levels .
I do not think that anyone will disagree with this conclusion .
We therefore need to safeguard the continuation of both packages of guidelines in accordance with the principle of streamlining .
Careful monitoring of these procedures on your part , in close contact with your counterparts in the national parliaments , is the to success , especially within the framework of the interim review of the Lisbon strategy .
I should like once again to thank the rapporteurs and the Members of the European Parliament for the constructive way in which they expressed their concerns .
We consider that this is extremely dangerous and destructive to beekeeping , precisely because honey is primarily a quality agricultural product .
We are categorically against the cultivation and movement of GMOs and we shall continue to fight for a total ban on them , because we do not consider anything to be a foregone conclusion .
Various forms of training and informal types of learning are taking precedence over qualifications acquired through systematic education .
In the name of competitiveness and productivity , the aim is to reduce labour costs or non-wage costs , for which read step up exploitation and overturn social security rights .
These policies have not solved and cannot solve the unemployment problem , nor do they establish rights to safeguard the right to full/stable employment , because the real causes lie in the laws by which capitalism itself moves and operates .
We condemn the endeavour to reduce the resources available for social and regional cohesion , however fake these objectives may have proven to be , and to increase resources to serve plans to wage war on and persecute the peoples of the ΕU and third countries .
We are against reflecting in future
