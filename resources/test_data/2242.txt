general public that we are playing off these aims against each other ?
Making ourselves poorer in this way would not help the poor to become richer .
The participants of the World Social Forum did not wish to play the game that we see the European Council , the Commission and a great many Members of this House playing time and time again ; looking askance at the USA whilst talking up their own policies .
It is safe to say that if Mr Ackermann of Deutsche Bank – a company that can certainly be considered a global player – had read this recommendation , he would not have announced a return on capital of 16 % in the same breath as the loss of over 6 000 jobs .
In both cases we are also struggling to give the public what it wants .
I wish you the best of luck in ensuring that the decisions you take over coming months stand up in court .
I am also firmly convinced that unless the Commission speeds up the procedures for assessing internationally comparable best practice models , we run the risk of having to submit a negative final or interim report in four years ’ time .
I will restrict my comments to the report as adopted .
I urge you to support the report before you if you wish to see greater stability , growth and employment , and if you wish to see compliance with European law and with the Treaty .     Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , a majority of the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs agreed on a largely balanced report , even if Mr Goebbels is distancing himself from that report today .
The members of the ALDE Group on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs tabled an amendment on the necessary structural reforms in the Member States .
Quite the opposite !
Commissioner Almunia , your predecessor , the Spanish Socialist Mr Solbes , assured this House on several occasions that the Stability and Growth Pact is sufficiently flexible , and I am bound to agree with him .
You know very well that the Economic Policy Guidelines are the most tedious document to emerge from Brussels year after year .
Although they give cyclical problems as their excuse , they have failed to make the necessary structural reforms .
Particularly in Germany and France , which are major states with an excessively high government activity rate , high taxes and overly complex social systems , reforms are a prerequisite for economic growth .
Before the euro existed , the market punished highly indebted states in an open and easily understandable way , by means of high interest rates for government borrowing , high inflation rates and devaluation .
However , in order not to upset the sequence that has now been established , there is a proposal that for each year a city from one of the new Member States should be added in , so as to create a balance .
According to the 1999 decision on the European Capital of Culture , the objective of the programme is to highlight the wealth and variety of European cultures – as well as what they have in common – and to contribute towards better mutual understanding on the part of Europe’s citizens .
I would simply ask that in future the jury should pay more attention to what might be called the beacon effect of these cities .
I can very well imagine that it would be possible for each country whose turn it is to nominate at least two cities .
Legislating on the basis of panic mongering is surely not the way to go and I cannot take this seriously .
To do that you need to promote science and research , and to draw the correct conclusions from your findings .
I would therefore like to table it once again as an oral amendment .
Mr President , Commissioner , both Parliament’s Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety and a large number of NGOs believe that the European Union’s Natura 2000 programme is in grave danger .
They are full of ‘can’s’ , ‘should’s ’ and ‘could’s’ , which is by no means adequate , or at least not in our opinion , and indeed we are all aware of where such language gets us .
This programme is not about the environment ; it is designed to make a public nuisance of itself .     Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to join previous speakers in congratulating the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety .
The Commission is now proposing that money spent on these commitments should come from existing EU funds .
No further reductions should be made to this large area , and I therefore believe that separate and ample funding would be the best solution .     Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Natura 2000 is an extremely ambitious programme that has been in existence for a great many years .
It would be all too easy to paint a black-and-white picture of nightmare scenarios , but we should not forget that we have succeeded in making enormous progress in various fields relating to environmental quality .
The Italian Government recently banned smoking in virtually all indoor spaces in Italy , and a wave of indignation swept through the country ; yet there can be no doubt that the ban has had a positive impact .
Basic training is the fundamental element , but it does not interfere in any way with systems of advanced training .
There are , however , two points in the report which my group rejects .
As I said , the rapporteur has presented a very good proposal , and for that I thank him .
