The Common Agricultural Policy has been a European success story , and we want to keep it that way .
The future lies with our young farmers and with agricultural practices which are sustainable and protect the environment .
We must lend our full support to these objectives .
Mr President , on behalf of my group I would like to welcome the compromise resolution which we have just passed .
A strong and united voice calling unequivocally for a moratorium on the use of depleted uranium weapons is a positive step forward , even if it does not go as far as we would have liked .
The Greens and EFA were calling for a complete ban on the production , export and use of depleted uranium weapons and we believe that we have a legal as well as a moral basis for doing so .
The UN Convention of October 1980 banned the use of certain indiscriminate weapons ; the 1996 resolution of the Sub-Commission on Human Rights also explicitly condemned depleted uranium weapons because of their non-discriminatory character .
The use of these weapons has already , therefore , been condemned in international law .
We would also have been more reassured if the resolution had included our concerns about the methodology which is being used to assess the risks of depleted uranium .
A growing number of scientists are now challenging the conventional methodology , which is based on doses of external radioactive rays rather than internally ingested or inhaled particles .
Research shows that deaths from leukaemia resulting from the Chernobyl explosion have been one hundred times more than predicted by the relevant radiological protection boards , which have based their predictions on external rays .
The enormity of this error conceals the fact that even very low doses of radiation , like that from depleted uranium , can in fact have devastating health impacts .
It is therefore essential that we get this methodology right or else all the tests and screening in the world will be simply worthless .
Finally , I would like to refer to the report on the front page of last week 's European Voice , which proclaims that the new EU rapid reaction force is apparently planning to use depleted uranium weapons .
Now remember this is a humanitarian force , which is planning to use a weapon that will leave an enormous legacy of cancers among the very civilians it is supposed to be there to protect .
This is nothing short of scandalous and must be overturned .
.
The British delegation of Labour MEPs welcomes the action taken by NATO member states to investigate the causes of deaths and illnesses suffered by troops who served in the Balkans .
We believe that consideration of the use of depleted uranium should be based on scientific fact .
We note that as yet there is no evidence to link depleted uranium and ill health suffered either by troops or civilians .
For that reason , we do not believe that it is appropriate at this time to call for a moratorium on the use of depleted uranium weapons .
Mr President , last year I attended the 56th UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva and last week , I attended the Human Rights Contact Group : much more needs to be done and , if anything , the situation is worsening across the world .
The promotion and defence of human rights is a high priority for the European Union and remains one of the fundamental principles of the Union .
Indeed , I believe the concept of human rights should inform everything we do in the name of democracy because a negative human rights situation is often caused or exacerbated by the absence of democracy and inefficient and corrupt government structures .
Human rights do not exist in isolation , neither should they be considered in abstract .
They are the fundamental rights of all people regardless of who they are , where or to whom they are born .
Yet as we speak in this Chamber , the human rights of men , women and children are being violated .
This is why the Council and the Member States must work for the universal ratification of the main human rights instruments available to all countries , in particular , the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , the Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural rights , the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women , the Convention on the Rights of the Child , already mentioned , the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination and the extremely important Convention against Torture .
We also call for immediate measures to be taken to protect homosexual persons from degrading and inhuman treatment to which they are still subjected : because of their sexuality , they still face the death penalty in certain parts of the world .
We also call on the EU to support the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the other international organisations and NGOs in the fight against repression of the independent media already referred to by Lord Bethell and the repression of journalists and writers and to urge all states to end censorship , to protect the right of access to official information and to stop the restriction on access to modern information technology , often a saviour to people being repressed .
We also call upon the Council and the UN Commission on Human Rights to give full support to the drafting of the International Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances .
Once again , and I hope not in vain , we call for the abolition of the death penalty .
Countries can , will and should be named and shamed , but in this House and together with the Council and the UN Commission , we must redouble our efforts
