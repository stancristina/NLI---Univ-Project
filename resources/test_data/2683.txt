farm exports to increase by USD 2 billion over the next five years as Chinese tariff cuts begin to take effect .
No wonder they are already gloating over bigger , better and more consistent markets .
But while Cargill is so delighted that its profits will rise while Chinese self-sufficiency in agricultural goods falls , the picture is a good deal less optimistic for the people of China themselves .
It has been estimated that increased competition from cheap agricultural imports could mean that about 400 million rural Chinese will no longer be needed on farms by 2005 .
It is almost impossible to conceive of such a huge figure or to think about the social dislocation and misery that will cause .
The Commission is offering technical support to the Chinese in order to help them with the enormous economic restructuring which accession to the WTO will bring .
What I would like to see is an equal concern to help with the almost inconceivable social restructuring which will inevitably follow in its wake with - I repeat - 400 million rural farmers out of a job .
Mr Lamy has been quoted as saying that the bilateral negotiations between the EU and China yielded 96 % of what the EU was demanding .
Would he like to estimate what percentage of success the Chinese people will get from these same negotiations ?
Mr President , on a point of order , when I inquired this morning about the time of this debate I was told it would start shortly after 3 o'clock .
When I came for this debate at 3 o'clock I was told it would be taking place later , towards 5 o'clock .
Clearly there is pressure on our agenda today .
I wish to put forward a proposal that might relieve pressure on the end of today 's agenda , namely , the debate previewed for the late payments directive - the report of the conciliation procedure with the Council .
This is an issue which is now entirely without contention .
Everybody supports this matter .
The rapporteur , the shadow rapporteur and the chairman of the committee would all support a suggestion that this be turned into a vote without debate .
That would end pressure on the agenda right at the end of this evening .
Possibly we could have a vote on it now .
Question No 7 by (H-0454/00 ) : Subject : Human rights : Egypt Further to the European Parliament resolution of 20 January 2000 on the violence in Upper Egypt , what steps has the Council taken to ensure that the Coptic Christian community in Egypt is fairly and justly treated and , specifically following recent events , that those arrested at El-Kosheh were offered a fair trial and , indeed , that the arrests were made with no element of religious discrimination ?
I wish to thank the President-in-Office for his reply .
I would say this question was prompted by the very large number of letters I receive from constituents about this particular issue .
It is perhaps the issue I have received more letters about in the last year than any other .
It strikes me from what he said that it is very strange that after several of the Coptic Christians had been attacked and disturbed by the others , that it was only Coptic Christians who were arrested .
The President-in-Office said in his reply that the Council will remind the Egyptians of their responsibilities and wait until they have signed the association agreement and can bring an institutionalised political dialogue to bear .
But why does he not use the signing of this agreement as a basis on which to force the Egyptians to come to a more equable , reasonable and non-discriminatory approach to their Coptic Christian citizens ?
Mr President-in-Office , from what you have just said , is there therefore an understanding or an expectation in E-11 that after they have had an informal discussion about the euro in Euro-11 , they will all vote the same way when they go to Ecofin , even if they disagreed originally ?
Is there a procedural expectation that all eleven will vote the same way in the formal decision-making in Ecofin ?
Up in the gallery , listening to you and me , are visitors .
Everything is open here in Parliament .
They can hear what we are discussing and agree or disagree .
But the Council of Ministers meets in secret .
Maybe you can slide out of this example and say it is a Member State talking to the Commission and they send them a letter .
Nevertheless these matters are done in secret .
If we - you and I - want the public to understand and agree with the decisions we take , surely you agree with me that it must be done in public ?
Question No 10 by (H-0460/00 ) : Subject : Tibet and the World Bank Is the Council aware of the World Bank 's ' China Western Poverty Project ' proposal to move tens of thousands of non-Tibetan farmers into Amdo , thereby breaching international law concerning population transfers to occupied territories ?
Is it also aware that this project has been condemned by the German and United States Governments but supported by the British Government ?
Will the Council press the World Bank to abandon the scheme and the British Government to withdraw its support ?
Can I say firstly that I was astonished by the Minister 's response to my honourable friend on the subject of human rights in Egypt .
If Europe does not stand for human rights then I do not know what it does stand for .
I would like to test him , if I may , on Tibet because Tibet has now been illegally occupied by China for many years .
