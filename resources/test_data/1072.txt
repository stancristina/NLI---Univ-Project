has a dual significance : it contains a political message for that country and it allows us room for manoeuvre within heading 4 on foreign policy .
We have established peace as our rule and a shared destiny as the solution and this is enshrined in a Union based on common values , respect for human rights , good governance and the rule of law .
This is the leap we have taken and now we have to complete it by ensuring that we genuinely have a shared destiny and solidarity .
I believe that would be the icing on the cake to conclude that important ceremony .
There is absolutely no doubt that successive enlargements lead us to the question : how far ?
Thirdly , enlargement is a challenge in terms of combating different forms of organised crime , such as terrorism , human trafficking or drug trafficking .
This is an unprecedented action which constitutes a serious attack on the budgetary competences of our House and the Interinstitutional Agreement of 1999 .
Madam President I would firstly like to thank Mr Morillon for the efforts he has made on this report in order to bring together the differing points of view .
This is a great threat to security .
This also comes at a time characterised by the 11 September attacks and the Iraq crisis .
Finally , Madam President , President Aznar has not put pressure on anybody and neither would the dignity of the Presidents of Mexico or Chile have tolerated any type of pressure .
I am referring to the differing positions maintained by the governments of the 15 countries within the United Nations Security Council with regard to the conflict in Iraq .
But in the European Union , although the problem is a common one , the solutions have been different , because the Union has neither a common foreign policy nor a common defence policy .
Mr President , thank you for your reply .
You replied that you appealed for human rights to be respected when you met with the Mediterranean countries .
Is the Presidency of the Council ?
Is the European Union not duty bound to prevent conflicts and crises ?
President-in-Office of the Council , do you consider it appropriate to adopt measures to prevent sexual harassment in the Armed Forces ?
In Ireland for example , of the 60 women in the Armed Forces interviewed , 28 had been subjected to sexual harassment .
I think both the approach and the scope of the Liese report are excellent .
As previously explained , donation and transplant procedures rely on solidarity .
I therefore believe Amendment No 6 provides a sensible solution to the problem .
Commissioner , we are all wondering why that was so .
If the Commission really believes that a maximum permitted dose of cyclamates of 250 mg/l is more appropriate it should withdraw its initial proposal .
Furthermore , the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration stated in a press release on the publication of this study that the RDA study was based on safe lifetime intake .
The rights of the indigenous people are again being violated .
Others sentenced include Omar Rodríguez , a photographer , who received a 27-year sentence and another journalist , Víctor Rolando Arroyo , sentenced to 26 years in prison .
To paraphrase Oswaldo Payá , they feel no hate in their hearts as they fight , but no fear of their oppressors either .
That individual , Mr James Cason , has drawn on substantial financial resources to destabilise Cuban institutions .
I believe it is regrettable that the majority of Members who are being so severe on Cuba today should have voted last year against the resolution calling for diplomatic relations with Israel to be broken .
Mr President , the repressive process set in train with impunity against Cuban citizens in Cuba has shown up the Castro dictatorship in its true colours once again .
We are called on to assure those fighting for the rights of all Cubans that we stand shoulder to shoulder with them and that their fight is our fight also .
The Cuban authorities could well be justified in anticipating the danger of a qualitative change in the aggression they have been subjected to .
It will be even more difficult to convince Cubans to change if the increasing provocation instigated by Mr Cason , who is in charge of the interests of the United States in Cuba , is not condemned whilst Cubans are criticised .
Nonetheless , I disagree with all it does not say .
A number of questions were raised , yet we have not even heard the Commission call for those detained to be released .
In addition , under the provisions of the state of emergency , many people have been arrested recently in connection with anti-war demonstrations .
It charts the way forward clearly and defines the appropriate instruments to enable European citizens to be more involved in the Community they belong to , as indeed they should be .
I would nonetheless point out to you that we are working within the International Maritime Organisation to increase the figure concerned , which at present is absolutely ridiculous , to EUR 1 000 million .
My group is therefore in favour of a debate and of statements by the Council and the Commission , but not in favour of a resolution , at least until such time as this Parliament is capable of agreeing upon a resolution .
Udalbitza has enhanced the national construction of our country , favouring local representatives ' joint action in fields such as culture , the environment , social welfare , economic development , land organisation , sports and , of course , the promotion of the Basque language
