These effects may be toxic , infective , allergenic , carcinogenic , and indeed they may be acute or chronic , reversible or not , local or systemic .
Indeed , if we bear in mind that we are not at risk from just one harmful factor but from many simultaneously , then we can surmise that their cumulative effect may even have an impact on the resistance , ageing and life expectancy of the human organism .
This is bound to bring action which will include the dissemination of the data , and information of the public and consumers , as mentioned in Amendments Nos 10 , 14 and 16 .
The field on which the programme focuses is in itself a particularly important area in which to adopt Community measures .
Since these diseases have to be combated by a combination of efforts , the programme we are voting on should be promoted .
To achieve the programme 's objectives , we consider that the budget for the period from 1999 to 2003 should be set at ECU 14 million , and not ECU 6.5 million as proposed by the Council .
All the rest that was said a little while ago by one of our young colleagues is unacceptable , being not devil 's advocacy but a defence of crimes and criminals .
It is at the heart of the civilised West .
It is therefore important - and this is my first comment - that according to the Commission 's estimates , for the period we are talking about 880 000 jobs are being created in the Objective 2 areas .
The number could have been even larger , but clearly it could also have been smaller .
Now , as for the new programme period , we as the European People 's Party , I must tell you - although you know it already - have many doubts about the Commission 's effort to deal with the new Objective 2 and at the same time with the difficulties of industrial and rural areas which are facing problems of conversion .
And we also favour the Commission 's proposal for a safety net , in other words a maximum reduction of the order of 33 % for regions covered at present by Objectives 2 and 5B.
The main blame for that , however , may not lie with our colleague Mr Koch , but with the Commission and the Council .
Commissioner , it is not just safety conditions during transport that matter .
I wonder !
On the one hand , eutrophism in rivers , coastal areas and seawater , with all its consequences , and on the other hand a danger to public health through drinking water , because as we all know , nitrates are reduced in our organism to nitrites and nitrites transform haemoglobin to methaemoglobin .
I believe that the European Commission should monitor the implementation of the various directives more decisively , because it is not right that we should enjoy a good standard of living but not care about protecting the environment .
Not only was that commitment not honoured , but subsequent budgets , including the one for 1999 , have been adapted to the dictates of a phoney EMU and have bowed to decisions made by bankers .
Europe 's social cohesion and public health are again at risk .
Payment appropriations for the suppression of violence against children , young people and women - line B3-4109 - have been increased very little , from ECU 2 million to ECU 3 million .
Interpreters and conference technicians are also victims of the new budget , with the corresponding budget items cut by ECU 1.5 million .
Mr President , the European Union 's draft budget for 1999 is a particularly harsh and restrictive austerity budget , a budget dictated by the harsh financial policy imposed by progress towards EMU and the stability pact .
Farmers , mainly those in the South , working people , entrepreneurs in the small and medium-sized cottage industry sector , young people and pensioners have all reached the limits of their endurance .
They cannot cope with still more austerity .
The common agricultural policy and its development , the issue of the Structural Funds and the efforts towards convergence , the European Union 's foreign policy and the way it has been financed without bureaucratic impediments at times and has therefore been able to be effective on the few occasions when it has been used ; all this shows that the European Union 's budget is basically a policy instrument .
The worrying thing is not the austerity of the budget as such , which will naturally increase awareness that excesses must be avoided and that appropriations must be allocated and utilised sensibly .
The current budget demonstrates that , and further proof is to be found in the recent agreement on legal bases which already applies to the budget under review .
So austerity is not an end in itself .
In the past , when we were drawing up the budget , we started off with the policy we wished to implement .
We will have somehow to reconsider how to restore to the EU budget its true political role .
It constitutes a risk to the stability and security of the entire region , and threatens to affect the European Union itself if the disturbances spread to the south .
We are only too aware that fanatics will always react against such agreements and try to sabotage them , but this is all the more reason to persist .
The European Union must exert every possible diplomatic pressure to back the agreement achieved and demand respect for democratic principles and human rights , together with the reforms mentioned in connection with Kosovo .
If we hold our line
