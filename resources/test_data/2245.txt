the state of emergency and no longer to obstruct opponents .     .
We would have been able to make it clear that the designation of – and I quote – ‘a close monitoring system ’ is something we emphatically reject , because for many Members of this House , it smacks too much of Romania and Bulgaria being under guardianship , and hence , of discrimination between the Member States , with which we want nothing to do .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , the central question in this debate is what is now the best way of ensuring that the reforms , particularly in the area of justice and in the fight against corruption and organised crime , are sustained beyond 2007 .
That is why some of my group think it justified that the pressure should be kept on until the very last minute , until 1 January 2008 , in order to guarantee that all countries meet those criteria .
If , on the other hand , you believe that the EU will look the other way , you will be penalised .     .
As my group chairman has already said , we assume , hope , and expect that both the countries under discussion today will be able to join on 1 January of next year .
I am convinced that the talks that are still underway about a number of problems will reach a successful conclusion .
I do not know who had the wisdom to compile this agenda , but I do not think it does Parliament any favours to hold a discharge debate about the European institutions at this time of day .
There have been a number of developments since then .
We would also appreciate it , in a different connection , if the Commission were to identify risk areas in the budget , namely what the high-risk and low-risk areas are .
In the discharge report , a specific request was made for two reports , in the first instance about the management of the funds granted by the European Union to the UN bodies .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I have three points to make .
My third point concerns the Committee of the Regions .
However , I think that we will see an overwhelming majority from all the political groups behind his proposal not to grant discharge tomorrow , and I welcome that .
Another paragraph states that Julian Priestley’s decision to stop paying the rent is actually a breach of the contract .
The second compelling point in his report is that he wants the finance ministers of the Member States to sign for any spending themselves .
This is something that receives our unqualified support .
Whether this is to be in Strasbourg , Luxembourg or Brussels is something that we can discuss in due course .
The central message of the report , which it is to be hoped we will adopt tomorrow , is that state aid should remain an exception .
It is not , after all , a matter of doubt that state aid can distort the market to such an extent that it can , in fact , hinder developments in the area of innovation , and so the proposed balancing test in your document strikes me as a fine tool , and the emphasis on assessing results of past aid is in line with Parliament’s position , which has also been adopted in Mr Hökmark’s report .
I double-checked , and the text really does state that the percentage of permitted aid can be increased if a competitor from a non-EU country receives more subsidy .
Commissioner , you are known as someone who always takes the opinion of this House very seriously .
That is true of the 112 system , but certainly also true of the eCall system , as my fellow Members have already indicated .
Mr President , I should like to add a new paragraph 5a to read : ‘Expects that the results of the review of unknown bank accounts related to Commission activities launched by the Commission in October 2005 will be made known completely to Parliament and be followed up’ .
Adapting to that regime is not the solution , nor is waging war with it .
Finally , it defies belief that Greece , a Member State , still receives maximum agricultural subsidies even though it has not met the requirement of fully introducing the IACS for more than ten years .     .
In so doing , this Committee has failed miserably as a monitoring body , and it is for that reason that I shall not be voting in favour of this discharge .     .
This is about funds that all Europeans together have to raise for fulfilling useful tasks , and those funds should not be wasted .
There are 175 villages largely under water , and tens of thousands of people have fled .
My second comment concerns the role of national parliaments .
Perfect … or at least that is what I think , for I do not know .
No profits on the back of people who are worried about their weight or health .
Nor will the sugary lollypop by adding vitamin A. The compromise rejects health claims on alcohol , which will only be allowed where the alcohol percentage or calorie level is reduced .
I would express the hope and expectation that this legislation will contribute to better food and better health .
Moreover , I have serious doubts about the very influential part to be played by the European Food Safety Agency , the independence of which is regularly called into question .
As for the food and health claims , I should like to say that I will back the result that has been achieved during negotiations .
