Both of them deal with issues - the Middle East peace process and the Euro-Mediterranean process following the Barcelona Declaration - which are currently deadlocked , as colleagues have pointed out .
Otherwise its role will simply be to beat the human rights drum : a noble role , without a doubt , but utterly useless in terms of influencing proceedings , unless our words are followed by deeds .
I would rather refer to the limitations of the instruments in the Barcelona process .
Obviously , if we are in agreement from one side of this House to the other , it means that this approach , and this one alone , is the right one .
That would be quite feasible , but let us confine ourselves to tackling more serious problems , namely those highlighted by Mrs Napoletano and myself .
The safety standards of these power plants must be inspected by an independent authority recognised by the IAEA and the EU.
For over four years the Commission , Parliament and the Member States ' finance ministers have been telling the public and businesses that there would be a change of scene in the Community as from the landmark date of 1 January 1999 , in that the cost of moving currency - the number-one tool of unification - would disappear .
Unless the banks start working towards a common currency rather than a national one , it will be hard for us to convince the public , business leaders and small traders to work in a market which - as you rightly say , Commissioner - must become not just a single market but an internal market .
It was nevertheless decided to press ahead , without applying the principle of subsidiarity , bearing in mind that other sectors - such as textiles and clothing - had branding problems needing to be tackled gradually over time .
We are told at one and the same time that production should be switched and that milk quotas cannot be increased , that under the COM in wine vineyards cannot be replanted or extended , and so on in all the other farm sectors .
It really is disconcerting that yet again , one year after we last met here to discuss the COM , we are sticking to our guns and saying the same things .
Smokers will not stop smoking , and let us not forget it , but woe betide us if we halt tobacco growing : unemployment in Europe would rise , more or less , by another 1 380 000 .
Consequently , our line in tomorrow 's vote will be to stress the crucial nature of the text being adopted : I mean to say that it is essential to lay down certain general provisions , on which to base specific rules governing various matters of a contractual nature .
The Member States must continue to pursue the objective of achieving budget equilibrium by reducing deficits but without increasing public spending .
We have an instrument , the euro , which is binding and compelling and is forcing us towards a new kind of cohesion as compared with the past .
To achieve that , I believe that the economic policy guidelines must be coordinated with employment strategy , and therefore the euro is - and remains at this historic moment in the construction of Europe - the main and most appropriate response .
However , events in Cermis also show us that we need to reconsider and act to change the rules contained in the 1951 London Convention , so that tragedies of this kind - which would certainly be more likely were there to be a general feeling of impunity - are prevented in the future , and to guarantee that there would , in any event , be no obstacles in the way of the investigations and judicial proceedings against elements of NATO armed forces that violate the laws of the countries in which they are stationed .
If the pilot was right , then in any event , the responsibility of those who failed to update such important maps ought to be established .
Madam President , the Cermis incident is without doubt a tragic episode , and the impression of US justice which Italy and the rest of Europe have been given has certainly left us with a bitter taste in the mouth .
Particularly unjustifiable , however , is the apathy of a court-martial that is incapable of guaranteeing that justice will be done , taking refuge behind international agreements , in this case the London Convention which dates back to 1951 and now needs , as a matter of urgency , to be brought into line with changing times and international political reality .
There are two things we should be talking about here : about condemnation - condemnation of the action of those pilots who play at cowboys in the skies , risking the lives of others - and above all censure of the verdict of the American court-martial , which is failing to give our people , our nations , justice .
The first point relates to the universal moratorium on executions .
In this respect , we are calling for this session in Geneva to be the last at which a resolution is passed on the moratorium , and for this year 's General Assembly to vote for the universal abolition of the death penalty .
On this matter , I am afraid that we must recognise that as in Kosovo , there are limits to the capacity for suffering and acceptance both of the Tibetan people and of all the people of China , and that we will once again arrive too late .
Given the difficulties that Macedonia is facing , this is truly staggering .
But this also
