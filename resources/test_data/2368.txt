, if not with complicity , at least with tolerance .
Substantial legal changes in the definition of violence and its prevention should be considered .
It is a very powerful instrument , as we know , and the important thing is that this powerful instrument should not contravene certain principles .
I should like to express our group 's support for the Azzolini report , since the cultural field encourages direct and indirect employment , promoting the survival and creation of small and medium-sized enterprises connected with the cultural sector , and offering prospects for the creation of employment .
As he correctly reminded us , the appeal decision will probably be ratified on 25 September , and then the Commission has a month to decide what to do - whether to implement the decision or propose some type of compensation .
I repeat , disappointment is not enough .
Unfortunately , these actions have not been successful in the way that was intended .
However , we are not here today to feel sorry for ourselves .
The Commission now has some time - only a little - and several possible courses of action .
We must prevent the weight of the North American multinationals , whose only aim is to obtain high economic benefits , from weakening and destroying a sector with as many social repercussions as the banana sector .
It is a political problem ; and the problem that now arises in the case of the banana is none other than the weakness of the European Union against the United States .
They do not defend the interests of European consumers , nor of the ACP countries , nor even those of the small Latin American producers .
Mr President , I realize that , because of the delicacy of the issue , Commissioner Fischler has been extremely cautious this afternoon .
If current attempts to establish this regime in the name of free trade lead to the loss of the small 30 % of the Community market which is all that remains to Community producers and ACP countries which have traditionally exported to the Union , then we will have done away with free trade .
We are not talking about whether there should or should not be nuclear power , nor are we deciding the energy policy of Ukraine ( which only the Ukrainians have the right to do ) .
That is the reality , but that is not what we are talking about .
Do the Ukrainians want to take risks ?
It is also true that the Chernobyl sarcophagus needs $ 700 million - it has been an effort for the Tacis programme to contribute $ 100 million .
Something I try to encourage in my discussions with these countries is that they should not just use the aid for strictly economic purposes , but should also use it for cultural matters .
So the current position has had the backing of Parliament , the Council and the Commission .
That amendment did not get enough votes and that is why it has not been included in the directive .
At the moment I cannot tell you what the outcome of the study will be .
Mr Commissioner , what is being presented to the public and the European Commission as a strategic alliance between ARBED and CSI is really a strange privatization operation , or absorption .
It is not that there was no competition from other companies .
If the United States does not ratify what has been agreed , and if other countries such as Korea continue with discussions about shipyard aid , then we will commit suicide by not compensating for a control of subsidies which we cannot exercise in other countries .
Mediterranean farmers need you to give them these guarantees of future prospects , as you do for other parts of Europe .
The increased productivity yield per hour worked means there is a decrease in the number of jobs .
Sir Leon has reminded us of the conditions , but I would like to stress the two basic ones .
I should like to say , Mr President , that our political group has always rejected the Helms-Burton Act .
Bearing in mind that when the European Commission signed this agreement with the Clinton Administration the time limit was 15 October , it would perhaps be a good idea if the Commission could tell us the position of the United States Congress as regards the amendment of Title 4 .
Furthermore , Sir Leon says that investments are not going to be prohibited , but inhibited .
Mr President , this is not an attempt to reopen the debate but rather , as my colleague has said , to ask the Commissioner to be more precise , as far as he is able .
Madam President , as regards the escalation of raging barbarity which we are seeing in Algeria , it must be remembered that this is also a question of a struggle for political and economic power .
Firstly , as regards that reaction to interference , we should remind them that the Euro-Mediterranean Agreements do not involve the European Union alone .
Next , there is a pre-condition for dialogue with the terrorists - because people are still calling them men of violence - who are murdering the population on a massive scale .
It became so great that France really and sincerely believed that it was another part of its own territory .
We should recognize that now .
Also , of course , to talk with all the political forces represented in that parliament , and perhaps also to make contact with other political forces able to switch soon enough from an attitude of violence to one of moderation and peace - for that violent attitude not to be thought of as irreversible .
