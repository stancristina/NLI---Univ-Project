dealt with in the discussion of Article 255 .
The Commission is unable , however , to approve Amendments 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 16 , 18 , 22 , 27 , 29 and 30 .
I ask this question in view of the lack of confidence in agriculture felt by more and more consumers .
The company , which is called Siljanet and whose innovator is Anders Lindberg , has introduced a form of data labelling for which a patent has now been applied and which enables meat to be traced back to the individual farm .
I just want to inform Commissioner Verheugen that , last autumn in Mr Morillon ' s report on Turkey , the European Parliament called upon Turkey to withdraw its occupying troops from northern Cyprus .
Thank you for your answer , Commissioner .
Clearly , it is too early to draw any conclusions , but I believe some progress could certainly be made both on cooperation concerning language learning methods and on the preservation of unusual languages .
Mr President , I want to begin by congratulating the President on having handled the first part of this discussion so well that we do , in fact , have an actual document to discuss .
That is something we are really all agreed on .
That is what this directive is about .
It is not only , therefore , a question of tightening up limit values but , to just as great an extent , a matter of our people ' s health .
It is we who have the opportunity to set the pace if 314 Members have the courage to take up a definite position tomorrow in favour of the more ambitious alternative .
The Council ' s limit values are not as far-reaching .
Nothing would remain of the high ambitions entertained .
Minimum environmental requirements are needed in order to create common ground rules .
Thank you , Mr President .
Acidification is still a problem to which we cannot avoid drawing attention .
Once again , we see the conflict between industry , employment and the environment rear its head .
Many who have previously been environmental campaigners are transformed into preservers of the status quo in their own countries and regions and embrace the old coal-fired power stations in their home districts .
In this connection , it must also be pointed out that the ceilings and figures presented by the Commission were based upon countries ' own reporting to the Commission .
When , now , the Council contributes its own points of view , it will come as no surprise if , this time too , a much more meagre result is arrived at , a result very close to the figures in the Gothenburg Protocol .
We also choose to exceed the critical loads and levels over a further several hundred thousand hectares of land .
Mr President , the acidification of forests , fields and watercourses is the single biggest environmental problem in my own country .
That is why acid rain causes a lot of damage in Denmark , Sweden and Finland .
I would address all you MEPs from different Member States .
Many people in my own country with an interest in the environment are pinning their hopes on the European Union .
I cannot therefore support the proposal for EU taxes to combat emissions .
The situation in Russia would have been much better today if there had been no need to inherit the ill health and the environmental catastrophe left behind when the Communist system collapsed .
Parliament should therefore again be as ambitious in combating acidification as the Commission was in setting what have been called emission ceilings .
Mr President , the Commission ' s proposal for an Action Plan to increase energy efficiency is welcome .
As the rapporteur , I can , at the same time , see that the plan has many shortcomings in its original form .
Many people are doubtless aware that we have to change the direction of energy policy and reduce our considerable dependency on fossil fuels .
The reason , of course , is the lack of knowledge about what can be done .
If we put a corresponding amount of money into the rational use of energy , the investment is seen as being significantly more diffuse .
In my view , the Commission is too cautious in its assessments .
In the same way , it is important to use the tax system to promote energy-efficient vehicles and buildings , or equipment which contributes to the more rational use of energy .
Deregulation is excellent , but it has led to such low prices that , for example , problems involving counter-pressure have arisen .
Such a programme would be significantly impaired if the environmental aspects were not covered .
Nor must we forget countries in the vicinity of the EU.
Together with three other MEPs - Mrs McNally , Mr Turmes and Mrs van der Laan - I have therefore prepared an initiative called Energy Intelligent Europe , which has already been supported by many representatives of different political groups and Member States .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , ' I am delighted to see that the Commission has taken concrete steps to include European citizens in a debate that is going to determine the long-term future of the Union . '
Kurt Linderoos from Finland proposes that all EU citizens contact an additional fourteen people , one from every other Member State , to discuss the future of the EU.
Last week , Parliament ' s Vice President David Martin , the Prime Ministers of Sweden and Belgium and President Prodi launched the debate on the future of Europe
