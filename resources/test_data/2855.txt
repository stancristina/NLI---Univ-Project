Obviously , this relates to both the period during which the World Football Cup takes place and the period that follows : measures such as these cannot stop in July 2006 .
Another proposal that can be made relates to more in-depth contact with local governments , regional governments and town councils .
Madam President , I am about to conclude , and I apologise for the length of my speech , but there were 16 different points and I should not like it if one of the speakers were to say later on that I had not provided answers .
We will promote a programme in order to increase awareness of the phenomenon at European level .
There are , in fact , associations of female and male prostitutes ; one such association came here to Parliament in order to call for the recognition of their profession , beginning with the introduction of a Charter of Rights and of a declaration of principles .
Secondly , we need to introduce measures aimed at lessening the social costs of a relocation through actions designed to promote the training and reskilling of workers in the regions hit by restructuring .
To make good the economic and social development gaps in some regions by promoting methods that could cause a lack of development in other regions of Europe would therefore run counter to such an objective .
That is as good as privatising air and only letting people breathe if they have money .
In other words , we need to focus on young people and on education in schools .
At stake on this issue are all our values , our rights , and even the fate of peace and the survival of humanity .
In order to put good governance into practice and provide all Europeans with full citizenship , we should adopt a European Charter of consumer rights in the digital world – so-called e-rights – with shared principles and guidelines , defining a framework of citizens ’ rights .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to add my voice to that of my fellow Member , Mrs Gröner , in support of a vote on this Commission proposal that meets a need felt in all the countries of Europe , and not just by women .
Employment data also tell a story : Lisbon will only become a reality if increasing numbers of women have access to the employment market , not to mention the problems of a fall in the birth-rate and violence .
We believe that it is important for the European Union to retain an economic model that places at its centre respect for social clauses and the rights of workers in all parts of the world .
Good intentions are not , however , enough for Parliament ; we call for information on specific points .
This , Mr President and Mr Mandelson , is not what the free market is .     – Mr Mandelson , ladies and gentlemen , it is the same old story : having abolished all restrictions on the import of footwear products from the Far East and having caused such damage to the European and Italian industries in the sector , with the obvious consequences for employment , we are laying the foundations for definite risks in the future to small and medium-sized enterprises .
It is a question of emphases : the path between heaven and hell is a narrow one .
The application of anti-dumping measures has taken place with a sluggishness that has not been seen before , and above all anti-dumping duties are being proposed that are not sufficient to tackle a situation of unfair competition that the Commission itself defines as serious .
I would also point out that another fundamental request , which is the compulsory introduction of a label of origin for products entering the EU , has been dragging on for two years without the Member States being able to come to agreement .
It is also necessary to tackle the worrying increase in swap practices – in other words , anomalous movements of products with the aim of bypassing more stringent customs controls ( imports from Belgium have increased by an amount of 17.8 % , which is absolutely inexplicable ) .
Parliament has already expressed an opinion on minimum procedures , and we are waiting for the Council to go forward on this point .
First of all , I would like to point out that monitoring of the transposing of the law on the European arrest warrant will continue and that Parliament has at its disposal our evaluations on all the Member States , which since January includes Italy , with an additional report ; in June there will be another report .
I have already said this , but I say it again now : I find it strange that we have been able to reach agreement on transferring people from one country to another , while we have not succeeded in transferring the evidence , which is a considerably less significant element in terms of invasion of fundamental rights , and of mutual trust .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the question raises an important issue since it refers to funds for a project that is essential for us , specifically , a research project on the issue of crime .
Given that , from the data disseminated within the , it appears that the demographic increases in some sections , such as the Italian section , will be greater over the next few years than that of many other nationalities , is this not a factor that should lead the Commission to choose option B from among the alternatives cited ?     Mr Kallas , I return to the same issue : criterion F , of those adopted in October , stipulates that if a section exists in more
