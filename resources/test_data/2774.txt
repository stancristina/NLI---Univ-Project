We understand that , if one day Turkey enters the European Union , it will make the Union stronger , not weaker .
This has been advocated , not just by Mrs Oomen-Ruijten , the author of this motion for a resolution , which seems to me a very broad , very thorough , detailed proposal , an excellent basis to work on , I think , but by many of the participants here this evening : Mrs Corazza , Mrs Ludford , Mrs Keller , Mr Zahradil , many others have advocated sending a clear message to Turkey .
The glass can be half full or half empty .
Indeed , a good example of this solidarity is administrative cooperation on tax matters , which is a key element of the functioning of the Union .
We are therefore facing a major challenge and should come up with a decisive response .
The field of application is extended by moving from exchange of information upon request to automatic exchange .
I do not intend to provide an exhaustive commentary , and will focus on the main amendments .
Mr President , I should like to refer to the reasons why we go beyond established OECD standards concerning automatic exchange of information .
In other words , the fiscal sovereignty of Member States will be strengthened as more effective instruments for the implementation of their own tax system become available to them .
Finally , I must mention that these measures come at a most opportune moment , as the crisis has highlighted the dangers of a lack of transparency , transmission from certain countries to others , and the need for public stimuli .
The Figueruelas plant is in my region , Aragón , so this matter affects us directly .
We have raised these issues year after year and have been unable to make much progress .
The Commission and the European Parliament are going to play an essential role in all of these things , and we as the Council want the Commission to work hard .
Mr Barroso committed to 3 % investment in research and development .
Madam President , we are in an unprecedented situation in the euro area , because this is the first global financial crisis since the euro has been in existence .
It is , however , true that job creation is falling behind .
It should also be pointed out that the Eurogroup and Ecofin have managed the crisis well , and have also created a supervision structure for the financial system that is going to be debated in this House .
In the future - and this is another subject that will be dealt with on Thursday at the informal European Council meeting - there will have to be a policy of employability , which we call ' Europe 2020' , as a model of growth and creating quality jobs .
It is an obligation and it is one of the principles , one of the lines or ideas raised by the Spanish Presidency .
Firstly , I think that there has been a general confidence in the euro area during the debate .
There are currently 21 European Union countries that have been in this situation , which is the logical consequence of the essential intervention because , amongst other things , as I said before , in Europe there are social protection systems that mean that the most vulnerable people have to receive help from the public coffers .
Mr Bullmann mentioned the need for socio-political coordination , as did Mrs Podimata .
I am convinced that the initial foundations for this strategy are going to be laid at this immediate , very early Council meeting , which means that we want to act immediately and with political leadership in the European Union in this time of need .
If you recall , this was one of the first conclusions of the report that I presented here on behalf of the Commission in the first half of 2008 , before Lehman Brothers , on the first 10 years of the Economic and Monetary Union .
I do not know how quickly Mr Verhofstadt 's country asked the Commission to take action on budgetary matters , but I would like to remind him that there were elections in Greece in early October .
Moreover , in relation to the statistical problems , and in response to Mr Martin - as I think Mr Karas said - at the end of 2004 , I proposed to the Council on behalf of the Commission that we strengthen Eurostat 's ability to conduct audits when there were statistical problems that could not be resolved through standard notifications .
We did so with recommendations that could not be prepared until we had a programme in front of us , which the Greek Government drew up and sent to us on 15 January .
This is everyone 's responsibility : it is the responsibility of the Member States , the Commission , the Council and Parliament .
I would like to hear a clear demand to each and every one of the Member States , in this case starting with Greece , to meet their obligations , and to implement the measures that they have committed to as members of economic and monetary union and the recommendations given to them by the economic and monetary union authorities .
Madam President , as you know , the European Union welcomed the promise made by President Obama to close the Guantánamo detention centre .
We have therefore always been clear about our position in our contacts with the United States as well as recently , in the visit to Brussels by the United States ' special envoy on this issue , Daniel Fried , who was formerly responsible for relations between the United States and the European
