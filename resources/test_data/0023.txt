with their freedoms , the freedom of trade between the whole of Europe and Asia .
The euro obviously has its advantages and disadvantages as well : that is often the case for things that subsequently end up badly , but it also applies to things that end up well , as a result of ambitious projects .
I hope very much that the warmth of feeling and sensitivity shown by my colleagues who applauded your initiative and the sensitivity shown by Commissioner Monti , who made some promises , will truly allow Italy to feel that Europe is close at hand at these tragic times .
Finally it can be closed , by approving the balanced and efficient text of the common position established by the Council without further amendment .
Much inaccurate criticism was expressed on the agreement reached ; it should be confirmed that it is not true that techniques of genome line genetic engineering can be patented ; it is not true that blocking patents can be created , because the patent confers rights on the process which refer to a drug restricted only to the function shown .
The directive proposes to patent living organisms , their genes and parts of their body , including those of mankind .
This logic may lead to very dangerous consequences : for example it questions the Convention on Biodiversity , and the sole objective is the companies ' profits .
But Parliament considered that other ethical requirements had not been sufficiently taken into consideration and the first common position of the Council was rejected .
This is my opinion as a lawyer .
Or does it mean , as was stated in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights and as will perhaps be stated in this Chamber , that these changes are only lexical and do not change the substance ?
Synthetic drugs have burst onto the scene and we have to take note of the increasingly more difficult situation .
We believe that the spread of synthetic drugs should be taken into great consideration .
The increasingly more extensive and varied circulation of synthetic drugs has completely revolutionized the narcotics scene .
To answer these requests , the Greens consider it advisable to accept Mr Cabrol 's invitation to approve this common position without any amendment and without amending the reference article of the Treaty .
The objection will be raised that Italians , Spanish and Greeks in general want to continue supporting the European tobacco growers .
Mr President , this topic always raises fairly schematic and sometimes radical positions .
I think we need to act in this way .
I am therefore in favour of referring the matter to the Council of Ministers , as this might be the simplest solution , so that it can examine the proposal better , to provide it with the legal basis it does not have at the moment , or in some other way .
Measures therefore need to be taken , in compliance with the provisions of the World Health Organization .
Mr President , with regard to the directive on the reduction in the sulphur content for certain liquid fuels , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection does not seem to have followed the advice of the rapporteur , who recommended approving the legal basis proposed by the Commission , opting for Article 100a which , if accepted by Council , will make this legislative act dependent on the codecision procedure .
The many difficulties and delays in implementation , obvious problems of conflicting jurisdiction and the excessive red tape involved in the procedures have meant that criteria have been defined for just 12 product groups .
The scope of the regulation has also been extended to services .
Additional information on at least one and no more than three factors of environmental impact - such as low atmospheric pollution , energy efficiency and toxicity - may also be added .
It calls for an independent study , requested by the Commission , to ensure the environmental criteria laid down for the European label are at least as strict as the standards set by the best national system .
The free movement of goods justifies this proposal for a regulation , and the Internal Market Council has confirmed on several occasions , the last occasion being on 30 March , its political desire to find a satisfactory solution in line with the mandate conferred on it by the European Council .
It is right for each of the Member States to be responsible for its own internal affairs and it is perhaps important for states that have already adopted these types of regulations to be able to provide models for others .
However , I am unable to offer specific quantitative estimates .
Other Members - the rapporteur in particular - have already dwelt upon the issue of commitment to stable prices .
Mr President , when interviewing the candidates for the Executive Board of the European Central Bank last week , our primary goal was to assert a principle , that of the need for the confidence and , exceptionally , the right of censure of the Parliament with regard to the Central Bank : for its formation today , for its operations tomorrow .
This is the ground on which the dialogue between the Central Bank and the Parliament can give the best results .
I confirm , as already stated at the sitting of 1 April , my total agreement with the autonomy of the Central Bank , but in addition to providing for dialogue with the European Parliament and dialogue at the time of the appointment of the Board and at the time of the debate on monetary choices of particular strategic importance , it is essential that we advance to a situation of political cohesion that alone can guarantee that we will not risk being faced with a giant that is purely economic , but lacking any political dignity
