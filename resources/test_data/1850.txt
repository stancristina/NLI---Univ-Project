Enough is enough .
All this should prompt Europe to stress its wholehearted support for the basic principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , making respect for those principles a prerequisite determining the very nature of the bilateral relations Member States maintain with countries which flagrantly disregard them .
Under her wise guidance as rapporteur the European Parliament tried to democratise the procedures the Commission proposed , by making Parliament 's opinion compulsory through the assent procedure .
Transparency in public administration means rectitude in Community systems for distributing resources and fighting fraud , both public and private .
Madam President , it is a fact rather than a value judgement that once a man 's name becomes - or is made - synonymous with a political problem , it is then difficult to distinguish one thing from the other .
And finally , when the shadow of the gallows looms over the outcome of the trial , Turkey should be informed of Europe 's views , for the sake both of Turkey and of Europe itself .
All these talents should be passed on , so as to help promote a great nation which , until a few years ago , did not know the meaning of freedom , democracy and progress .
We cannot , however , refrain from voicing our disappointment that this House is only now being consulted on a proposal which was put forward by the Commission back in May 1996 .
The common fisheries policy must take account of the various players operating in the sector .
From this point of view , I believe that the Commission has proved very attentive and very open to suggestions from various quarters - Parliament , the Advisory Committee and also the sector itself - in an attempt to improve the situation .
The final point which I would draw to the House 's attention - and this is why I say that further consideration is required - is a problem concerning the Treaty .
For this reason , the Commission is grateful to the House , and in particular the rapporteur , for having taken this initiative .
Furthermore , according to the overwhelming majority of those attending the hearing , a grace period increases legal uncertainty by abandoning the principle of absolute novelty in favour of relative novelty .
Why ?
Because , believing that Parliament 's decision should be as broad-based as possible - a view shared by us all - Mr Schnellhardt sought to remove wine from the scope of the specific measures relating to it , overlooking the fact that , in the case of wine , labelling forms an integral part of its definition : table wine , quality wine and so on .
When we refer to safety at work , we automatically think of the structures already in place .
Of course , much still remains to be done , but we hope , or rather we believe - with our congratulations to the rapporteur - that we are working along the right lines .
Mr President , like many others , I am keen to take up the invitation to highlight all initiatives aimed at avoiding injustice against women .
The President cut the speaker off
Today , provocatively , I am wearing jeans and displaying them for all to see , not to attract attention but because the Italian Supreme Court and Court of Appeal have declared that a woman wearing jeans cannot be raped .
I am all in favour of looking after men ; indeed , I am convinced that only if we do so will they at last stop thinking that women can be bought , robbed and seized rather than being won over .
Let me give an example : in Italy , as elsewhere , women 's organisations have for years supported , protected and housed women who have suffered violence , helping to reintegrate them socially .
Men do not have problems linked to reproductive health , and have fewer ailments caused by nutrition and lifestyle .
Surely the need for this is obvious , especially in respect of information ?
Today is International Women 's Day , and not the Festival of Women , as its detractors call it .
It does not , however , mean that no problems exist .
The real problem , however - and I can say this because I come from a southern country , Italy - concerns the presence of women in decision-making positions .
Greater certainty concerning powers and competences will be achieved once the uniform electoral procedure and the single Members ' Statute enter into force .
Nevertheless , the Rules Committee appointed me to draw up a report - which has been incorporated into the report now under discussion , in Amendments Nos 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 8 - on ways of exploiting fully the existing scope under the Treaties to maximise the European Parliament 's competence to ensure that the composition of Parliament is and remains as desired by the electorate , and that the exercise of its mandate is not subject to undue impediment .
Madam President , the valuable work done by our three rapporteurs confirms , yet again , the need for the exercise of MEPs ' constitutional duties to be autonomously regulated .
The main incentives will be market exclusivity for ten years , awarded to the manufacturing company on certain conditions , assistance from the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products , exemption from paying all or part of the fees due , and the possibility of tax incentives - albeit at national level .
The EU is now hoping to follow suit , through Professor Cabrol 's report .
As was pointed out in our Environment Committee , this recommendation lays down limits for acute thermal effects only .
Next , the committee draws attention to the large existing body of
