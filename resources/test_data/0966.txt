It is a huge challenge we must respond to adequately .
Agreement on the outstanding financial issues does not rule out the need to think about the Community budget .
Mr President , we acknowledge - and thank - Prime Minister Ramussen for his endeavours to inject some ideology into the Brussels European Council , to make its scope wider than the dry , tedious debate on the funds we will need between now and 2006 , but , as we know , the discussions held and decisions taken at Brussels revolved around the financial winners and losers , and this , along with the matter of how to avoid penalising countries without losing face , was the focus of the work in Brussels rather than the question of how to establish solidarity within a robust , stable institutional framework .
As regards the Copenhagen Summit , the Union still has to prove itself .
It is interesting to see that the entire House - like the Council - is in agreement on enlargement .
We based our report on practical criteria .
It affirms equally explicitly that the fight against terrorism cannot be pursued at the expense of human rights .
Lastly , we must constantly and insistently make it clear that a political solution is the only way to resolve the Chechen question .
Given that the Treaty has to be ratified by all the Member States , a referendum means that the Netherlands are not ratifying it and are therefore holding up the whole process .
A few days ago , Mr Akhmed Zakayev , the deputy prime minister of the Chechen Government , was arrested in Copenhagen , where he is still being detained , and all attempts to make it possible for Ilias Akhmadov , the Chechen Minister for Foreign Affairs , to return to the European Union from the United States are being blocked .
The situation of these countries , particularly the ongoing situation in Palestine - a political and social situation in which there are opposing groups and feuds - is such as to suggest that such aid might be used for the activities of groups such as Hamas , for example , with the result that funds donated as humanitarian aid end up being aid to terrorism .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission 's proposal on the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy is worrying in a number of respects in terms of the preservation and future development of European farming .
We are concerned , in particular , at the proposal to make heavy cuts in direct payments , in that decoupling direct payments from production will not guarantee farmers protection from price fluctuations and will not boost their competitiveness on the international market .
This is not the kind of rural development we want .
Mr President , Minister , the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy is certainly innovative , but the debate on the CAP needs to be much more radical .
The word 'mountain' does not appear in the Commissioner 's mid-term review , even though , just a couple of weeks ago , he dedicated a two-day seminar to mountain issues .
Paragraph 17 calls for a range of measures differing according to the different types of farming regions .
We must have no hesitation in acknowledging their specific situation and , what is more , mention them by name in the new Treaty to give them an anchor and provide a legal basis on which to draw up an ad hoc directive .
Or is it a provocative act , an attempt to blackmail in order to get money in exchange for a behaviour - renouncing nuclear power - that it should adopt in any case ?
As we heard from Mrs de Palacio , our monetary contribution to KEDO is minimal in comparison with that of other partners .
This initiative seeks to promote political democracy , the rule of law and respect for human rights .
This group would work to safeguard and promote democracy , the rule of law and respect for human rights .
Nor is it an imitation of what is known as the coalition against terrorism , which , I am sad to say , includes some States which are not democratic .
It underscores them and emphasises the role of the European Union .
In this respect , in line with what was decided in the second report on economic and social cohesion , for which I was the rapporteur , I feel it is inadequate to take GDP as the only indicator .
What is the backdrop to the debate ?
The first point concerns the current programming period .
In addition to providing more funds for these regions , this would also introduce rules which are fairer than competition rules .
We in this House want to help you .
The self-employed are the providers of intellectual services , not entrepreneurs , and they cannot easily be made subject to competition .
This threat is unacceptable .
Not even the systematic interception of the contents of all communications by Echelon - a system which is now being enhanced by the rules being drafted on the gathering of data on insider dealing - succeeded in preventing the terrorist attacks of 11 September or the other tragic events which followed , since , in practice , it focuses wholly on industrial espionage .
Are we Europeans so powerful , then ?
They were introduced to stop anarchists and socialists from expanding their political activities during the period of fascism .
It may be that we Italians are particularly sensitive to this issue , but I would ask the House to show some understanding .
Mr President , as has been stated repeatedly in this debate , there is undoubtedly a link
