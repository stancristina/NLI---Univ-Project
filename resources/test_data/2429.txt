The Member States must furthermore retain the power in the future to decide the provider from which it is to acquire air navigation services .
That would give national authorities a choice when procuring services .
Eurocontrol 's foremost objective is specifically the improvement of traffic flow and safety .
That is discussed in the report that Mrs Maes drafted and it is important .
Mr President , Mrs de Palacio , ladies and gentlemen , here once again we have been hearing all kinds of reasons why we might not be able to switch to a single European solution with regard to the use of airspace .
It is hard to imagine a more sensible and more logical project than the rational and coordinated use of European airspace , especially as its use and the number of passengers are set to increase from here on .
The result of the current practice is delays .
That is better than using European air traffic services .
Who pays the bill in society when we act inefficiently ?
It is always the poor .
It is also vulnerable .
If a modus operandi based on international borders is the right one , we ought to establish centres in Andorra , San Marino and the Vatican .
The floods caused fatalities , injuries and distress .
In such circumstances the European Union also has an obligation to help .
The distribution of competence means the EU 's responsibility is greatest in the area of agriculture .
There is also every reason to use the TEN funds for the reconstruction work .
Our group is in favour of establishing a European emergency aid fund .
Compensation would mainly have to come from the Member State 's national share and insurance companies .
Our group is prepared to promote the fastest possible implementation of legislation and technical preparation concerning this fund .
It is important to promote the use of renewable energy sources .
Madam President , Mr Haarder , Commissioner Patten , the report drafted by my colleague , Jules Maaten , on the Commission Communication on relations between the European Union and Asian countries deserves recognition , which is shown by the fact that it was adopted by the Committee by a large majority .
I would like to draw attention to particular points that for many of us might seem no more than subtleties , but which are of particular importance with regard to our relations , for example , with the People 's Republic of China .
We have , however , accepted the concept of one China despite the fact that we are rightfully concerned about Taiwan 's position and we oppose certain measures or the threat of them .
For that reason , if we are to be consistent we cannot treat Taiwan as a fully independent state , a position most clearly demonstrated by the fact that the Chinese People 's Republic is a member of the United Nations , and Taiwan is not .
Therefore , the form of cooperation that I would also like to see develop must be of another kind .
Whilst we insist that China make further and faster progress in this area , we should also acknowledge that this has taken place in a country which is important to us in terms of cooperation .
I would remind everyone that in the last ten years around three hundred death sentences have been carried out in Taiwan , with just under a hundred in Japan .
For the time being , the vast majority of Asia 's Islamic population accept and comply with their governments ' moderate and , to a greater or lesser degree , democratic policies .
The most critical situation is that in Pakistan where democracy has been has been overthrown and terrorist activity continues more or less openly .
For that reason it is also very important for our relations with Asia to find a solution to the situation in the Middle East - and that includes both the Israel-Palestine conflict and the Iraqi threat - through cooperation across a wide front using the most universally accepted means possible .
I think this country deserves and , furthermore , needs the sort of first-rate care and assistance the EU has to offer .
We are still awaiting a Commission proposal on the third pillar .
Concerning both the first and second pillar , it must be said that the Council has shown a very positive attitude , and over several presidential terms I have found that there is genuine commitment and good will on its part .
Nevertheless , problems do remain and it would appear that this directive will also only take on its final shape in conciliation .
It is nevertheless clear that it is not Parliament 's aim to defend its amendments to the letter but rather ensure that there remain no grey areas in EU legislation , where public participation would be justified , but not possible .
The public will now have the invaluable right to participate in decision-making on the environment .
It would be in nobody 's interest - and least of all in the interests of the environment - if this tool were to be used for defending selfish interests , for politicking by opposition groups or to cause wilful mischief .
As rapporteur I have been conscious of the fact that the tool now being created may be abused .
Moreover , that alone is not enough .
But I myself have tried to avoid this by stressing the importance , insofar as it has been in your rapporteur 's power to do so , of arguing the case and the high quality of participation .
For all these reasons I wish to defend the rights of our citizens to participate in decision-making on the environment and I am , moreover , prepared
