havens outside that group of countries .
Furthermore , although there might be international consensus on the introduction of the scheme , the question would remain regarding how the tax revenue would be distributed .
For that reason , as Mr Karas also said , we should give more attention to the policies that lead to a certain currency being overvalued in relation to its actual potential value .
This again would require measures to regulate the exportation and importation of capital ; otherwise it would not be possible to focus on policies in this way .
It has to be remembered that money at present is first and foremost information , and that the global economy will , in the future , rotate more and more on the basis of information and intellectual capital .
Hence , as Mr Karas has stated to his credit , our Group is resolutely opposed to the introduction of the Tobin tax .
The tax would be targeted at the right place : at the speculators .
Those who oppose taxation on currency dealing are in favour of those tax-recycling centres , the tax have ns , of which there are 62 in all .
The Union should make a tax pact , which any countries could initially be party to .
It is strange to claim that if everyone is not included it would be impossible to bring into effect .
In the end tax would politicise the global , undemocratic system of financial power .
Madam President , this is an historic moment , as it is now , at last , quite clear to us all that the European Union has gradually developed into a community of values .
As Members of Parliament , we must pay particular attention to the fact that the work begun to establish fundamental rights is more important than ever .
It is more important than ever that respect for , and non-violation of , human values and the rights of minorities , including the rights of all those who live within the territory of the European Union , form an essential component in the rule of law principle of the EU , and , for this reason , the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made legally binding .
As important is the fact that Austria ' s forces of democracy should be given support , as none of us wishes to isolate the country .
Doubtless there are also a lot of protest voters on the scene that have wanted a change in Austrian policy for a long time .
Most of Parliament ' s amendments have been taken into account and the fact that the programme has seen its total funding rise to EUR 77 million must be seen as positive .
The Union has ambitious goals with regard to increasing the use of renewable energy .
The appropriations are needed for pilot projects , research , information exchange and also to cultivate more positive attitudes towards the use of renewable energy .
However , in the future , the Union will also have to increase its own input in promoting the use of renewable energy and ensuring that renewable energy is launched without obstacles on the market .
Renewable energy sources lower dependency on imported energy and their increased use boosts competitiveness .
May I also venture to raise the matter of peat ?
Peat is not mentioned in the list of renewable energy sources .
I hope that in the future it can be included in the list of renewables .
The Culture 2000 programme was finalised at the end of last year as a result of conciliation between Parliament and the Council .
It is really strange that legislation that adheres to the codecision procedure when it is being debated requires unanimity for it to be passed in the Council .
I believe and hope that , despite the assault on us all of the new technology , literature will maintain its status .
We need the depth of spirit that literature provides in the midst of a culture that has a short attention span and is inclined towards the superficial .
In this connection , I am very glad to say that soon after the Socrates and Culture 2000 programmes get under way officially at the meeting of the Council of Ministers in March in Lisbon , the country holding the presidency of the EU is to organise a conference to discuss the situation of public libraries .
Mr President , we are indeed now in a very rare situation : those who wish to uphold environmental values will take the side of the Council in their common position .
That is why , in my opinion , the manufacturer must take the greatest share of the responsibility .
Madam President , although I too have spent most of my life in fast cars , I agree with my colleague , Mr Florenz , that the directive on scrapping cars must make it clear that vintage cars are not included .
These splendid cars do not constitute waste .
Neither can we fix what the age for a vintage car should be as there are very great differences from one country ' s statutes to another ' s .
They are involved in low-profile work of valuable cultural importance .
However , criticism has been voiced within my group over the timing of the preparatory work of the committee .
Our group is keen to stress the importance of cross-border activity under the INTERREG programme and especially cooperation focusing on areas outside the European Union .
Such important areas include the Balkans and the Adriatic region , but , in my opinion , we should not ignore cooperation with Russia either .
This coordination is at present lacking , and the Commission has not as yet made any precise proposals to improve it .
