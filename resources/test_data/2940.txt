Thirdly , respect for the UN' s Convention on Human Rights .
Furthermore , the European Union has informed the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea that it expects concrete measures to be taken on these issues .
The European Union welcomes the decision by the Democratic People ' s Republic to resume its reporting under the UN Convention on Civil and Political Rights during the year 2000 and hopes that the country will now , on the basis of its own report , be able to enter into a useful and constructive dialogue with the UN Human Rights Committee On the issue of measures to be taken , the Council has called upon the Commission to begin dealing with the issue of technical measures of support which may be taken within those sectors to which priority has been given .
It is also a question of establishing areas in which joint measures might be taken , for example on the issue of technical aid and economic cooperation with the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea .
It is gratifying that an agreement has now been made within the European Union to make a better attempt to coordinate the issue of establishing diplomatic relations with the DPRK.
Twenty years ago , I myself had the opportunity to serve in Pyongyang and know what it means to be confronted directly with the reality of that country .
We should be prepared also to respond to this type of appeal when the time is right .
Mr President , I am prepared to support those amendments that have just been proposed concerning Amendment No 5 , because the proposal including these changes is significantly better than the original version .
I would therefore encourage MEPs to approve the oral amendments which Mr Liese tabled from the Group of the European People ' s Party .
Mr President , I certainly voted against Amendment No 9 about creating a European rapid reaction facility .
I think it is good for that to be repeated .
I have on a number of occasions had occasion to suggest this directly to Foreign Minister Lindh and Prime Minister Persson .
In spite of our having discussed this many times , misunderstandings may of course arise .
- ( SV ) We Swedish Social Democrats welcome many of the measures proposed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in order to improve the situation for young farmers .
We especially object to paragraph 10 in which the unreasonable proposal is made that the 'EU should consider making it mandatory for the Member States to provide minimum levels of installation aid to young farmers ' .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Members of the European Commission , I am very pleased that , at an early stage in the Swedish Presidency , the opportunity has already been provided to debate this important issue concerning the preparations for the forthcoming meeting with the UN Human Rights Commission .
What is , however , clear is that the issue may be expected to become one of the dominant issues during this year ' s session and that the EU will be one of the central players .
It is still unclear whether a resolution on China is to be adopted in this year ' s session .
Where women ' s rights are concerned , the Human Rights Commission will be deciding upon a number of resolutions to which the EU is strongly committed , even though they are not EU initiatives .
This ambition is reinforced by the desire to make a useful contribution to the preparations for the UN' s special session on children in September 2001 .
Work in opposition to the death penalty is a priority issue for the EU' s common foreign policy within the area of human rights , as may partly be seen from the EU' s guidelines adopted in 1998 .
An important prerequisite for the EU' s active involvement in issues affecting human rights is good access to relevant information .
What , however , is missing is a coherent and consistent strategy for the way in which the work on promoting this is to be carried out .
It is good that the Council supports the resolution on the death penalty and on the rights of the child and of women .
These must always be criticised , and when they occur in EU countries too .
I should also like to add Saudi Arabia , Colombia , Indonesia and Afghanistan .
We can make use of this position to fight actively for human rights .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should first of all like to say thank you for the strong support which I understand that this Assembly and its honourable Members have given to positive action by the European Union in the course of the Commission ' s forthcoming meeting in Geneva .
Lord Bethell is right .
We have not therefore in any way forgotten this important issue .
There are problems here , to which many of the Members referred in their speeches .
Right now , we are engaged in a dialogue with China .
I can therefore promise the honourable Members that the European Union is continuing to pay attention to the situation in China .
It is , of course , not only a question of concern about human rights .
I can promise Mr Johan Van Hecke that the European Union will take careful account of what has been said in this debate where Africa in particular is concerned .
For example , Sweden has for many years been responsible for a resolution in the UN' s General Assembly about the situation in Burma/Myanmar , and the European Union as a whole is actively engaged in the discussions in the International Labour Organisation ( ILO ) when it comes to the fact
