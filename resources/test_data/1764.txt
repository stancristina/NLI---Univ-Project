this interinstitutional agreement comes to be before us today for debate .
It is very important that all the EU institutions operate effectively and efficiently and the 370 million citizens of the European Union must support and have confidence in the Union 's internal legislative processes .
One of the key legislative organs is the European Commission , which has the power to initiate the enactment of directives and regulations .
The European Council represents the interests of the fifteen governments of the Union and has very strong legislative powers .
Parliament is a democratically elected legislative body which has the overriding power of supervision over other key institutions .
If the European Union is to operate more effectively then it is very important that the relationship between the Commission and Parliament is well defined and that is why the framework agreement between the Commission and Parliament is being put in place .
The negotiations for this framework agreement have been tortuous .
It may not be a perfect document but it is certainly a step forward .
It is more exacting than the agreement that has existed between the two institutions over the past five years .
I would now like to turn to some of the key provisions of the agreement .
The two institutions will now agree to extend constructive dialogue and political cooperation , to improve the flow of information and to consult and inform Parliament on administrative reform within the Commission .
There is also agreement , albeit not very extensive , on the EU legislative process , international agreements and the enlargement negotiations and procedures are put in place for the transmission of confidential Commission documents and information .
One could argue that much of this framework agreement only clarifies existing provisions under the present EU Treaties .
For example , I know that the Commission is required to keep Parliament informed of the enlargement negotiations to enable it to express its views in good time through appropriate parliamentary procedures .
That is right and proper , in view of the fact that the European Parliament has to approve the right of any Member State to accede to the Union as a new and full Member .
The Parliament also has the final say as to whether or not international agreements such as the WTO talks are approved .
Parliament cannot be expected to make important decisions on such matters unless the necessary and appropriate information has been forwarded to the Members for their consideration .
That is why the Commission must set in train open procedures to transmit up-to-date information on the whole range of regulations , directives and international accords being discussed and enacted by the Union .
Finally , I am satisfied there is always a need to clarify the procedures for the transmission of confidential information .
Madam President , on a point of order , I am very concerned indeed about the reports that have appeared in the press , both in France and elsewhere , in the last few days about the opening of an investigation in France by the public prosecutor 's office in relation to Echelon as well as , apparently , a parallel investigation into Echelon by the French secret service , the DST.
The European Parliament is an important body .
I am therefore very concerned that these two different inquiries , which may proceed as a result of any votes taken here today , will cause confusion , difficulty and may indeed prejudice the position of the European Parliament .
We shall certainly support the Conference of Presidents ' proposal , but in view of my earlier remarks we should now reconsider this position , or at least be given some assurances about the French authorities ' actions on this matter .
Madam President , my motion is that we hold a vote on this matter .
The committee which I have the honour to chair examined the STOA report .
We know quite clearly what the position of the different Members of the House is on this , and the Conference of Presidents has quite rightly presented proposals to us .
There is only one question which arises : whether we should look at one particular system which might be an invasion of privacy , or at all potential systems that might be an invasion of privacy .
There are clear amendments on our order paper today which deal with that point .
I move that we now hold a vote on this matter .
- We all applaud the coming of the second age of railways , and acknowledge that market liberalisation can continue with economic opportunity and public service needs to bring it about .
The UK invented railways , developed them and was the first to privatise them .
As a member of the Rail Maritime and Transport Union in Britain my view is guided by the balance we strike in railway development .
We should have acknowledged here that European railway systems are all different , and their diversity merits the derogations proposed .
We should have placed greater emphasis on the introduction of rail regulators , as the UK now has , and less on the ideology of physical separation of infrastructure and operating services .
And we need to be absolutely certain that we have licensing systems which carry obligations , and network benefits for passengers .
No one should have ignored these issues in the vote we cast today .
Swoboda report ( A5-0171/2000 )
The Railway Infrastructure Package agreed by the Transport Council last December was the result of some very difficult negotiations .
The common position represents a delicate balance which supports the principles of liberalisation of the industry while giving due consideration to the particularities of individual Member States .
Part of this common position includes a complex derogation in respect of Ireland , Northern Ireland and Greece as well as further considerations for Luxembourg
