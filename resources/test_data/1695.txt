I shall appeal once more for complete transparency .
Clear and focused legislation is needed , because we all know that the real inspections take place on the ground , locally and regionally .
They must , however , be exempted from unduly high costs .
As an example , mention might be made of the protectionist demand for 'an overall area-based compensatory payment for rice producers and ? a fixed import duty ' , together with the emphasis upon the system of import duties and export subsidies as a way of stabilising the internal market in relation to the price fluctuations on the world market .
We wish to see the progressive deregulation of agriculture , together with a reduction in the size of the agricultural subsidies , and we are therefore voting against this proposal .
We also believe that compensation should be linked to the area utilised .
No clear ground rules are provided , however , for the eight per cent of European farmers who are under 35 years of age and who are the future of agriculture .
The Commission 's proposal does , however , acknowledge the multifunctionality of agriculture and would make increased modulation possible , that is to say increased flexibility when it comes to supporting tasks other than actual food production , such as the conservation of biodiversity and the cultivated landscape , or to taking other types of environmental measure .
Overall , we have therefore chosen , despite many objections , to support the report in the final vote .
Your task , Mr Mugabe , was to give the people of Zimbabwe a new future and a new equality , including equality of rights .
Your task was , moreover , to become a part of Zimbabwe 's history , of its bright and positive history .
In a year 's time , you will no longer be the leader of Zimbabwe .
Is the EU to remain a closed-off Judaeo-Christian fortress with its claws out or to become a broad organisation of cooperation between all European peoples , nations , regions and linguistic and cultural groups ?
For the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance , the answer is clear : we hope that Turkey will continue on the path of reform so that formal negotiations concerning EU membership can be begun next year .
A reconciliation between Turks and Armenians must not fall through because of an historic argument of interpretation , but it is rather odd that contemporary Turkish politicians have such difficulty in acknowledging an historical fact without reservation - that , in desperation , the Fascist Young Turkish regime ordered the mass murder of Armenians , something for which the Young Turkish leaders were punished by Turkish courts after the war .
That is why I have voted against the report .
The principles of subsidiarity and proportionality are unambiguous in indicating that centralised legislation at European level far away from the sports associations , clubs and practitioners would not add any value to sport but , on the contrary , afford it significant disadvantages .
We who had hoped , however , that the EU would fully move on from the stage of being a technocratic union and become a genuine democracy based upon a common European debate have reason to be somewhat disappointed .
Anyone who wants to see what this Convention really entails must read between the lines in analysing the outcome .
That is the way the EU process operates .
This may get to increase , but it may never ever decrease .
More than two billion people in the world do not have access to electricity or fuels and are reduced to using firewood and animal droppings for their energy needs .
To find new ways of increasing energy services for the poor , at the same time as taking increased account of the environmental effects of energy use is one of our most important challenges .
Both the statement we are debating today and the EU 's energy initiatives in Johannesburg underline the crucial importance of energy in the fight against poverty .
No new financial resources are proposed .
No doubt , the majority of the investments on the energy side will have to come from private sources , but there is also a tremendous need for resources in terms of aid .
We therefore propose in this report that a special Sustainable Energy Fund be set up , rather as the Commission has now set up a fund , worth EUR 1 billion , for efforts in the area of water .
The Commission 's statement makes hardly any reference to the transport sector .
If they are to be more than empty words , significant resources must , however , be contributed in order to stimulate investments in new and environmentally friendly technology - investments that are often rather expensive initially but that are cheaper over the projects ' total life-cycle .
We must ensure that these sound proposals are more than just empty rhetoric .
Allow me merely to make a small point concerning the discussion of whether investments should be private or public .
Thank you for the debate .
I also wish to thank Mr Lisi for his sterling work .
That is not something in conflict with the objectives of the directive .
In my view , it does not , however , extend to include , for example , hazardous substances produced in mining .
Rules concerning the way in which fishing is conducted are the very rules through which we enact decisions concerning the conservation of biological resources .
Through provisions concerning mesh sizes , fishing periods and permitted gear , fishing can be regulated and the marine environment conserved .
What , for example , would it mean for seals and for the fishing industry ?
We are successful internationally when we cooperate
