area for the protection of the Union ' s financial interests to be submitted ?
At first , we approached each other cautiously , but watchfully , then we began to work constructively together .
We have faith in you .
We Members of the European People ' s Party and European Democrats want to use our large majority - naturally some would beg to differ - to achieve a fully integrated Europe .
Indeed that is why we must equip the European Court of Justice with the necessary tools .
That is an antiquated way of looking at things and we will oppose any ideas of that ilk in no uncertain terms ! ( Applause ) It is the task of the national parliaments to make a better job of supervising the activities of their own governments as Members of the Council of Ministers , and I believe the European Parliament and national parliaments should join forces to this end .
That is the funny side of it .
I wholeheartedly agree with you when you say that the European Union must have all the means and instruments at its disposal that it needs to pursue a truly common foreign and security policy worthy of the name , which also means strengthening our military capability and establishing the political and military structures we need for a common foreign and security policy .
He will have no chance at all to acclimatise because we are going to start straightaway with the statements from the Council and the Commission on the delegation of EU observers at the Zimbabwean elections , as per the agenda .
I can only lend wholehearted support to what the previous speakers and Mrs Maij-Weggen have had to say .
The fact that it was possible for observers to be present meant that in the end , despite the terror , the opposition was able to express its opinion freely on voting day .
We are now some years further down the line and there is still no sign of EURODAC.
Secondly , there were questions to do with demanding the return of funds : the Fl√©chard case to be precise .
I hope that it will very soon be possible to report back on the first positive projects under the new LIFE programme .
We have already inserted a revision clause in the interinstitutional agreement to this end , in conjunction with the Council and the Commission .
We are not so fickle as to behave any differently this year .
As rapporteur for this committee , I would just like to highlight three points that are of interest to the committee , within the context of the conciliation procedure .
We wanted more money for employment and we wanted to gather more experience of similar projects over three years so as to be able to subsequently arrive at a legal basis .
Therefore we must speak out against any attempt to make cuts in the budget that will harm agriculture .
The Council has proposed that the fund should take a cut of EUR 10 million and that the appropriations for CFSP should be increased by 10 million in return .
I should like to extend my warmest thanks to both him and Mr Virrankoski for the supplementary budget , which applies mainly to Parliament and the Council .
The figure under discussion at present is 3.2 billion , i .e . sixteen times that amount , and it will rightly be refunded , on that I have no doubt .
That would be a good sign and could shape the forthcoming budget debates .
The Commission will do its best to ensure that the Council does not take this to a second reading , thereby postponing the resolution until September .
Perhaps we need to reconsider if the negotiated network access model is the right approach , because it makes life easy for large consumers but difficult for medium-sized consumers and may be an instrument which hampers the European market as a whole .
Mr President , this report again demonstrates that liberalisation , the free market and competition are currently seen as the universal panacea to nearly every economic and other problem .
The prices of gas and electricity have sunk as the result of competition , Mrs Vachetta , including to consumers .
First I must thank the Commission , especially the Vice-President , Mrs Palacio , and the Finnish Presidency , without whom there would have been no common positions in the Council in December 1999 .
Only if the user pays , i .e . the railway undertakings also bear the cost of operating and maintaining the network , will it be possible to fund network operation and maintenance .
I think that our position , and my position , is that there is a middle way which will allow us to move forward , but it must be clearly defined ; we must be clear as to how we are going to bring about the liberalisation of the market , whereby the railways must , of course , be given a chance to adapt to the new conditions one step at a time .
There are two schools of thought here .
I should like to close by thanking all those who worked with me , both in my group and in other groups here in Parliament , for all the effort which they invested in this , and of course the Commission , and I hope that tomorrow two or three very good reports will come out of this .
That is what we want , that is what we need and that is what we shall vote for .
One proposed amendment therefore calls in particular for the Commission to promptly provide suitably worded texts reflecting the latest developments in the legal world .
