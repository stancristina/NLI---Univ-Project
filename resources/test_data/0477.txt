question : can you confirm here that in terms of quantities - I am not talking about figures or about values - just as much food was made available in 2002 as in the years before ?
Can you be more specific ?
Likewise Mr Garcia-Margallo y Marfil rightly says that the European leaders at the forthcoming spring summit must dispense with vague and self-satisfied declarations and must speak plainly .
I can support the compromise reached in principle , although it is a weaker proposal than I would like to have seen .
If I receive a satisfactory answer to my questions , I will be prepared to reconsider my amendment .
It is quite clear that not everything is regulated .
Finally , Mr President , the tax issue .
It shows that the Council and the Commission were in any event prepared to take Parliament seriously as a co-legislator .
That was also always on the agenda in the discussion and that should also therefore be developed further by way of the spring summit and those discussions about open coordination .
What , though , do I perceive within the European Union ?
I believe that there is .
If Parliament and the Commission were to accept ultimate responsibility , the EU could act with authority for the benefit of world peace and an international legal order .
The new weapons inspections under the direction of Hans Blix and the United Nations , and accompanied by military threats , have however been successful .
Withdrawing a quarter of a million servicemen from the Iraq region while Saddam is still in charge is a disgrace for the American president that he wants to prevent in whatever way he can .
Only the UN can ensure that Saddam obeys , and that the punishment does not need to be carried out .
The European socio-economic model must be retained , government monopolies remain possible , it is not a question of compulsory privatisation or liberalisation and all the commitments that the EU enters into are temporary , so that they do not have a permanent influence on internal political considerations .
Thank you very much Mr President .
I would of course like to associate myself with the President-in-Office of the Council 's remarks , Commissioner Patten 's , and also Mr Brok 's , about the tragic events that took place in Belgrade this morning and I support all the expressions of sympathy to Mr Djindjic 's family and of course to all Serbs who are undoubtedly very shocked by what has happened there this morning .
It was therefore a question of finding the right formula with regard to the independent nature of the operation .
I hope that a successful mission will also provide a stimulus to maintaining the necessary tempo in setting up the rapid reaction force and in the development and implementation of a more coordinated arms procurement policy .
In the whole debate about the possibility and desirability of a European foreign policy the mission in Macedonia is often dismissed as insignificant , a mission that means nothing and from which we must not draw undue conclusions .
We cannot go on this way .
The interest on the American side in the personal data of aircraft passengers cannot , however , be seen separately from their efforts to bring about a Global Computer Surveillance System .
For people who do not like this , a European Commission spokesman had good advice .
This is how it works in a partnership between well-meaning countries .
But as far as I have read these exceptions , I have to say that the transfer of data to the US is systematic and does not fall under the exception of Article 13 of that directive .
The European Commission , as I said , has overstepped the mark .
I am therefore especially pleased that in the resolution we shall be voting on tomorrow we shall also be opening up the route to the European Court , because it is not the first time that the Commission has tried to sidetrack Parliament .
I find it unacceptable that the Member States introduce equality legislation while the European Parliament fails to do the same .
I would like to conclude by saying that our Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities is going to have a major part to play in verifying the implementation of Mrs Gr√∂ner 's report .
Some false guides in fact try to sell what is actually specific policy under the guise of gender mainstreaming and that gets us nowhere .
As long as we cannot answer that question with a heartfelt yes , we must stay on the path we are following , despite all the pessimistic noises that I hear .
Having regard to the great surplus we must therefore reverse the roles .
Another misunderstanding that I would like to help to rid the world of is the alleged opposition being whipped up between realising the internal market and achieving a high level of consumer protection .
After all , not everything that the consumer keeps on his own home market constitutes a barrier to the internal market that needs to be eliminated .
We recognise the usefulness of the instrument of maximum harmonisation , but , like Mr Whitehead in his report of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , we ask for caution and that we proceed on a case-by-case basis , otherwise we run the risk of leaping far too far ahead .
Finally , Mr President , it only remains for me to thank colleagues for their very constructive cooperation and I can say to Mr Whitehead that I will answer his specific question in the two minutes I will be given soon .
I do not think there can be many problems with that , Mr Whitehead
