As I speak , our embassies throughout the world are sounding out possible supporters of our initiative .
It is the Council 's interpretation that decisions of that nature do require unanimity .
We must , however , acknowledge that after seven years of negotiations we are at an impasse .
With regard specifically to Brazil and , bearing in mind the growing strategic significance of that country on the international scene , the partnership established within the scope of the work of the Portuguese Presidency , constituted the beginning of a new relationship between the European Union and Brazil , similar to what we are seeing now with Russia , India and China .
We think , however , that in order to achieve this objective , it would be appropriate for the Commission to extend this derogation slightly , that is to extend the validity of the measure to two years rather than one ; and it is understandable that it should be prolonged because it is obvious that there is a lack of programming for agriculture and at the beginning of the next Autumn-Winter season we shall still not have a definitive decision on the outcome of the debate we shall be holding within the health check .
The bilateral political dialogue under way between Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas and the recent setting up of the negotiating teams on both sides are courageous and encouraging steps which we approve of and support and which we hope might enable tangible results to be brought to the international meeting in the autumn , a meeting instigated by the United States of America .
Moreover the Quartet 's representative , Tony Blair , warned of the urgent need to develop the Palestinian economy and the respective institutions , as prerequisites for the appropriate functioning of the future Palestinian State .
The European Union has consistently reaffirmed its full commitment to continuing humanitarian assistance to Gaza .
We do , however , think that the European Union should not bear that financial burden alone and that it would therefore be desirable for other partners , in particular the Arab States , to make a contribution to this effort and to bear some of the cost of building the Palestinian State .
We understand that continuous and sustained support for the economic development of the Palestinian territories is one of the bases for peace .
I would like to say that the European Union has a political strategy for the Middle East Peace process based on sound pillars and principles and that is why the European Union is a welcome partner in the political process .
We know that when there are problems of any kind it is always the women who suffer most throughout the world , Europe , America , Asia , Africa , everywhere .
Account must be taken of the context and of the discrimination which still continues against women and it is an absolute tragedy that many cases go unpunished .
His death is of course a great loss not only to the European Parliament but also to the Portuguese Socialist Party .
His passing is a personal loss to me , the loss of an old friend , with whom I shared many moments of my life , and I will miss him very much .
That was our mission .
Europe needed a quick agreement and that is what it got .
In this context , our strategy was to try to reach an agreement on the first day of the summit .
The solution that we adopted , a declaration plus a protocol guaranteeing that the decision on Ioannina can be amended only by consensus , seemed to us to be the solution that was most true to the spirit of the last agreement .
The Conference also approved a declaration clarifying the delimitation of competences between the Union and the Member States as provided for in the Treaties .
Thus we have a new Treaty .
In addition is the EU 's accession to the European Convention on Human Rights and the fact that a solution has been found to the issue of the legal framework of European citizenship , as requested , moreover , by the representatives of Parliament .
Stronger to take up its role in the world .
( Loud applause ) I would also like to thank the European Commission , especially the President of the Commission , to whom the Presidency is hugely indebted over these months for his valued assistance in bringing the negotiations to a successful conclusion .
The Presidency will not forget the spirit of cooperation , commitment and openness that everyone displayed in seeking the best solutions .
The President of the European Commission presented an important contribution to the discussion , based on the communication on ' The European Interest : succeeding in the age of globalisation ' .
This was also an important agreement .
I would like to thank you , from the bottom of my heart , for the support from all the benches that I have always had in this House .
This Treaty affirms European values , the good values that were always the foundation of the European integration project .
Europe has become stronger , better able to respond to global challenges , better able to respond to strategic challenges , and since Lisbon the world has been looking to Europe in the hope that it will once again take up its role in the world .
I too , as a European , am nostalgic for the future and I am nostalgic for the time when Europe discussed the future , showed leadership , and I am nostalgic for those days and I believe that this Treaty provides the conditions to enable Europe to do that .
Throughout the whole process of this Treaty there were two decisive moments .
Finally , Mr
