If certain amendments calling for stricter provisions are accepted , then we can kiss biotechnology in the area of plants goodbye and we can totally ban it right away , but that is not what we want to do .
Mr President , tomorrow ' s vote will be a litmus test of Parliament ' s responsibility and credibility .
If we in the EU hamper or even block the use of genetically modified organisms , we shall be manoeuvring ourselves into a backwater in this important area .
