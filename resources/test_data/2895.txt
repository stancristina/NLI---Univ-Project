While the Convention method is a valuable one , and productive in terms of drawing up a basic text that is seeking a broad compromise , all the same nothing can justify depriving the European Parliament , the physical representatives of the peoples of Europe , of the opportunity to amend and enrich the text .
Any references to the religious heritage of our nations , even though this is explicitly mentioned in the majority of the fundamental texts governing our States , including France , making reference to the Supreme Being , and even though such references were included in the initial text of the Charter , were eliminated following pressure from several sides but particularly , it appears , from the representatives at the highest level of some Member States , in the name of an obscurantism which mistakes the exclusion of any religious reference from the state sector for legitimate secularism .
Let me point out in passing that seven of the reports presented during this part-session have been in response to national initiatives , proving that where this system is implemented , it is proving to be very productive .
The Marinho report now seeks to extend the principle of the mutual recognition of national measures for the identification , tracing , freezing , seizing and confiscation of instrumentalities and the proceeds from crime , established by the Joint Action 98/699/JHA in 1998 , to decisions in the pre-court phase , especially those enabling the competent authorities to take rapid action to obtain evidence and seize easily transportable assets .
As money laundering assumes vast proportions throughout the world it is clear that Europol should have the powers to combat it , with a view to devising a European strategy for police and judicial cooperation .
Turkey ' s accession to the European Union is an issue that has become even more topical .
Given the political and military presence of Turkey in the northern part of the island of Cyprus , this could not fail to be the case .
The Turkish Government has announced a whole raft of reforms .
Commissioner Patten , whom I must welcome , expressed some interesting avenues for investigation in this respect in his communication on reinvigorating the Barcelona process .
In this respect , I believe that the 27 partners are resolved to adopt this text as soon as circumstances permit .
It is furthermore in our own interests to support our partners in their process of structural reforms , upgrading and opening up their economies to competition .
I feel that with an allocation of several billion euros for the Mediterranean region over the period 2000-2007 , we shall be in a position to fulfil the expectations of our partner countries in the South over the next few years , and that is crucial .
Where do matters stand in this respect ?
Even those behind the Barcelona process consider that it has broken down - that is the description which has been used - and it is a long way from having fulfilled its promises .
( The President cut the speaker off )
Everyone is aware of this .
This year began on a positive note with democratic change in Croatia , as a result of the parliamentary and presidential elections it held .
As a result of this , we will be able to reaffirm the fact that the way is open for a rapprochement between all of the countries in the region and the European Union , within the framework of the Stabilisation and Association Process .
Lastly , during the General Affairs Council on 18 September , the Presidency-in-Office adopted asymmetric commercial preferences for the benefit of those countries that are participating in the Stabilisation and Association Process .
The aim is to adopt a regulation as soon as possible but , in order to achieve this , the Council must have Parliament ' s opinion in due form .
The Council seeks to help foster a climate of confidence between the parties involved and ensure that this is achieved .
Otherwise , the exacerbation of current tensions and the possible return to arms would be dangerous for the region as a whole at a time when we are discussing - and we were even doing so earlier in this Chamber - the resumption of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership .
As regards discussions with Turkey , we have just held an important debate on this issue and you are well aware of the European Union ' s position with regard to this matter .
I repeat : none whatsoever .
This demonstrates therefore that one country is not being singled out for discrimination over another .
The Council did not receive a copy of this letter but the Presidency has , of course , replied to Mr Cem and all of the Member States were informed about the content of the reply given .
This is what this is about , and nothing else .
However , I doubt very much that this will hinder his imagination in this case .
The impression that the negotiations had collapsed , which affected all of us , led Commissioner Fischler to call for another meeting with Prime Minister Youssoufi , to take place on 16 October 2000 , where he met King Mohammed VI , Prime Minister Youssoufi and the new Minister for Fisheries , Mr Chbaatores .
In this context , the Council attaches the greatest priority to pushing this work forward in the following areas : the promotion of renewable energy sources , energy efficiency , the security of energy supplies and the diversification of energy sources .
These are indeed very interesting suggestions which merit a debate , but I cannot give you an answer on behalf of the Council right now .
By the end of 2004 at the latest , the European Council will take stock of the situation regarding any outstanding disputes ,
