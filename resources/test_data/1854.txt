Mr President , of course , the Catalan Members here today , such as yourself , Mr Gasòliba and I , are particularly affected by this tragedy .
My colleague and compatriot Carmen Cerdeira contributed ideas and amendments that are now part of the text on which we are going to vote .
I think that this will be an important task for the Commission .
I believe that this report covers three important aspects .
Secondly , Mr President , I feel that penalties are essential .
Mr President , is it not acceptable that , in the case of Doñana , public money should be being used to regenerate the area , while the company that caused the major damage has only contributed a small proportion ?
A part of reality is not sufficient by itself .
This cannot continue , Madam President , because some of us have enormous problems getting here , specifically those of us who come from outlying regions .
To this end , I would ask you to take the necessary steps so that the said submarine may be towed away and repaired somewhere where there are sufficient safeguards , and so that we can thereby prevent the social alarm which is being caused .
It is very odd that there are still colonies within the European Union in the year 2000 , but that is the case , Madam President .
Madam President , my group believes that the issue of biotechnology - because we are not only talking about cloning - is an issue which not only concerns various Member State governments , but is one which is also of considerable concern to public opinion .
On the one side , there are the 15 states of the Union and , on the other , Algeria , Cyprus , Egypt , Israel , Jordan , Lebanon , Malta , Morocco , Syria , Tunisia , Turkey and the Palestinian territories .
Meanwhile , measures are also being considered to facilitate private investment in these 12 countries , which in 1994 amounted to EUR 3 500 million , particularly by means of updating legislation and administration , as well as by means of meetings between companies belonging to the MEDA countries and the European Union .
The Commission principally defines three initiatives for achieving greater efficiency : on the one hand , making the decision-making process more dynamic , focussing the activity of the " MED Committee " on strategic planning and programming .
The deep schism that divides the Mediterranean world is obvious .
We agree absolutely with this .
To this end , Commissioner , we ask , and my group will act in accordance with this request in the budgetary debate , for the restoration in the regulation of the amounts allocated to MEDA , so that these will remain at least equal in real terms to those allocated during the previous period .
Therefore , Mediterranean policy must be a fundamental pillar of the Union ' s external action , which will benefit the European Union itself .
In this respect , I would like to refer to the wonderful article by Mr Riccardi of two or three months ago , in which he spoke specifically of the fact that , for reasons of scale , the Mediterranean countries do not attract investment .
The same thing is happening with many other industrial projects .
We propose basically to make decisive progress in three areas .
We therefore propose that the Commission delegations become Community delegations so that their relations with the Council may be closer , through the High Representative of the CFSP , as well as their relations with the European Parliament and its members , thereby guaranteeing greater efficiency and political control of their activities .
Therefore , the rapporteur cannot support those amendments which would represent profound structural changes to the institutional architecture of the Union .
Also , we sometimes fail to exploit the rich diplomatic experience we possess in Europe and often there are worrying confrontations between these various diplomatic services .
Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for producing this report .
Therefore , Mr President , it is clear that anything which helps to improve the preparation and knowledge of the Commission officials will be an important element for the European Union ' s external action .
We now hope , Commissioner , that the future programme that will replace it will add better management to these positive effects .
In short , we hope that this experience of the ECIP , which has been very important for Latin America , will serve to improve the programme replacing it , which , we have noted , has no clear role in the Commission ' s plan for reform .
In my opinion , this requires a strengthening of human resources in the Commission ' s offices in the countries involved .
The results obtained so far are encouraging .
In these times of Commission reform , when many Community policies and procedures are being questioned , humanitarian aid has been evaluated positively by different bodies and , of course , on a political level , by Parliament .
Humanitarian aid did arrive , but during this interregnum it has not continued for rehabilitation and development cooperation .
We believe that it is essential that , when a humanitarian catastrophe occurs , whether natural or caused by man , instruments are already in place .
You may be certain , Commissioner Patten , that this report is of the greatest importance to Parliament .
In certain cases , in Cuba for example - as you know , Commissioner - in the guise of humanitarian aid , programmes are implemented which are no such thing , but simply a form of concealed cooperation , sometimes for reasons of 'ideological solidarity ' with the Castro
