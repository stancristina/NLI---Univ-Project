to deal with these matters .
We want to encourage and , indeed , in some circumstances , require nation states to look at their present laws , to make sure that they are able to investigate these abuses and bring people who abuse children in this way before the appropriate courts .
We are faced with a difficult task , not only in regard to the definition which we have decided to offer , but also because so many countries have different attitudes as to what , for instance , is a child .
We have tried to reach a compromise in our deliberations .
I believe that we have managed to do so .
I wish to offer my thanks , as rapporteur , to all those who have been concerned , not only on my own committee - the Committee on Citizen 's Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs - but also on the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and on the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport as well .
We have had nothing but positive contributions .
In my own committee this report was adopted with 27 votes in favour and one abstention .
That I regard as very helpful and a good sign for the future .
Because of all the support for this initiative , both within the committees and from public reaction , I am very hopeful that once it has been considered by Parliament it will be taken up and put into effect and will assist in protecting that vulnerable section of society that needs protection in this fast-moving and growing area of new technology .
Mr President , firstly , I too should like to thank Mrs Frahm for her work and willingness to support a number of amendments , both from the committee and from myself .
This has all too often been a very rushed process which has not allowed those of us involved to collaborate as we would have wished to find the best solutions to certain problems .
I would particularly cite the example of the allocation of the funding which does not even meet the Commission 's intention to give particular consideration to the Cohesion Fund countries .
So the proposed review process becomes essential .
Asylum-seekers are not a burden but a responsibility .
The European Union Member States are the chosen destination of comparatively few , compared with the world 's poor countries such as those in Africa .
A proposed amendment from our committee requires that all measures under this fund should be based on an approach designed to prevent any outbreak of xenophobia , racism , discrimination or inequality .
That is particularly important , especially given recent criticism by the UNHCR of certain parties in my own Member State for their encouragement of such negative views or their failure to challenge them - criticism which is fully justified in my view .
A change to the funding proposed by our committee aims to give a minimum to each state , which could be used to promote public awareness .
My committee feels that the money , inadequate at the moment , should be used to improve the facilities and services offered , which is why we also want to see an overall strategy for the development of services , with a view to refugees and displaced persons being able to play a fully active role in society as equals .
Not to take such an approach would be short-sighted , as others have already pointed out .
The committee also proposed that there should be greater partnership at Member State level in determining and evaluating how the money should be used , including the involvement of refugee organisations themselves .
We also want it to be a duty for the committee assisting the Commission to consult with other organisations .
How we deal with the dispossessed is an issue for society as a whole , not just for governments .
Mr President , it is very regrettable that this common position , which has been put together with such care by the Council and which paid due respect to the Parliament 's views at first reading , is now in the process of unravelling .
I think we are going to lose a rather useful piece of legislation which would have put in place a necessary supervisory framework for one of the growth areas in financial services , namely the storage of cash on plastic cards and other forms of e-money .
The concerns which have been expressed by the European Central Bank , which have largely , but perhaps not fully , been taken on board , are coming out in a way which is likely to damage the potential for this business to develop .
The concerns , particularly about the waiver , are misguided precisely because it would be very limited : it would be limited to only EUR 150 on any particular card .
Every issuer would be supervised by national authorities and we know that the potential for money-supply growth caused by this sort of issuance would be extremely slight given the sort of schemes which are already operating in a number of Member States : for example , on university campuses a student may be able to use this piece of plastic to buy something in a bar , or in a canteen , or in the university bookshop .
The reality is that other Community central banks - notably the Swedish Riksbank , the Bank of England - do not have these concerns about money creation .
If we look at the reality of the ECB 's concerns over the last few years , we can see that there has not been a stable relationship between the money supply and the growth of nominal income .
