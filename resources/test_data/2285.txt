Secondly , a definitive VAT system , one which is simpler and more effective , must be introduced in an attempt to dispense with the complexity , fragmentation of the market and potential for fraud that are generated by the present transitional system ; such distortions , moreover , are hitting SMEs particularly hard .
Diagnosis is a basic task of doctors , and of doctors alone : an incorrect , over-hasty diagnosis of an illness that is curable by medical science - which , as is well known , has made tremendous advances in recent years - can often endanger the health and , sometimes , even the life of a patient .
But quite apart from employment , housing also represents comfort and a focal point for the principal nucleus of society - the family .
This problem will not be solved unless and until we find a proper solution to its financial aspects , without even mentioning the lack of planning .
The new 1995 Convention , to which 14 Member States of the European Union are contracting parties , therefore marks a step forward towards greater safety at sea , in that it strengthens the powers of the IMO to monitor the signatory states ' training and verification methods .
If the effect is a general raising of levels of competence among seafarers , that will undoubtedly be beneficial for the international shipping industry .
For example , even now there are still some Chinese boxes , as it were : companies registered in Community countries but which nevertheless do not meet all the requirements of reliability and trustworthiness when accidents occur .
Mr President , I wish to second Mr von Wogau 's request , since my own vote , which was against , has not been recorded .
That is why it is important for all the parliamentary committees to be involved in activating this right , and not just the Committee on Petitions .
There is a link between television and culture and the need was recognized , not for a European culture , but for the group of different cultures that exist today in Europe to be able to have a future and not be suffocated by the domination of transmission modes and fiction , are all imported from the United States of America or , in some cases , from the Far East .
We cannot accept that situation .
But it did accept the word 'comparable ' instead of the word 'harmonized ' with reference to scientific data , and all legal quibbling aside , that was what we actually wanted to obtain .
In the end Commissioner Flynn added to the Council 's immovable position , by explicitly stating he was quite sure there was no need for the extra funding Parliament had been fighting for .
Mr President , I too believe it is very positive that a common position has been reached on an important subject , which completes the group of health programmes .
A high proportion of the population of Europe is now forced to live with dangerous noise levels , and we cannot ignore that fact .
In general it can be said that much of the noise , though certainly not all , is linked to transport .
So we do find ourselves in a very embarrassing situation and we would really like a remedy to be found .
The single currency presupposes holding individual national public debt in common and also presupposes equilibrium of balances of payments between individual Member States .
Then the currency can work !
More than anything , if Europe means being afflicted with new burdens , heavy taxation or economic and financial alchemy , they do not want to be part of it . it is true that structural reforms are needed to achieve a single currency , but they must preserve solidarity with the weakest citizen .
Money was invented by man and man has become its slave .
Our thanks also go to the four rapporteurs who have done excellent work on their reports at a time - I repeat - when Europe , particularly where major responses in the economic field are expected , is expressing simultaneous hopes and fears which we have never had to deal with before .
These statements were confirmed directly to the President , the Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok , and to the Committee on Institutional Affairs of the European Parliament .
We are talking about reductions in taxation , contributions and bureaucracy : deregulation to let small and medium-sized companies operate more efficiently .
Finally , on VAT , we favour the approach taken , we are especially grateful to Commissioner Monti for the intensive work of the group that bears his name , and we should unite behind harmonization of the system .
Finally , it will lead to better functioning of the internal market , which will also be stimulated by a more transparent VAT system .
I shall restrict myself to these points and just reiterate my deep appreciation for the work of both colleagues , which I have had the pleasure of commenting on briefly here .
We know where the aid needs to be directed and how to implement it : the fight against varroasis , the problem of pollination , the problem of technological innovation in the sector .
We think of Paris , Rome , Amsterdam , hence big city tourism , a type of tourism which needs neither promotion nor attention , far less subsidy .
So here lies the logic of taking up virtual , merely oratorical , positions , so far expressed in the tourism actions launched five or six years ago and extended only last year , but always as an experiment , something which still has to happen .
