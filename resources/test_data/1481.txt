to function in the future .
A future European constitution must not be a product off the Brussels drawing board .
It is a hopeful sign that the French Presidency is favourably disposed to this .
( Procedure without report ) ( Parliament approved the Commission proposal ) Recommendation for second reading ( A5-0268/2000 ) by Mr Trakatellis , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 93/42/EEC as regards medical devices incorporating stable derivatives of human blood or human plasma [13561/1/1999 - C5-0331/2000 - 1995/0013 B(COD ) ] ( The President declared the common position approved )
We have now obtained a clear position from Parliament but , after yesterday ' s debate , it is unclear what the other institutions want .
We have worked a little too quickly .
I therefore support Mrs Eriksson ' s proposal on behalf of the Committee .
As a Europhile Social Democrat from a Eurosceptic country , I think it is necessary to show that the EU is making efforts which are important to citizens .
The most significant task still to be accomplished relates to the Balkans , of course .
That is particularly important , bearing in mind that there is money for efforts in all these areas .
For ourselves as Swedish Social Democrats , it is also important to point out that we must now emphasise Budget discipline in order gradually to create space for enlargement of the EU , which is perhaps the most important political task for our generation .
This means , however , that we are only at the beginning of the Budget process .
I believe that most people are prepared to accept this , on the understanding that the money is used in the right way .
Where the present proposal is concerned , I am not however certain that people think it will be .
The increase is inexplicably high in category 1 , that is to say the EU' s comprehensive agricultural policy about which the Council of Ministers has the last word .
Prioritising is important in all Budget work .
This proposal for a Regulation lays down sound bases for the protection of privacy .
Such data may only be handled for legitimate reasons and if the individuals concerned are informed about the data .
It is important to establish a system that works and to merit people ' s confidence .
Those of us who stand for European values in a Eurosceptic country are now being given further arguments in favour of the EU , namely more effective protection of privacy , which is important for the citizens of a modern society .
I therefore want to congratulate her , and I hope that the Chamber will support the report .
We welcome the wealth of initiative and invention which has characterised this work .
It is important to ensure that , important as data protection is , this must not mean limited access to documents within the EU' s institutions .
We must also be aware of the fact that the European ombudsman and the data protection supervisor will be on opposite sides of the fence .
We must not be surprised if they sometimes end up in public discussion with each other .
In this connection , I want to take the opportunity to ask the Commissioner when revision of the general directive on data protection is to begin .
We are aware of the famous case in which such supervision was applied .
We are also concerned with the freedom to develop food and the food sector and also with the conservation of Europe ' s cultural heritage .
It should not be forgotten that , viewed as a whole , the food sector is the biggest workplace in the European Union .
Together with the bureau responsible for food and veterinary issues , other scientific bodies and national authorities , the food authority must create a comprehensive system .
When food safety is threatened , both public health and the common market are placed in jeopardy .
Mr President , I too have the pleasure first of all of commending the Commission for its White Paper on food safety , which is a good proposal , and Mr Bowis too for having done an excellent job of improving and fine tuning this proposal .
We believe that its main task must be that of assessing food safety risks and that its core activity must be that of providing scientific advice .
We are concerned with issues such as GMOs , additives , labelling and so on .
I hope that the Commission will really provide for such a strategy .
Since recital J states that industry and food producers must be consulted , I believe that a balance is needed in this area .
We appreciate the rapporteur ' s words on the open coordination method which respects the Member States ' independence on socio-political issues and is founded upon voluntary harmonisation and coordination .
We have voted against Mrs Van Lancker ' s report on the social policy agenda .
The Commission will use its right of initiative and support the Member States in bringing necessary changes about .
Our basic attitude towards the European Union is a very positive one .
That is why we are actively pushing the issue of a constitution for the European Union in which the distribution of responsibilities is clear to everyone .
A form of European cooperation which leads to coordination and more prosperity is the right course of action .
We are voting in favour of the resolution , but we wish to comment on the following points : The Charter of Fundamental Rights ought to be in the nature of a political declaration made at the Nice Summit
