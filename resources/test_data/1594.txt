Finally , I should like to call on the Greek Government , the government of my country , to abandon its policy of stonewalling .
The relevant directive on pollution at sea , which introduces sanctions for infringements , comes within the framework of this anti-grass roots policy of reinforcing the competitiveness of companies and increasing the profitability of big business .
Pollution at sea and the destruction of the environment are questions of huge political importance .
Unfortunately , we had to suffer a major ecological disaster in order to understand that , although the overwhelming majority of those engaged in shipping act responsibly , there are a few whose irresponsibility can have a tremendous adverse impact on the marine environment .
In a big pond like the Mediterranean , with heavy shipping traffic which increases day by day , as a Greek from a country which is the biggest shipping power in the Union and a country in which tourism is a basic sector of the economy , a country with a huge coastline and hundreds of islands , I consider it our duty to lead the fight against pollution at sea and protection of the marine world .     – Mr President , if in the past Braudel , the important French historian , highlighted in his work the political and economic importance of the Mediterranean to Europe , international and regional developments over recent years are making the Mediterranean an area of strategic importance to the future of the European Union .
Syria , like Israel , should respect the decisions of the UN Security Council on Lebanon and withdraw its troops .
I wish to comment on two or three points .
I think that we need to look very carefully at our relations with Syria in the future .
Here too there are numerous proposals and numerous alternative solutions .
We had the results of the elections , which give a full map of what is happening in this country and , of course , we need to approach our relations with Iraq one step at a time , with the first important element of our assistance being in shaping the new constitution .
We believe that in both territorial and international waters what applies in the MARPOL convention should also apply in Community law and this concerns equal treatment for ships under the law and efficient management of pollution at global level , because shipping is a global activity and must be governed by international conventions .
In the case of Moldova , hypocrisy about the democratic process really does exceed all limits .
They protested through its embassy , accusing the government of Moldova , and this protest was of course also signed by the embassies of large European countries .
Finally , today is 23 February , the anniversary of the foundation of the Red Army and honour should be paid to the millions of Red Army soldiers and officers killed during the Second World War in order to crush fascism .     – Mr President , the liberalisation of the markets for the profitability of big business and within the framework of the WTO included , among other things , the abolition of textile import quotas in Europe .
WTO analysts estimate that , over coming years , China 's share will exceed 50 % internationally , while in the European Union approximately 325 000 jobs will be lost .
Let them join forces with the consistent class movement in order to change this policy .     – Mr President , the abolition as of 1 January 2005 of all duties and quotas and of textile import restrictions is a development of huge economic , social and political importance to the countries of the European Union and to my country , Greece .
Industries and handicrafts close daily in Greece , while others relocate to neighbouring Balkan countries .
While the United States , Turkey and Argentina recently decided to use safety measures and impose quotas on certain categories of Chinese products , at the moment we are still waiting for the European Commission to submit guidelines .
Once again you have set the wrong example with this provocative attitude of yours .
Does the Council believe that a specific step should be taken or will this too be referred to a committee and be eternally postponed , while we wait for the next major humanitarian disaster because we have no money ?     – Madam President , civil protection , which concerns the prevention of and dealing with natural or man-made disasters , is an objective of the European Union .
Of course , I am delighted that the mid-term review of this strategic plan coincides with the Luxembourg Presidency .
Is the Council in a position to assure us that policies for cohesion and the environment will not be demoted and that the resources will be secured to service these policies ?     – Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , thank you for your reply .
Nonetheless , I should like to ask you to place greater emphasis on the question of combating the maltreatment and sexual exploitation of children in these areas and I should like to have your assurance , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , that the action plan which the Council is processing at the moment and the overall humanitarian aid given to these countries will include a real commitment by the authorities in these countries , requiring them to take even more effective measures to combat such phenomena which , as you yourself said , are scandalous and are issues which we need to deal with effectively and in cooperation with these countries .
Thanks to them , and to the Dutch and Luxembourg Presidencies , we today have a
