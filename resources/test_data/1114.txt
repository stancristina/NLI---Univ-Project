the example to be followed by the famous European social model .
- ( EL ) Although there are certain positive aspects to Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel ' s report , it is driven by the perception that the purpose of research is to serve corporate interests and produce new knowledge - mainly of commercial value - on demand , within the framework of the liberalisation of the market and of competition .
Funding must be provided by public agencies within the framework of research activity programmes which will support both basic research and applications , the final purpose of which should be to improve the quality of life for all mankind and not swell the coffers of the monopolies .
This particularly complicated directive , which has multiple repercussions , involves national peculiarities and different views , and to which all the committees involved have made various contributions , has evolved into a report and a consensus has been found .
Twenty years on , it is now coming true .
I must stress that the amendments which have not been accepted have mainly been rejected for administrative or legal reasons or because we know from our experience and from our collaboration over the years that the Council is sure to reject them .
We also agree with the idea of conciliation procedures in Amendment No 42 , consultation with governmental organisations ( Amendments Nos 21 , 50 and 51 ) and with the amendments relating to previous acts of the European Parliament and the Council ( Amendments Nos 3 , 4 , 8 , 9 and 12 ) .
I should like to say a few words to clarify the article on balancing the burden of proof proposed in amendment 43 , even though the debate and the Council have made it clear that there will be problems in getting it accepted .
I think , therefore , that we can use this experience and be bold enough to take this approach .
I agree - and I welcome your persistence - that the directive should apply to all persons present on the territory of the Member States and not only to Community citizens .
I should also like to refer to an issue which appears to be of particular importance to the House ; I refer to the distinction between racial and ethnic origin on the one hand and religious conviction on the other .
But we do understand how difficult and how complicated the issue will become if we have an extensive ban on discrimination on the grounds of religion , for example in education .
I agree with some of the ideas for their role which you put forward , especially the need for them to be independent , but we cannot specify how they are to be organised or how they are to operate because that is a question for the Member States themselves .
As the rapporteur rightly pointed out , the directive may only intervene where there is Community jurisdiction .
The Commission prefers to follow a gradual approach due to the complexity of the issue and , when processing specific legislative measures on admission policies in these two areas , i .e . asylum and immigration , the Commission will evaluate the situation and decide to what extent the inclusion of an ad hoc clause against discrimination would be the most suitable response .
Ladies and gentlemen , I think that if we show the joint political will and continue our excellent collaboration , we can make the small vision of Europe ' s fundamental commitment on the issue of racism come true .
The need to combat discrimination on the grounds of racial or ethnic origin or religious conviction is taking on a sense of urgency on the continent of Europe .
Once the directive has been adopted by the Council , we hope that the Member States will quickly give immediate priority : first , to judicial cooperation and harmonisation of their criminal legislation ; secondly , to instructing state agencies and employers on how to apply the directive to all natural and legal persons ; thirdly , to applying the 1997 Charter of the European Political Parties on the defence of fundamental rights and the fight against all forms of racial violence ; fourthly , to the right of individual victims of discrimination to take collective action ; fifthly , to guaranteeing the access of minorities to vocational training , employment , health services and national insurance and pension schemes and their participation in economic , social , political and cultural life .
The Union and the Member States currently have no powers whatsoever to intervene efficiently and break up the gangs operating almost undisturbed in our midst and in our neighbourhoods .
Le Monde recently published shocking information on the activities of human traffickers , who are taking advantage of the situation in Kosovo and working with international illegal immigration organisations in order to sexually exploit some 300 000 women in France , Germany and Belgium , women mainly from Kosovo , but also from Moldavia , Romania and Bosnia .
We need initiatives on several fronts : legislative and administrative measures , harmonisation of legislation and prosecution methods , harsh punishment , protection for victims and collaboration between police and judicial authorities .
The Tampere conclusions noted that the Union needed a comprehensive approach to the phenomenon of immigration , which is clearly linked to a whole series of political questions which have remained unanswered .
It is linked to respect for human rights and to the economic , social , political and cultural conditions in the person ' s country of origin .
As far as the content of the Finnish initiative is concerned , there is no explanatory statement attached to the draft regulation .
The regulation aims to determine which Member State is obliged to readmit a third country national in order to implement the agreement in question
