However , it is a fragile agreement .
Mr Swoboda has never heard talk of Great Albania , I hear it every day living and working as I do in the area .
Otherwise we shall come back in a few years ' time to count up our mistakes .
Perhaps this dispute should never have arisen , perhaps it should have been settled a long time ago ; in any event , negotiations are under way , friendly negotiations , and I trust that this problem will soon be resolved .
It is providing political support by steadfastly backing the policy of reconciliation being applied by the government in our neighbouring country to the extremely difficult , the terribly difficult internal problems which it faces and it is providing international support in that it has officially called on NATO to prevent the anarchy which other areas in the region are endeavouring to import via our neighbouring country .
Unfortunately , it has proven effective and we must oppose it .
Mr President , the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece will not be voting in favour of this agreement with the FYROM , because it proves yet again that the European Union is endeavouring to get a tighter grip on this country .
Having set the wolf to guard the lambs , it is up to the High Representative to monitor compliance with the agreement .
That is why , in our view , this policy , as set out in the present report , merely adds fuel to the fire raging in the Balkans and offers encouragement to the grand unification plans of the Albanian nationalists .
Mr President , Commissioner , it is fifteen years since the epic disaster at Chernobyl but the consequences are still being measured today .
Where human error combines with a nuclear reactor which is unsafe and does not meet proper safety standards , as in the present case , then of course the dangers are immense .
For example , what has been said about Kozlodoui ?
Because there are financial considerations .
For example , I read in the papers two days ago that the official press in Kozlodoui said that it could stay in operation until 2010 .
I think that , if money needs to be spent , Commissioner , we should spend it .
Mr President , the stability and convergence programmes being evaluated today by Parliament constitute the second updates of the original programmes first presented in 1999 by the 14 Member States , with the exception of Greece , which submitted its first programme this year .
Greece ' s middle name was inflation - 13 % in 1993 - and deficit - over 14 % of GDP in 1993 .
Also , instead of 13 % , inflation is expected to be a mere 2.3 % .
It points out that inflation was slightly above the ceiling set by the European Central Bank as the result of outside influences ( oil prices , depreciation in the euro against the dollar ) , rather than internal economic weaknesses .
High oil prices , high interest rates and the slowdown in the American economy have caused initial forecasts to be revised downwards to between 2.4 % and 2.8 % .
They have used their surpluses to repay public debt , reduce taxes and increase public investment and , in the longer term , to stabilise the state pension system , which has also become an important consideration , with some resources being directed towards a reserve fund .
In the current situation , characterised by the menace of a serious recession in the US economy , as well as the persistent need to raise the rate of growth in Europe , debt repayment as well as tax reductions seem to us of lesser importance than financing public investment , naturally in balanced budgets , not deficits , both for supporting flagging growth and for pushing forward those structural changes necessary for the transition to a modern , technologically pioneering , full employment economy in Europe .
It should not be forgotten that the absorption of high rates of unemployment presupposes the consistent achievement of a 3 % rate of growth , a target which cannot be said to have been met on a permanent basis in our economy .
At a time of huge food scares , with dangerous consequences for the health of consumers , some of whom have even died , one would have expected greater sensitivity on the question of food safety .
Not , of course , that we are labouring under the misapprehension that controls which fully guarantee the safety of the food produced are possible in a capitalist system .
Katiforis report ( A5-0127/2001 )
It alleges that 'structural reform ' and liberalisation make a contribution to development ( obviously of big business , not the workers ) .
It considers the application of stability and convergence programmes to be extremely important and welcomes Greece ' s first stability programme , which demanded and , in fact , still demands continuous programmes of increasingly strict , unilateral , barbaric and inhumane austerity .
The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece are voting against this report which promises more poverty for the workers and new mega-profits for big business and which is intended to undermine everything the workers have achieved .
I tabled a priority question to the Commission on 15 February 2001 on the work of the national land register in Greece .
Parliament ' s services have sent out four reminders .
I only hope that his release marks the beginning of a change in the behaviour of his kidnappers and that they allow Turkish Cypriots to contact their Greek counterparts , because then the irregular situation in Cyprus would be resolved very quickly .
In a sense , therefore , this
