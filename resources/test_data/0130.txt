The need to reduce state expenditure and the need for action to resolve the demographic problem , for which the system and anti-grass roots policies are to blame , are being used as a cover-up in order to abolish basic rights , increase the retirement age , extend working life to lifelong work and convert pensions to welfare benefits , while the problem of unemployment is getting worse and part-time employment is increasing .

( EL ) The title " strengthening cooperation with third countries in the field of higher education " conceals a new endeavour to export the European Union 's education model to candidate countries , other countries on the European continent and third world countries , witness the report 's emphasis on developing "internationally competitive systems of higher education " .
The parliamentary report outdoes even the Commission text at this point .
That is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report .
World public opinion was shocked recently by the sentences of death by stoning passed on women accused of adultery while , under this extremely fair law , the men of course get off scot-free .
We need to send a very strong message on all these points to the federal government of Nigeria from this House today , calling on it to ensure that the country 's courts operate in accordance with international law on human rights and the Charter of Human Rights , which has even been included in Nigeria 's constitution .
They harbour ideas of national splendour .
They harbour xenophobic ideas .
I should like to close , Mr President , by saying that we have a duty to intervene at once in the Middle East in order to protect the Palestinians , in order to protect Israel from anti-Semitism and in order to protect the very future of democracy in Europe .
The position taken by Mr Solana confirms the reading of the Communist Party of Greece , especially after the Helsinki Summit , that the process for Cyprus to accede to the European Union will split the island , legitimise the Turkish occupation and justify the 1974 invasion .
Mr President , I too have a point of order to make concerning Mr Solana 's visit to Greece .
I should like to ask you to take note of our objection , Mr President , and to do whatever you can to put a stop to this unacceptable pressure .
The European Union is also responsible , as a result of its policy , for the starvation and misery in the rest of the world .
One thing you can be sure of is that Israel does not want peace .
Its objective is to wipe out an entire nation and implement the chauvinist expansionist plans of its most extreme elements ...
Mr President , there are two important reports on this evening 's agenda .
To be perfectly honest , it was the situation of women in Afghanistan , which unfortunately came to light after the terrorist attack on September 11 , which woke us up to the plight of women 's rights in various parts of the globe .
This is also immensely important to the new countries which will be joining us .
The conference on people with disabilities organised by the Spanish Presidency has already stressed the immense importance of infrastructures for people with disabilities , both to allow them to retain their dignity and to relieve women of some of their responsibilities .
A few days ago , someone asked me if I really believed that women 's rights are violated in Europe .
And it is to the Spanish Presidency 's credit , I say it again , that it has put these issues at the top of its agenda .
Furthermore , the standard which is the idea at the core of the guidelines for the European strategy on employment should also be the objective for women 's employment , as should stepping up measures to reconcile working and family life and individualising rights , as Mrs Fraisse quite rightly points out .
Employment strategies in numerous countries are inefficient , resulting in long-term unemployment and the social problems that go with it .
This is particularly important , which is why the European Parliament insisted on it .
Mr President , I subscribe wholeheartedly to your opinion that we need to be careful as to how we intervene when a case is sub judice , as in the plane-spotters affair .
Mr President , I understand that a bill to amend the Criminal Code has been tabled in the Slovakian Parliament , introducing imprisonment for anyone expressing sympathy with Communist ideas .
Given that Slovakia is a candidate country , I should like to call on you to intervene and put a stop to these developments .
This directive will improve the working of the single market and offer consumers greater protection .
The question of maximum or minimum harmonisation is still a bugbear and naturally voices have been raised in disagreement .
This principle has also been retained on the important issue of the right of withdrawal , with the exception of life insurance and old-age pensions .
One crucial point which needs to be highlighted is that the common position clarifies the fact that this directive needs to take account of Directive 2000/31 on electronic commerce , at least as far as the transactions regulated by it are concerned .
This common objective cannot just be confined to these initiatives .
The question was raised of including compensation if the employee is made redundant .
The big question which remains unanswered , and which concerns not just the present directive , is if and to what extent the protection offered to workers will cover all those engaged in new forms of work and if we intend to communitise the relevant
