It is only right that in Denmark we are seeing a debate on political union at the moment , as the Danes decide whether to join the euro or not .
That is the decision that they are making and that is the decision that is faced by the United Kingdom .
I trust that both of those countries will say no to political union and consequently no to economic union as well .
It is about time that the European Union stopped intervening and spending taxpayers ' money on one side of this type of political debate .
It is unacceptable , in my view , for taxpayers ' money - for public funds - to be spent promoting the euro in the 'out ' countries , because they are engaged in a very important political process .
To use government funding on one side of the debate would be an interference in this democratic process .
I trust that we will vote in accordance with that in the Karas report at noon today .
Mr President , the introduction of a single currency in Europe was never going to be a simple task , but with 11 countries within the Union covering a population of 300 million , I fully support the single currency .
There has been much debate in recent months about the strength or otherwise of the currency and I would like to pose a very simple question to the detractors of EMU.
If the single currency is not working , why are so many countries seeking to join the new structure ?
I welcome the decision to allow Greece full participation within the single currency .
In the Scandinavian countries support for the single currency is rising .
Of course we are waiting anxiously for the decision of the Danish people .
In the longer term , Eastern and Central European countries seeking to join the European Union will want to participate in the single European currency system . 1 January 2002 , which is not far away , is the key date for the circulation of euro notes and coins within the territories of all the EMU participating countries .
Business and retailers must gear up their preparation for this date to ensure that the changeover goes smoothly .
From an Irish perspective , I believe that our cash changeover plan is moving very well .
Fortunately we can draw on our experience of a change of currency in 1972 , when we broke with sterling .
We want to ensure that the mistakes that were made then are not made again .
Mr President , I welcome this opportunity to give a view from the outside , from Scotland , for the time being part of the UK, where our diet of information about the euro is dominated by a rather lukewarm and unconvincing approach on the part of the Labour government and an almost hysterically anti-euro rhetoric on the part of the Conservatives .
In contrast my party - the Scottish National Party - recently reaffirmed our position of support in principle for entry to the euro currency and we are not afraid to promote that view .
Scotland 's traders , from fish processors to farmers , from manufacturers to the tourism sector , are being forced to compete with one hand tied behind their backs .
Mr Karas acknowledges a high level of support for the euro but also some shortcomings in the provision of information within the euro zone and I support his ideas for addressing that problem .
But in particular I welcome the fact that this strategy also addresses those Member States not yet taking part in monetary union , since of course we will be affected whether we join in or remain out .
I call on the UK and Scottish governments to play a full part in that campaign .
Mr President , the question troubling me over Mr Karas ' report is whether we are actually asked to endorse an information campaign on the practical implications of the introduction of the euro , or a propaganda campaign in favour of it .
Surely no-one could challenge the need for information .
True , some British newspapers declare that we already know all the facts , but the recent announcement of the merger between the Frankfurt and London stock exchanges left many British newspaper editors spectacularly exposed on the simple issue of which currency would be used for the exchange denomination .
More than two-thirds of UK businesses are unaware of the practical implications of the introduction of the euro , even for those countries outside the euro zone .
If there is funding available for the many seminars and conferences which UK trade associations , lawyers and accountants are holding , then as a UK lawyer let me declare my interest in ensuring that we get our share of it .
But there is reason to believe that this campaign goes well beyond the provision of practical information .
After all , the European Central Bank is holding its own information campaign , so why should we be duplicating the effort ?
Perhaps we see the answer in the evangelical tone of Mr Karas ' report and his remarkable declaration that the euro information campaign must help to perpetuate the successful history of the euro .
I certainly wish the euro well .
Currency instability is bad for all of us , whether we are in or out of the euro zone .
But I personally fail to recognise this historic success over the last six months , and the astonishing suggestion that the euro has proved a stabilising factor in the face of international monetary crises .
Whether in or out of the euro zone it should be : information , 'yes ' , but propaganda , 'no ' .
President , it is appropriate to reflect for a moment on how
