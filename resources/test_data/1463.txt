This latest round of cuts and emergency measures will again drive hundreds more out of the industry .
The cod recovery measures in the Irish Sea last year cost the Irish Sea fleet a devastating drop in income of 42 % during the closed season .
Despite this appalling crisis , despite the fact that there are too many fishermen chasing too few fish around the North Sea and the Irish Sea , this House voted overwhelmingly at its last part-session in January to do away with 6 and 12-mile limits around our shores , to open equal access to the North Sea and to break into the Shetland and Irish boxes .
These decisions will be regarded by many fishermen in the UK and Ireland as the last straw .
Sixty-five per cent of the entire fishing resources of the EU are to be found in the waters surrounding the British Isles , that is the UK and Ireland .
Why should we sit back and allow our fish to be plundered and allow our fishermen to be impoverished ?
It was extremely foolish and short-sighted of this House to vote the way it did on the reports last month .
It may well prove to be the last straw that breaks the camel 's back and may drive the UK out of the common fisheries policy .
Madam President , the agreement reached at Nice will now pave the way for the enlargement of the Union .
This was the central objective that needed to be achieved during these treaty negotiations and I now believe that the way ahead is clear for candidate countries to join the Union in the near future .
The most immediate objective for the 15 existing Members of the European Union is to ensure that the Treaty of Nice is ratified across the Union as soon as possible .
The provisions of the Treaty of Nice cannot come into effect until the ratification process has been concluded within the 15 Member States of the Union .
I note with interest that the agenda for this debate which we are having today is headed "follow-up to Nice " .
I would caution all interested parties against discussing broader developments within the Union before the ratification process has been comprehensively concluded within the European Union .
This is really the central dichotomy that exists within the Union at this time .
Those who talk about broader political integration within the Union take for granted that the ratification of the Treaty of Nice is a done deal .
It is not a done deal .
It is a deal that has to be sold to the 370 million citizens of the Union in a manner that is easily understood and in a manner which commands the public support and good will of all our citizens .
This is a criticism I would level against those in particular who propose putting into effect complete federal structures within the European Union .
There is at times an attitude in some European quarters to the effect that ' we know best ; we will bring about the appropriate changes and the people will thank us for them later ' .
That is not how political persuasion operates .
We put forward proposals .
We then persuade the people of Europe to support them , whether within our respective parliament structures or by referendum .
It is up to us , who support enlargement of the Union and who recognise the absolute right of candidate countries to join the Union , to convince our voting citizens of the importance of the provisions of the Treaty of Nice and of its broader political implications .
What the European Union should not do is to carry out any further debate on new political developments within the Union before the Treaty of Nice has been ratified within any of our respective Member States .
Mr President , the Commission President has told us that the institutions must be responsible , transparent and efficient and he has promised to bring forward a White Paper on governance .
If we need to improve the quality of governance of the Union , we might make a start with the Commission 's work programme itself .
We should be focusing policy-making on areas where EU-wide action is indispensable .
We should be ensuring that the principle of subsidiarity is fully respected .
Is this really the case with the Commission 's recommendation on a common European format for curriculum vitaes : No 379 on their list of measures to implement this year ?
Each new legislative proposal should include a justification of why action at Union level is necessary and we might help , as my colleague Mr Clegg has suggested , by establishing a standing scrutiny committee in this House to ensure that measures proposed meet the criteria for subsidiarity and proportionality .
Your state of the Union speech , Mr Prodi , should be accompanied by a detailed list of proposals individually justified and explained , not hidden away in annexes to the document .
The proposal should be the outcome of serious debate in the College of Commissioners , not passed on the nod as A points .
Our committee should cross-examine individual Commissioners on the proposals in their area of responsibility .
Finally , the annual work programme should come to a vote here in Parliament .
Nice showed the failures of intergovernmental Europe .
It is up to us to make a more persuasive case for a federal Europe .
Mr President , there are , not unnaturally , different assessments in this Parliament regarding the Treaty of Nice , but even those who are highly critical of the Treaty - and there are many - will agree in this debate on the future of Europe that the best way forward is to use the post-Nice procedures and to make the most
