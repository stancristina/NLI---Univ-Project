in its commitment to this approach .
In short , we are currently slipping into a kind of world state , the foundation for which is merely a hazy catalogue of good intentions labelled ‘human rights’ .
Without the necessary resources , the EU cannot seek to strengthen social cohesion or to support competitiveness , employment , research and environmental policy , and it will also be unable to give due consideration to the ageing of the population – in other words to adhere to the Lisbon strategy – or to continue the fight against terrorism , drugs and crime .
As Mr Watson has just pointed out , and to pick up on the remarks made by Mr Poettering , it is the European Union’s duty to take the historic decision on whether or not to open negotiations with Turkey .
We have given encouragement to those inside Turkey and indeed to those outside Turkey who have campaigned and worked hard for a secular Turkish state , a Turkish state based on democracy and a Turkish state that respects human rights .
I would note that our position is not based on arguments relating to geographical , historical , religious or cultural aspects .
This is why I hope that the Council will agree to the idea of a privileged partnership put forward by France .     .
If on 17 December , against the will of the people , the European Council decides to open accession negotiations with the Turkish Government , the referendum on the European Constitution will be France’s last opportunity to avoid being swallowed up in a union that is European in name alone , and in which Turkey , the most populous country , will play a prominent part .     – I am against any further enlargement until the Union has achieved deeper political integration and created a powerful Europe and a social Europe .
We have to stop presenting the peoples of Europe with and instructing them to ratify decisions taken in their absence several years earlier by the Heads of State or Government .     – I supported opening accession negotiations with Turkey , and I did so for one reason above all : I want a better world for tomorrow , characterised by stability and security .
Furthermore , the return policy is strictly defined : the refusal to grant asylum has to be duly reasoned in writing in an ‘authenticated document ’ in the applicant’s own language , and it is not possible to use charter flights .
Steps to combat the drugs trade would threaten one of the most important sources of income for organised crime and terrorist organisations .
Yet I also wanted it to be a friendly report , because we all want Romania and Bulgaria to join and because this country has worked hard to prepare for accession .
The third and final area is everything to do with the .
Romania’s accession is beneficial to Hungary for two reasons ; on the one hand , good neighbourliness , and on the other , the issue of the minority Hungarian community , with more than half a million Hungarians living in Romania .
I mentioned them and our rapporteur has clearly indicated where they lie , and said that considerable improvements are essential .
The proposal to delay Romania’s accession that has been made by the very same people who were in favour of Turkey this morning is something with which I have difficulty , and I actually find it extremely arrogant .
On this subject , Commissioner , we have heard you say and we have read – and you also said in your hearing – that you wanted to maintain a dialogue that people can describe as they see fit , but which I in any case understood to be regular , relevant , open and prolonged , or , in short , structured .
I should like to conclude by saying that this debate would serve no purpose if we were not already thinking beyond 2007 .
Apart from those killed , 3.4 million have been displaced .
The message that you all wish to send out tomorrow by means of an overwhelming vote in Parliament is also intended for the citizens , because this Constitution is primarily a constitution for the citizens ; it is they who will derive the greatest benefit from it .
The first thing we need , in our view , is a set of guidelines and structures that enable us , at Union level , to control the financial markets , rather than be entirely at their mercy , as we are now .
Once again , however , I wish to make it clear that the ‘no’ that many of us are saying is open to alternative suggestions .
I should also , however , like to thank Valéry Giscard d'Estaing , without whom , I am sure , we would not be here today debating this historic stage in Europe’s development .
I never forget that he was a veteran of the young communists and I turn to my fellow socialists and say to them ‘never forget where you have come from’ .
In order to address this enormous expectation we need more effective , more transparent and more democratic institutions .
The European Constitution will put the finishing touches to this monstrous edifice , which was begun over 40 years ago .
It might , rather , be that marking the grave of the European project .
The Constitution , as such , does not increase the competences of the EU.
The drama of the tidal wave in South-East Asia illustrates once again the importance of such visibility and of the increased coordination of European action in the world .
What is important is to become aware of the fact that this Constitution is only a stage in European integration
