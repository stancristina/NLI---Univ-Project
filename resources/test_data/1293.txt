now has more than 18 million people unemployed , of whom 5 million are under the age of 25 and , as President Santer has just mentioned , nearly 50 % are long term unemployed .
So , rather than systematically advocating the reduction of working hours , I think it would be better for the competitiveness of European enterprises if we considered a flexible and judicious way of organizing working time , adapted to the economic and human realities of business and the business environment .
The General Secretary of the ETUC was not wrong when he said that the guidelines for employment which will be decided at Luxembourg will have to include the explicit prospect of reorganization and reduction of working hours amongst the essential priorities in the fight against unemployment .
I am thinking of Brite and Euram but also of information technology through Acts , and here it is vital that European SMEs have greater access to the Internet .
Proposals being formulated on the eve of the Luxembourg Summit are going in the right direction .
A stimulating fiscal policy , with charges reduced and abolished for the creation of jobs , needs to be implemented .
It is a radical change of perspective .
It would finally allow the local and regional economy to be respected for its specificity , alongside the global economy .
Jobs must be created in Europe , they must be created in dynamic industrial sectors and they must give rise to both public and private investments .
We can clearly see that we must change course .
Finally , this summit must not be one of rapid social deregulation .
Bonn Convention ( C4-0470/97 ) My group has unanimously voted for the proposal for a Council decision on the amendments to the Bonn Convention on the conservation of migratory species of wild animals .
It would be good if all the Member States could exchange their experiences on employment so that each one could benefit from the successes of the others , while remaining responsible for their own policies .
Alongside all the laudable efforts to make the coming jobs summit in Luxembourg a success and not another literary effort to be added to all those since Essen , the Commission and above all Commissioner Monti are applying themselves to the destruction of at least another quarter of a million jobs , because they refuse to take an initiative that could stop the legislation which will end in the automatical removal , by 1999 , of duty-free shops from airports and ships for travellers within the Community .
Concrete and even restricted measures ?
This is a time when the European Union must show proof of its initiative in the area of employment and where everyone well knows that the future is not in the creation of small jobs in an already overcrowded civil service but , on the contrary , in the selective support of SMEs .
Europe , which is heading blithely towards an overspend of ECU 5 million on its programmes overall , spends , relatively speaking , markedly more than the Marshall Plan did previously , of which many Europeans remain nostalgic .
Small coastal fishing is a permanent activity of crucial importance for the survival of numerous maritime regions .
Mr President , like last year , the Committee on Budgets is refusing to subscribe to the desire for rigour expressed by the Council which adopted a 1998 budget with zero growth in terms of real ECUs .
This budgetary laxity led governments to propose , for 1998 , a budget which , in payment appropriations , surpasses the real expenditure of 1996 by 8 % .
( The President cut off the speaker )
I believe that , if we are going to be absolutely rigorous , no calculation is fair .
Therefore , I believe that a delay of four years is an absolute maximum .
I hope that in a few months , when the euro is on track , the Council and the Commission will really take enlargement on board at last .
For this , we require the political will that I wish and hope for with all my might .
Mr President , we are now holding , as President Santer has just reminded us , a joint debate on the state of the Union and on the major directions of the programme of work of the Commission for 1998 .
We are beginning to ask when they will be transformed into legislative proposals .
I believe that Member States have not perceived the full extent of the advantages they might have gained by extending the powers of the Commission into sectors such as services and intellectual property .
There was therefore a possibility of amending your proposal .
However , in the second reading , it is proposed we adopt the draft by setting aside the question of the repairs clause , which has become secondary , as if by magic .
The Commission should take into account such comments , if it wishes to preserve market gardening throughout the regions .
Firstly , it establishes a true solidarity among countries in the Union , in that it requires a distribution of expenses and responsibilities .
Some claim it would be possible to set up a sort of European law , which would impose on the Member States an obligation to receive political refugees coming in massive numbers from non-European countries .
As the rapporteur has said , this proposal is in fact sharing responsibility within the Union .
If our Parliament is as divided as it is today , and if passions are running high on this topic , this is not because Christmas and New Year are approaching , but much more because we are dealing with an essential dossier , which reveals the risks of an unwholesome slide from best practice in the internal market .
