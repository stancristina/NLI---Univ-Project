key state institutions , including the presidency .
Mr President , the Commission has followed the case of Taslima Nasreen very closely since 1994 when she was obliged to leave her country to escape prosecution and death threats .
This programme will be implemented by different NGOs specialised in human rights issues .
The Commission has instructed its delegation accredited to Malaysia to follow closely developments in that country .
However , I must say that we were satisfied with the clarifications of the Iranian Foreign Minister in New York on 24 September last concerning the death threat ( fatwa ) on Salman Rushdie .
Third , the recent newspaper accounts of a US Supreme Court rejection of the case appear to be inaccurate .
The new condemnation of Mrs Zana by the Ankara State Security Court on 17 September is particularly worrying as it has inevitable consequences for the situation of freedom of expression in Turkey .
An important step forward was the decision of the Georgian Parliament last November to abolish the death penalty .
The Commission takes the view that Georgia has made important progress in strengthening its democratic institutions , especially its parliament , but that it must continue to reinforce the rule of law .
So it goes without saying that we ought to fight for that in all circumstances and especially when faced with clear-cut cases .
Therefore , we should welcome the fact that the concerned parties are finally sitting around the table to discuss the current situation .
But even if the provision of these two Directives appear to have been properly observed in this case , there is a general question of how best to deal with major crises within companies and how best to avoid closures .
But , if there is no agreement among them , the Commission will put forward a proposal for appropriate legislation in this area .
Finally , as to Mr Vandemeulebroucke 's request for data on potential support for Levi Strauss , I am sorry that is not possible .
The fact is that Japan , despite its domestic difficulties and in a climate of sharp recession , meets its international commitments and owes nothing to the United Nations ; the fact is that the political pornography novel between President Clinton and Congress has only recently escalated ; the fact is that , only four months ago , the stock market euphoria and the expectations of world economic growth remained high , just as the American economy was in excellent health .
But the pressure of the international community on the United States , headed by the European Union , must not flag .
Moreover , the Member States of the European Union pay what they owe in full , promptly and without conditions , and the European Union makes a point of insisting that the other members of the United Nations comply in the same way with their international obligations .
The European Union has repeatedly expressed its concern regarding this American legislation which provides for insufficient payment under unacceptable conditions .
A substantive change is the introduction of a new system of providing staff to the project as a response to the findings of the Court of First Instance that certain aspects of the existing system are unlawful .
This agreement , signed in December 1991 , should be the centrepiece in the process of deepening and broadening our relations with San Marino .
Since I am the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on External Economic Relations , it will be clear why I particularly emphasise the need to ensure the same quality in gathering statistical information in third countries , including some countries that are closest to us .
Indeed , experience shows that when you ask too much , you receive less than you have asked for and bad quality at that .
In addition to the Committee on Economic Affairs , a further 12 committees participated in the drafting of your opinion on the draft Community Statistical Programme submitted by the Commission .
Many important political decisions require a very stringent level of comparability and , therefore , a high level of harmonisation of Community statistics .
Thus , a sort of network was created between the statistical systems of the Member States .
It should be pointed out in this connection that the scientific independence of statistics experts is one of the fundamental principles embodied in Council Regulation No 322/97 regarding Community statistics .
Lastly , the Commission does not support the first part of Amendment No 9 since EUROSTAT does not have the power to draw up forecasts .
Mr President , we are going to try to make this a little clearer .
Half of this body is made up of representatives of users of statistics outside the European institutions .
The Commission cannot solve this problem alone : it is a cultural problem and consumers need to be involved as well .
I defend European quality as the true quality of the things I like to eat , and that is what I call quality .
If this is not the case , or if the industries or companies are not competitive in the medium or long term , it is in the interests of all , and of course in the interests of the workers , to find valid alternatives in a competitive world where a return to closed borders is neither likely nor desirable .
We must keep making progress towards fundamental solutions which will benefit all of us .
Since firms have until 31 December 1999 to appoint one or more safety advisers , it made sense for the standards and content of the vocational training courses and exams for the safety advisers to be harmonised .
Mr President , it is obvious that Commission directives are often based on studies that do not reflect the agricultural situation as a whole or the environment Europe-wide
