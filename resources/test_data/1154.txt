Special thanks should also go to the Commissioner , Mrs Cresson , because the European Parliament and the Commission are working together for young people .
The issue of the financial allocation is of great interest to us , because it is not possible to develop coordination without it .
Moreover , the role of the European Parliament should be increased with regard to information , giving it a right of appeal throughout the programme 's implementation period , particularly during the assessment process .
This was mentioned a short while ago : ECU 35 million for the two-year period is verging on the ridiculous , particularly since it concerns a series of programmes that , according to all Members - and many other people -, needs to provide young people with importance , belief in themselves and belief in cultural programmes .
This is becoming a more obvious example of how much attention is actually lacking .
There is no need to digress too much ; it is a brief but clear document and deals with a political and institutional problem that is highly sensitive for the European Parliament .
The proposed regulation sets out the means for adopting a decision where such an eventuality is confirmed .
I believe that this then totally protects the Council 's prerogative to decide and enables Parliament to intervene in a matter in which the judgment of possible measures to be made is an overall political judgment , relating to the consideration of many aspects of the matter in one country or another in one of the most complex and difficult contexts in the world , as I mentioned at the beginning .
Parliament is demanding the Commission 's full cooperation , however .
I am therefore expressing my full support for Mr Colajanni 's amendment , which confirms the role of the European Parliament as initiator of a penalization procedure , but also as a decisive factor in the procedure itself .
Even police cooperation , with which we still have many problems , is more advanced than judicial cooperation .
We are therefore making positive but also critical assessments which we are renewing with force because the democratic and control aspects are absolutely essential in such delicate and sensitive matters .
The figures indicate answers to letters rogatory in the various countries , even over a long period , of around 15 % : a judge or a bench of magistrates ask for 100 % and 15 % reply .
Secondly , there is the crucial question of fraud which we need to start experimenting on with the advanced forms of unification .
This means that , on resuming the debate , some of us will not be able to speak after the vote , which means that the Commissioner will speak without hearing the position of the various political groups .
The figures on the demographic decline and ageing of the European population have been known for years .
The donation of this amount should therefore be strictly subject to compliance with the many conditions listed in paragraph 3 of the draft joint resolution .
The work carried out by the Commission in Cambodia has been positive , as has been the support plan for the elections .
On the one hand , the government has essentially become a one-party government and , on the other , many private forces , formed on an ethnic basis , are dividing the territory and fighting interminably between themselves : a situation elegantly described in French political terminology as "un chaos born√© ' , limited chaos .
Firstly , we need to resume political negotiations for national reconciliation , which were suddenly interrupted by General Koroma 's coup , and we need to do this on the basis of the Conakry and Abidjan Agreements , because the military tension of today certainly cannot form the basis for a political reconstruction of the country .
Finally , I wish to express my great concern over the role played by Nigeria in Sierra Leone for , although it has partly contributed towards Kabbah 's return , it risks taking the form of a search for military political control in the region that brings out the antidemocratic dictatorial nature of General Abacha 's regime .
Nevertheless , I want to give my full support to the action being taken by the Commission and the Commissioner at this stage , because they are actually trying to remedy an unacceptable situation .
I have to stress several points made in the report , particularly the fact that it confirms that the enhancement of women 's rights and their adequate participation in all decision-making and political processes form an essential premise for making progress in the field of development , which implies , among other things , literacy measures and access to training and basic health services .
In the central regions of Africa , the difficult environmental conditions caused by the rain have given rise to an increase in diseases , such as malaria and cholera , with the deaths of 4 000 people .
Madam President , first of all we welcome the initiative , taken last February , with which the Council decided to change the existing procedure for the repayment of the debt contracted by the ACP countries : according to the National Alliance , this decision has certainly been made at an appropriate time because it enables most of these countries , in serious difficulties , not only on account of having to repay the debt but also the interest payable , to breathe a sigh of relief and face the most urgent reforms without delay and with greater calm .
Madam President , I would like to propose an oral amendment that takes the debate and the observations made into account .
First of all , I would like to make two points .
This applies not only to the contracting parties , but also to third
