While we make ourselves available to resolve a very serious problem which certainly merits much greater attention , I do not think we should be asked to do a U-turn .
With the defeat of the secessionist forces in 1994 , the country experienced an acceleration of the democratic process which has resulted in the organization of general free and democratic elections .
This is further evidence of the existence of a deliberate democratic choice which I believe we should be supporting : a global good neighbours treaty has been signed with Oman to put an end to long-standing territorial disputes in the east of Yemen ; the International Court of Justice in the Hague has become directly involved in the dispute with Eritrea over the Hanish islands , using peaceful diplomacy to put an end to a situation which must not be allowed to wreck relations between two important countries needlessly ; contact is even being reestablished with Saudi Arabia to resolve territorial disputes in northern Yemen .
Finally , I believe that the approval of the agreement between the European Union and Yemen must be seen as an opportunity to bring about closer Euro-Arab political and economic relations in a region which is of fundamental importance to world security .
For some time , Parliament had concentrated on that sector with growing concern , giving repeated alarm signals .
The report I am submitting for your attention does not try to solve the problems at their roots but constitutes an initial specific effort to avoid a future repetition of similar episodes and , above all , to prevent disorder and fraud from remaining hidden from the Court of Auditors , Parliament and the judicial authorities for a long time .
We therefore believe that we need a committee of inquiry , not so much to establish the state of corruption in the limited tourism sector , but because we are concerned that a similar situation can also be found in the far larger 20 % of financing handled by the Commission directly sheltered from any real institutionalized control .
Otherwise , we will perpetuate an extraordinary situation in which some people go before Parliament to provide information and then the Commissioners state the contrary .
With regard to the European Central Bank , I have nothing to say , as Article 255 does not refer to this institution .
With regard to the first question , it seems to me that , as the Member said himself , it relates to the European Parliament 's internal documents and it is therefore not up to the Commission to give an opinion in this connection .
This is not possible .
There may actually be an apparent contradiction between single tariff and price correlated with costs , but it is only an apparent contradiction .
For this purpose , it establishes that the preparatory work should begin in good time to be completed before that date .
Mr President , I should start by saying that the Commissioners ' speech gives me the feeling that , unfortunately , there is still very little room for dialogue on these directives between the Commission and Council , on the one hand , and Parliament , on the other , and therefore , unfortunately , we cannot find the openings we were expecting .
In any case , we should start with Council 's decision to fix compulsory values by 2000 and indicative values by 2005 .
According to the Lange report , the motor industry is therefore required , in a realistic and technically feasible space of time , to adapt to the specific limits laid down by the directive while , with the Hautala report , we can go further than the common position , maintaining the modifications introduced by the Committee on the Environment , aimed mainly at establishing stricter limits for petrol and diesel .
I believe that Saddam Hussein 's violation of such a resolution would seriously jeopardize the balances of civilian life and would bring further harm to a nation that is already suffering restrictions and facing uncertainties : this is another aspect we need to consider .
Thirdly , the UN should have an ever more significant and important duty , particularly at diplomatic level , to ensure that its prerogative remains intact and that its resolutions are accepted without any hesitation or delay by all those who have signed the accession .
But it is for this precise reason that it is absolutely necessary , as already confirmed by several parties , that the European Union and the individual Member States should make up for the guilty and self-interested inertia of some authoritative members of the international Community with all their authority .
The joint resolution of several political groups calls us to this responsibility today ; it calls us to define a common position , to support all diplomatic means , particularly the missions of the UN and its Secretary General , and its proposal of oil in return for food directed at the population .
This is a point that should be assessed .
Each of us will then do our parts .
However , the usefulness and effectiveness of the methods used to achieve the result , the balance of foreseeable human costs and the simulation of subsequent political scenarios can never be considered indisputable and inevitable .
On this side of the House , we nurture no sympathy for the Baghdad dictator .
We cannot even hold a nation hostage in the hope that this nation will cause the dictator to fall , because this is not the right way of seeing things .
Normally , when I go into Chamber , I switch it off , but this morning , unfortunately , I had not done so .
As I said this morning , politics , particularly
