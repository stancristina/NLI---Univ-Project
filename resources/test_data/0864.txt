between the European Union and developing countries on shared issues of world concern .
We must achieve a transparent system which preserves the balance between efficiency and the investigation procedure , in the event of cross-border crime , and respect for fundamental rights , with coherence and cooperation between the existing structures : OLAF , Eurojust , Europol .
The Green Paper , however , can be summed up in the idea , the intellectual hypothesis , that the defence of Community , and therefore cross-border , financial interests can perhaps be better defended by a figure also at Community level in this same field .
Mr President , I had requested the floor to condemn these intolerable actions and to express my solidarity with my fellow Members from the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , and I wanted to make the proposal that you yourself have made .
These agreements should have been much more ambitious in terms of their proposed scope and the fields covered , in view of the accumulated delays in the implementation of the measures agreed in Lisbon .
Our group believes that this debate should begin as soon as possible .
Since , furthermore , they are subject to entirely summary trials , I believe it is urgent that you intervene so that the situation and conditions being experienced by the accused may improve .
I think it is shameful that this Parliament has not even condemned this : this disgusting obscenity of the booty being distributed over the dead bodies not just of Iraqis but also of young British and American soldiers who are also losing their lives .
I would also like to insist , however , that one issue does not cancel out the other .
Amendments No 3 and 4 must be rejected for two reasons : firstly , because they are not viable in practice .
Amendment No 9 lays down control by the competent authorities of the setting of tests .
I would like to say to the rapporteur that he is absolutely right , that the effectiveness of all these measures will be assessed according to the Member States ' capacity for control in their various areas of responsibility .
This type of regulation seeks greater safety - and this is my response to the second question raised .
Ladies and gentlemen , I believe that the Erasmus report represents a further step forward because , at the moment , although there is free movement of workers , we do not have free movement of students in the European Union .
Therefore , Erasmus mundus is a great step forward , it takes account of different cultures .
I would also like to congratulate Mrs De Sarnez on her common sense and her open spirit , because that is the best way for us to work together .
In this regard , I would go as far as to suggest that we should give more support to the establishment of European universities and institutions of a European nature , which , together with the States , would serve as experts , as 'stake holder ' bodies and as genuine beneficiaries of the programme .
I remember the time 20 or 30 years ago when we were asked at school to outline what we thought the twenty-first century would be like , and we all imagined Martians , UFOs and flying saucers and ultra-modern trains and cars , including electric cars , yet no one was able to guess what would be the real revolution of this century : the advances in information and communications technology .
What is more , it will help us promote intercultural dialogue and language learning and will also facilitate exchanges between children who have got to know each other through the new technologies and who would like to meet face to face .
We believe that the same internal reform criteria should be applied in the Council as in the Commission in relation to staff policy , that is to say that the qualifications of personnel and their remaining in high-level , and therefore high-responsibility , positions within the Council , should obey the same criteria as the Commission , in terms of not remaining for long periods and professional classifications .
We would like to know the exact situation and the requests of this institution , so that we can contribute to resolving the difficulties .
We also welcome the improvements relating to information on the work carried out by the Court of Auditors .
With regard to the European Ombudsman , I would like to say that he has cooperated magnificently with this Parliament 's Committee on Petitions and has done good work , despite the scant resources at his disposal .
We also believe it unacceptable that , although the European Social Fund has the established objective of 15 % of total costs for the promotion of the employment of women , only 6 % has been used for this purpose .
And I would therefore also like to congratulate the main rapporteur , Mr Casaca , as well as the other rapporteurs , Mr Blak , Mr SÃ¸rensen , Mr Staes and Mrs Langenhagen , who have done excellent work , each within the field corresponding to them .
Commissioner , I do not like this work to be influenced , I like to have my own criteria , to make my own studies , to analyse what is happening properly and I must therefore thank the Commission for having cooperated enormously in order to clarify all these issues , so that the opinion issued by Parliament is really its own .
I have been able to observe their efforts closely , as well as their coordination with all the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control
