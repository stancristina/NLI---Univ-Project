We believe that the response to the present crisis should not be less freedom of expression , but rather credible commitment by a democratic , pluralist Europe to dialogue between cultures and civilisations .
We want an order that defends freedom of expression as one of the supreme human rights , whilst also being aware of its limits , which are to be found in the freedom and dignity of others .
I recall a conversation with a very committed , credible senior cleric in Saudi Arabia , which was , all in all , a wonderful conversation .
Commissioner Barroso is right : people are entitled to publish caricatures poking fun at us politicians , at me , at Mr Poettering or anyone else .
Let us not exempt religion from the social debate , as religions , too , have the right to say what is right or wrong .
In the same spirit shown by today’s debate , the Council will continue to work on improving understanding between civilisations and between religious communities , but will also speak in plain terms when it comes to rejecting violence , and when it comes to condemning the use of violence or boycotts against Member States of the EU.
Despite repeated requests by the EU , Iran has failed to make any further commitment to resuming the stalled human-rights dialogue .
We recognise the fundamental right of all parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to use nuclear energy for peaceful , civil purposes ; but Iran has crossed so many red lines that confidence in the regime’s honourable intentions has faded .
In my speech I shall try to add some further questions from the point of view of my group .
This is a logic that also needs to be discussed , one that was triggered by a pre-emptive strike carried out in the same region in the past , which was utterly wrong and which we vehemently opposed .
The questions as to whether sanctions should be imposed , what sanctions are appropriate and whether world peace is at risk , are not for President Chirac to answer , the man who suddenly issued the threat of France using nuclear weapons ; nor are they for Chancellor Merkel to answer .
The unspeakable comments by the Iranian President on Israel and the human rights violations in the country must not be exploited for the purposes of a policy of war against Iran .     – Mr President , Mr Vice-President of the Commission , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , we must not let the fundamentalists and those abusing the opportunities that freedom in Europe presents destroy our capacity for dialogue .
We believe that the Russian proposal to build a Russian-Iranian uranium-enrichment facility on Russian soil would be a good alternative to enrichment in Iran : this solution has the full support of the EU.
That is a considerable period of time , and for a large part of it the division of Europe into East and West by the Iron Curtain seemed to be an unalterable fact .
It is to be hoped that everybody now realises that an EU of 25 plus cannot work ideally , or perhaps not even satisfactorily , with the structures of the EU of 12 .
The two legs that Europe needs in order to stand upright are a sound economy and a sound social symmetry .
The very real utopia of European peace and the utopia of a sustainable and ecologically responsible economic order need to be supplemented by a cultural utopia and an educational utopia with the elaboration of very specific goals and their implementation as a priority consideration .
It is for that reason that we have the right and the duty to strengthen the confidence that we will succeed in our endeavour of shaping both the ‘old ’ and the ‘new ’ Europe into the Europe of the future .
In particular , I would remind your House of the progress made as regards human rights and the reinforcement of the position of the Chairman of the State’s Council of Ministers , which does give cause for a certain optimism .
This fundamental affirmation that the future for these countries lies within the European Union was reinforced and confirmed by the June 2005 European Council .
The Bosnian politicians , too , must at last get started on the institutional reforms that will make ethnic division a thing of the past and build a functioning state for which accession to the EU will be a real possibility .
As has already been said several times over , the existing constitutional – or rather institutional – framework is not up to the job .
That is why this structure will not work , even with the excessively bureaucratic addition of cantons .
We must do something to support them , such as making it easier for them to travel abroad , and part of the package that the European Union will put together for them will of course consist in making it easier to obtain visas .
There is no doubt about the fact that this was a clear and unambiguous expression of the European Union’s support for the democratic process in Belarus , even though the EU cannot , of course , endorse individual candidates .
It is understandable that the Commission cannot tell us today how it intends to divide up a budget that has not yet even been adopted , but I do believe that it certainly should be giving consideration to how to go about providing these trans-European networks with the funding that they will need .
It is also important for farmers themselves to be involved in this insurance , in other words for there to be cofinancing from the farms , so that we do not end up with state protection , replacing one system with the other , that is to say bringing
