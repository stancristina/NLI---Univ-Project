.
The Commissioner knows what I am talking about .
That is why we show solidarity with the actions , the amazement and the protest against the appointment of presidents or senators for life .
What needs to be done is not difficult to describe .
Mr Tshisekedi has expressed his willingness to cooperate , but Kabila has rejected this .
I think what matters now is that measures and actions are taken , that we not only take note of what is happening , but try to gain influence , for example through the pressure which can be applied by the European Union and the Member States .
The opportunities offered by the end of the cold war to get rid of large categories of weapons of mass destruction , are thus lost .
In the resolution on Greece we are not asking for money from the Diaster Fund , but from the Structural Funds , and therefore not the ECU 5 million from before .
I think this is a pity that Commissioner Monti is not with us here tonight , because I would like to have a seen a firmer commitment from the Commission to get serious about both deregulation , simplification and consolidation of European legislation .
The Council asks Parliament for its advice , but if it was up to him Parliament would refuse to give it .
Refusing to give one 's opinion reminds me of a petulant child which does not get what it wants , and therefore pushes aside everything it does get .
Bearing that in mind , there is much to be said for not letting the funding go via the Community budget .
How is this possible ?
It has now become clear that these arrangements are very disadvantageous to the European budget .
For instance 25 % , when it has been occurring for so many years .
I can therefore be satisfied with the fact that the total sum of subsidies and other financial support will amount to no more than the financial contribution .
Mr President , as Mrs Green said , the matter is still pending and has not been finalized by the Committee on Budgetary Control yet .
We are calling on Parliament to give us this opportunity , but we are prepared to vote on it at a later date .
The Taliban are using religion as a smoke screen to strip away all women 's rights .
I could include here countries such as Iran , where women 's rights are trampled on ; where nine-year-old girls are married off with one hand on the Koran , and where these same girls are subsequently raped by their brand new husbands , still brandishing the Koran .
In Algeria it is becoming increasingly difficult for women to hang on to the freedoms which they had acquired .
We in Western Europe are partly responsible for this situation .
But what can and must we , the European Union , the Commission , the Council and the Member States do to actually implement these paper tigers , these paper rights , these statements of principles ?
The Commission , as Mrs Bonino pointed out , must use its powers much more consistently .
You said yourself , Madam Commissioner , that Afghanistan was a symbol of the suppression of women throughout the world .
But a democracy cannot exist without respect for human and women 's rights .
I believe that with this hierarchy we have solved many of the problems for small and medium enterprises .
I think that , when the amendment to this section , Amendment No 31 , is supported by this entire House , we will have a solution to these problems .
Let expensive goods come under the scope of the directive , but allow for exceptions .
Finally , it will cause more waste , and this while the Commission is working on a document on competition in the recycling sectors .
I am referring to our Amendment 25 which was approved by a large majority in the Committee on Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection .
Each time a product is found to be faulty , the question will arise : was it already faulty or did the user break it ?
The report by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection clearly takes the side of the consumer when it comes to burden of proof .
If the legal guarantee is used too often to make claims , then there must be something wrong with the product .
Sadly , this balance is lacking in several places .
We insist that the seller 's right of recourse can be exercised effectively , and we would like to emphasize this as one of the essential conditions for our ultimate approval of this resolution .
It is also important that the issue of liability is developed further ; a proposal for this is ready and waiting at the European Commission .
Mr President , in exactly 297 days the euro will be introduced in the countries taking part in monetary union .
What must be avoided at all costs is that the introduction of the euro leads to a reinforcement of division within our society .
Statutory regulations will only be useful if and on condition that it is determined that optional dual pricing does not lead to the hoped-for result .
The small shopkeeper will be asked to play an important role in the changeover process .
It rightly appeals to Member States to bring their banking laws into line with the rules of the European System of Central Banks which will be in force from July .
On the one hand we smother small firms in words .
I would like to say a word about tourism .
Let us not promise each other any golden dreams as far as tourism is concerned
