These rules are in accordance with the latest developments within Community legislation on genetically modified organisms and , in particular , with the provisions of the draft regulation on traceability and marking .
The EU has played a key role in the international negotiations right from the beginning .
The Protocol is based on the precautionary principle and respects the right of states to have stricter national rules governing the trade in genetically modified products .
While existing EU rules would apply to imports , the proposed law would regulate exports from the EU.
We in Parliament should like to cooperate closely with the Commission and the Council to ensure that these laws are made ready as swiftly as possible .
It must not be possible to export seeds or products not approved for use within the European Union .
It must never be possible for a failure to respond to be interpreted as authorisation , as it in actual fact could be under the Commission 's proposed law .
It is also more in line with what is in actual fact prescribed by the Cartagena Protocol .
I therefore hope to see the adoption of as large a proportion as possible of the amendments by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , as well as of the amendments tabled jointly by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left , the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Party of European Socialists .
Mr President , I too wish to begin by thanking the Commission for its proposal and Mr Sj√∂stedt for his splendid and sterling work on confirming and clarifying what this matter is really about .
The Cartagena Protocol is designed to create a framework for international trade involving GMOs .
The Cartagena Protocol is , however , an agreement on biosafety .
This states that transboundary movement of genetically modified organisms should proceed 'in every case and at each stage on the basis of the precautionary principle ' .
We must help bring about a situation in which no compulsion is felt to receive such consignments .
The reason that the Cartagena Protocol came about is that GMOs and trade require special precautionary measures .
I support this report in its entirety .
The first is , of course , that we are concerned here with minimum regulations .
What I state in the report is that we shall respect this .
Secondly , we should be aware that the Cartagena Protocol is in the process of development .
Other areas have been clarified .
What is at issue is Article 27 of the Cartagena Protocol , which says that we must begin to negotiate internationally concerning liability where this type of product is concerned .
Amendment No 50 , in particular , actually goes against the Cartagena Protocol .
We cannot adopt that amendment .
Irrespective of how we regard the future of this technology , I think there is something we must bear in mind , namely that we must have a system of rules under which the companies that operate in this area are credible .
We do not stand to gain , and nor should industry stand to gain , from rules that lead to what is in actual fact the bypassing of countries ' right to say yes or no to would-be imports .
Even someone who takes a very positive view of this industry - complicated though it is , with both advantages and disadvantages - ought to appreciate that it is in everyone 's interests to have comprehensive , credible regulations .
As you know , we have presented a communication on how we should make use of biotechnology .
I was myself involved in the negotiations in which the EU was the party pushing to guarantee the introduction of international regulations .
It is important for different legal acts on biotechnology to tally .
Further attention will be given to this issue in international negotiations .
Amendment No 29 addresses more fundamental problems .
This part of the amendment cannot therefore be approved .
If we want it to be possible to implement the Protocol on Biosafety , we must , at the same time , be accountable for the feasibility of such implementation .
International discussions on the Protocol on Biosafety are still going on .
I hope that they will lead in time to a constructive exchange of opinions , but this is not the right time and place to touch on all these different aspects .
With reference to the precautionary principle , we believe that the country of import 's rules must be respected by the exporter .
In this context , it has been important also to be able to renew the debate itself , which is perhaps the most visible part of Parliament 's budgetary work .
Against this background , I welcome the way in which the Commission , the Council , a majority of Commissioners and the Danish Finance Minister in his Presidency role have taken part in the debate , and I hope that Parliament 's own representatives will also make substantial efforts to ensure that we obtain a more exciting and constructive debate than has been provided by the fairly predictable monologues delivered up until now .
Consequently , one of this year 's innovations is that we have tried more systematically to find and make use of unemployed resources and have contrived more systematically to bring expenditure forward in order to ease the pressure on a heavily burdened category over the next few years , something which might , for example , make it easier to meet the needs that exist prior to enlargement .
The incredibly inflexible budget ceilings we live with at present should not be turned into permanent fixtures .
I should like to round off this introduction by appealing for the
