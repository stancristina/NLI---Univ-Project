currently a temporary ceasefire will soon become a permanent one .
This Resolution therefore urges the Commission and the Council once again to insist that the Chinese Government , taking advantage of the particularly privileged relations we have at the moment , accept that Taiwan should have observer status in the World Health Organisation , or at least in the World Health Assembly .     Mr President , the other day in my country , a great Europeanist – Fernando Álvarez de Miranda – told me that the Europeans ’ problem is that they have lost their excitement about Europe .
That would show them what the European Union is , Mr President .     – Mr Verhofstadt , I believe that today you have written the next chapter of your book , which I , like many others , read with great attention and pleasure .
I would say to you that , since the Constitution was drawn up amongst governments and parliaments within a Convention , this crisis must be resolved amongst governments and parliaments .
Finally , we once again call upon the Bush Government to close the Guantánamo detention centre and to give the people held there a fair trial or release them immediately , ensuring that they are not sent to any country where they may be subject to torture , as has apparently happened in some cases .
This Parliament will play no part in it .     Madam President , when we discussed and adopted the urgent resolution on Guantánamo a few months ago , it marked a turning point in the debate and we condemned a practice which until then had been completely denied or simply ignored by the powers that be in Europe .
In the face of totalitarianism and lack of freedom , there is no option but to have a strong and solid alliance with our natural partners , the United States : that is the only alliance that has produced , and will continue to produce , results .
Furthermore , we hope that the next United States-European Union summit , to be held in June in Vienna , will provide a clear impetus for intensifying our relations in the economic field as well .
Of course , the candidates for joining the eurozone must prepare themselves for fulfilling the criteria laid down in the Treaty , since the Treaty of Maastricht .
I must tell you that it is not the same : the European Central Bank’s objective of maintaining price stability in the eurozone below 2 % inflation , but close to it , is one thing , but the Treaty’s inflation criterion , which states that candidates for joining the eurozone must have an average inflation rate over the last twelve months below the reference value , which is the inflation of the three best performing countries in terms of inflation , plus 1.5 % , is quite another .
We do so regardless of whether those who are to join the eurozone over the coming years are new or old Member States – a distinction which we believe belongs in the past – or whether they be large or small , rich or not so rich .
What does the Treaty say about the inflation criterion , which has been discussed in the debate ?
The Treaty 's inflation criterion says something else though : it also says that the inflation of the Member State in question must be sustainable .
We apply the Treaty , but we apply all aspects of it , not just the bits that are in our interest , and when applying it , we learn from our experience , within the margin for interpretation permitted by the Treaty .
Tomorrow we will approve the report on the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue ( 2008 ) , an initiative that will undoubtedly promote dialogue amongst all cultures and people of different origins residing in the European Union . 2008 will contribute to integration and cohesion within our societies , as well as peaceful governance throughout the international community .
This report comes at an extremely appropriate time .
We are often accused of producing endless legislative texts that are difficult to transpose , but that view is usually a poor excuse from national governments that have not been diligent in their compliance with the Community legislation .
We all agree that Europe is faced with the effects of climate change , the rising crude prices and the tension with Russia over the supply of gas .
For example , it points to the importance of access to reproductive health services , particularly in war and post-war situations and , especially , in refugee camps ; it stresses the need to tackle violence against women ; it demands that acts of sexual violence , such as rape , sexual slavery , forced pregnancy , forced prostitution and forced sterilisation , amongst other practices , be treated as war crimes and crimes against humanity ; and it calls for the women who are victims of these practices to be able to take their cases directly to international judicial bodies .
What it says exactly is : ‘The Commission shall ensure complementarity with the work of the United Nations High-Level Group for the Alliance of Civilisations and any other initiative for cooperation with third continues , in particular developing countries , which is relevant to the intercultural dialogue objectives of this European Year’ .     Mr President , I believe that , when deciding on this sitting , the Conference of Presidents did not take account of the fact that the EU-ACP Joint Parliamentary Assembly would be meeting in Vienna on the same day and that 78 Members of this House will not therefore be able to attend one of the two events : either the extraordinary sitting being scheduled or the plenary sitting of the Joint Assembly , which we are obliged to attend .
