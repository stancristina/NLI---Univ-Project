, at the same time as preserving flexibility and a high level of safety .     Mr President , allow me firstly to say that the report is constructive and provides a correct description of the work in the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly .
I personally should like to emphasise the constructive cooperation between the ACP-EU Assembly and the UN when it comes both to child soldiers and children’s vulnerability in war and to the debate concerning the International Criminal Court .
These are two major and important political issues of precisely the kind that our Assembly should engage with , for they are about finding sound forms of cooperation in which both sides learn from each other and support the policy we consider to be important in the international arena .
It is gratifying to note that , of the Latin American and West Indian countries , it is only Belize that has given in to the US’s action and , of the African countries , only Nigeria , whose President ratified an agreement with the United States that was contrary to the Nigerian constitution and in defiance of the Nigerian Parliament .
The high living standards and prosperity achieved by the western world , Japan and Australia are not the results of monopoly and protectionism but of the free market economy ’s and private enterprise’s many dynamic forces that promote development and prosperity .
It is a lesson that we ought , indeed have an obligation to , pass on to countries that wish to construct democratic welfare societies .
On the contrary , the problem has been too little in the way of free economies and too much in the way of monopolies , something that has led to mismanagement , corruption and stagnation .
The developing countries naturally need regulations that provide a legal framework , and perhaps this is an area in which the EU can be of great help to the developing countries .
He is well informed and takes a positive view of agriculture .
Allow me to address a number of points I think are important .
A discrepancy arises that can be resolved with the help of rationalisation , but not to an unlimited degree .
We have defended the agricultural reform .
When the agricultural reform is implemented at different speeds , there is a danger of making further changes to competitiveness or of creating an uneven playing field in the different countries where competitiveness is concerned .
I must , however , address a number of aspects of this report that I do not think are as good .
It is rather anti-reform , if I may say so .
I do not believe it is realistic to retain far-reaching market regulation or prices set by politicians , nor to have a regulated supply of the type we have involving quotas .
We cannot vote in favour of this report but , in view of all the plus points I mentioned at the beginning , we cannot vote against it , either .
We believe that the Commission ’s proposals on important points are better than the European Parliament’s proposals , which is why we choose to support the Commission ’s proposals .     All the Christian Democratic proposals by the Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats having been , in principle , adopted in plenary , thereby considerably improving the content of the report , I have voted in favour of the latter in the final vote .
Reforms in this sector can therefore contribute to improvements and growth .
Clear legal framework regulations must stand as guarantees of the right to services for the benefit of all .
In a Europe in which 50 % of farmers are over 55 years of age and only eight per cent under 35 , a whole new attitude to agriculture’s entrepreneurs is required .
A second point emphasises the importance of ‘maintain[ing ] the level of public support for agriculture ’ and the significance of creating ‘conditions that will guarantee employment ’ and so forth .
Restructuring is taking place incredibly quickly .
I am doing so today too .
I think that the proposal that has now been negotiated by the Committee on Fisheries is very poor .
That is something we should appreciate .
We have now rejected four or five recovery plans from the Commission .
I should like more people to fall in with my policy when we vote on this matter , for I am now beginning to become extremely impatient and anxious .     Mr President , I wish to address a number of subjects I think are related to the drugs issue .
I also wish to put a follow-up question concerning the projected European Corps of Border Guards .
Parliament will therefore , of course , apply pressure in this area .
I shall conclude by putting a question , not because I cannot work out what the Commissioner thinks but because I want a clear answer , which I intend to use in the election campaign in relation to the governments .
The second answer is that the Member States usually want to exert influence upon the day-to-day activities of any strong institution they create .
I chose the more rapid solution , because all the current crises concerning network security have shown that we must take prompt measures .     Thank you very much , Mr Liikanen , for an absolutely excellent and very interesting answer .
We cannot go on like this .
The industry has made great progress , but there are big differences between one EU country and another in terms of IT sophistication .
We have made certain progress in cooperation , for example the common telephone number 112 , which makes things easier in the event of road accidents
