European educational policy must be developed in such a way that it supports the movement of Union citizens and their mutual interaction .
Mr President , Mr von Wogau , with characteristic expertise , has produced a balanced report on guidelines for the Community ' s economic policy .
Neither is this plea made in Mr von Wogau ' s report .
I do not accept that staff should not be told about structural changes and job losses as early on as possible , but if there is any intention of evolving a directive from the Marks & Spencer case , one that would essentially slow down the conversion of companies , I am against it .
Nor , apparently , will the position regarding air transport become clear for years to come , and internal bolts have been drawn to prevent the advance of genuine , pan-European public procurement , which will tend to have a hampering effect on the real efficiency that results from genuine competition .
The UMTS auctions were an unfortunately good example of how governments are also managing to shoot Europe and themselves in the foot in the building of an eEurope .
In this way we are also moving towards a new phase in environmental policy , which is one of already taking account of the demands of the environment at the product design stage .
Our group would have liked to see rather more determined action to try to get rid of especially hazardous chemical substances .
There has been discussion on whether halogenated flame retardants should be banned in future .
In our opinion , it is quite obvious that they are toxic , as they have , for example , led to a situation where mother ' s milk contains double the amount of these halogenated chromium compounds every five years .
For that reason , the decisions we now have to take are particularly important .
It will create incentives for more ecologically friendly design and innovations before products have even come onto the market , and will therefore lessen the environmental burden of products for their entire life cycle .
If the directive requires printed circuit boards to always be removed , for example , it will not create incentives for the development of materials used in printed circuit boards .
Under the directive , they will have to be removed in any case .
Only this sort of approach will act as any real incentive in eco-design .
The amendment I tabled with this in mind had already been adopted in the Annex by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , but the corresponding amendment to the Article is contained in Amendment No 76 submitted for the plenary sitting .
What is your opinion of these electoral promises ?
Do you think it is possible that the Commission would consider issuing this sort of warning with regard to Italy too , if that country takes an interest in or engages in an expansive economic policy in a situation in which the euro zone really does have inflation pressures , or do these intended warnings only concern the small Member States in the euro zone , such as Ireland ?
Question No 50 by (H-0385/01 ) : Subject : Coordination of EU 's views in the IMF and World Bank Informal discussions with Europeans working at the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have revealed that there is no coordination of EU action within those bodies .
The reports focus attention on the essential factors in increasing maritime safety .
The Council has incorporated in its general position a large number of the amendments adopted at Parliament ' s first reading .
With regard to the directive on Port State control , the problem is the black boxes , which we must hurry to fit in vessels .
There must be a black box on all ships , but financial reality makes it necessary to seek solutions wherein present cargo vessels could be equipped with technically simplified black boxes .
Expanded inspections must be made of high-risk vessels in particular .
I still nevertheless wish to draw attention to the fact that decisions made solely within the Union to increase maritime safety are not enough .
Mr President , Madam President-in-Office , Commissioner , transatlantic relations seem to have drifted into quite a difficult situation .
We can undoubtedly learn from the United States some other time , when there is occasion to do so , so this is not a question of anti-Americanism , but one of factual discussion .
It would seem to me that what unites the European Union and the United States above all is the fact that together we are responsible , to a considerable extent , for global development , as together we make up the world ' s largest trading blocs .
In this regard the Council and the Commission are also to be praised for the fact that during the Stockholm Summit Prime Minister Persson and President of the Commission , Mr Prodi , sent a letter to the President of the United States that emphasised the importance of the Kyoto Protocol and stated in particular that its policy on climate is an essential ingredient in our understanding of transatlantic relations , and no minor issue .
I might imagine that this tanker of ours ought to have the world ' s best environmentally friendly technology , and , as Mr Cox said , it should at least have a double bottom , its engine should be very powerful and its fuel as clean as possible - preferably solar energy , if possible , Commissioner .
My group is very concerned that in the United States there is an intention to use global resources for a missile defence system .
Mr President , first I would like to thank Mr Ferber for an excellent report .
