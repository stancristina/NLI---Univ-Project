points that were settled and on others that still have to be resolved is still vulnerable and , in fact , the specific character of sport in general and of football in particular will not be safeguarded until they are clearly and specifically recognised in the Treaties .
What such initiatives cannot do , and this is what concerns Parliament , is to make up for the inconsistencies between the Member States which lead to such a legislative mire , with each Member State doing its own thing with initiatives to suit its own taste , without a genuine Community vision and ignoring their joint responsibility .
Up to now , international cooperation on the taking of evidence has been governed by the Hague Convention of 1970 , the scope of which is limited since it only applies to those Member States that have ratified the Convention .
Lastly , in view of these innovative arrangements , which will greatly speed up the proceedings of courts in all the Member States , which seems to me to be one of the key aims of the German initiative , I have proposed that only in exceptional circumstances should the direct contact between courts envisaged in the regulation be superseded by traditional consular channels , which I believe are inevitably cumbersome , bureaucratic , somewhat remote from events and in many ways responsible for the delays in litigation in cross-border disputes or proceedings .
By virtue of this specific reference in the Treaty , this question was included by the Council in the Vienna Action Plan , in the conclusions of the Tampere European Council , and it was subsequently covered in the Commission 's scoreboard for the establishment of a common area of freedom , security and justice .
Accordingly , this regulation will enhance the value of European citizenship and of protecting and guaranteeing our citizens ' individual rights , and it is also of not insignificant economic importance , in that by facilitating the taking of evidence , it will make swifter and more effective administration of justice more economically viable , and in particular administration of justice more in line with the necessities of a new economic reality , of the single market , the single currency and electronic democracy .
We therefore welcome the support the rapporteur has given to this initiative .
According to the latest information available , the scheme for adulterating butter set up by a number of Camorra families in Naples produced 130 000 tonnes of totally or partially artificial butter .
This also makes it more urgent for the Commission to adopt direct measures to combat the adulteration of products such as olive oil , wine and dairy produce .
This proposal for a directive is intended to replace the 1990 directive .
To this end , the Commission plans this month to adopt a working document on the mutual recognition of decisions on parental responsibility .
But on the other hand , there is scope for Member States to adopt the Convention and therefore we think they should do it without delay .
So we need to incorporate the fact that the communitarisation of the subjects of the Convention give the Commission and the Community exclusive external competence .
Otherwise , we will be in danger of repeating the same mistakes , the same frustrations and the same failures .
These issues concern our citizens and the future of the Nation-States very closely , and I would therefore say that what we need most of all at the moment is not so much a European debate but 15 in-depth national debates .
This is what differentiates a centre for discussion from an institution which is able to implement and make policy .
Firstly , is it prepared to review the date for drafting this Treaty ?
We do not want to replace national governments and we do not wish to take decisions - you are the decision makers - but I should like to ask , why are you afraid of our ideas , our proposals and our contribution ?
This report offers very limited options for effectively reducing emissions of pollutants and for protecting the environment and public health , since the limits that are proposed , which are extremely modest , are a clear compromise in favour of economic interests .
Water is a product that is essential to life itself .
Portugal and Spain are in quite unequal positions , given that we are a downstream country , in other words , Portugal has no rivers that flow into Spain , but Spain does have rivers that flow into Portugal .
I therefore ask you , Madam President , to take measures to ensure that the individuals representing this group leave the European Parliament immediately .
Nevertheless , the guidelines do not add to the main legislative initiatives laid down in the Social Agenda , specifically those that provided for increasing workers ' individual and collective rights and for improving their working conditions .
It continues to predict a healthy economic situation , despite signs that the EU' s economy is slowing down , as the rapporteur himself states , when we should be thinking about the slowdown of the US economy , the economic recession in Japan and the effects of these trends on the European economy .
The economic and monetary policy of the EU and its Member States should be directed towards continued improvements to the quality of their citizens ' lives and meeting their needs to an increasing degree .
Furthermore , in terms of medicines and patenting them , developing countries and the poorest parts of the population are being excluded , which is what is happening , unacceptably , as a result of the behaviour of multinationals in Brazil and South Africa .
This is a moderate motion , which is designed to condemn the unacceptable fact that innocent people have been kidnapped for political ends .
