ahead .
All the instruments on the table try to strike the right balance between proactive and positive actions towards migrants and asylum-seekers on the one hand , and on the other hand , guaranteeing the security of the borders and adequate management of migratory flows .
In the field of civil liberties , there is permanent tension between the guarantee of fundamental rights and the guarantee of security .
It is in the name of freedom that we say we should be more efficient in integrating legal migrants .
To be frank with you , when we talk about introducing biometrics in some travel documents , we need to be very careful in guaranteeing that we are proportionate in the kind of data that we choose , in the types of data storage systems and in the types of control and supervision carried out by the necessary authorities .
I thank Mr Ribeiro e Castro and Mr Coelho for drawing attention to the fact that in order to fulfil our ambitious goals , we need to have the necessary financial tools .
I look forward to the debate on this subject that has been suggested by Mr Hernández Mollar , and the Commission will come forward with its own ideas in a new communication in June 2004 .     .
The overall figures also hide major disparities , such as the fact that 20 % of farms receive 73 % of CAP aid .
Pluriactivity and diversification have also helped to maintain agricultural incomes .
Agriculture has a major impact on the climate , on soils , on biodiversity , on the balance of ecosystems and on landscape management ; in other words , there is strong environmental interaction .
Other areas in which research is crucial are GM crops and biotechnology .
I therefore voted in favour of the report .     .
In terms of traceability , hygiene control and quality of ingredients , considerable investment is still required in order to raise quality levels and to maintain competitiveness .
The idea of consolidating all professional regulations in one single directive , taking account of the particular characteristics of each of these – doctors , veterinary surgeons , nurses , obstetricians , architects and dentists – is acceptable , since life , health and the safety of persons and effects are at stake .
In addition , there will be gains in terms of road safety and environmental protection .
The rapporteur feels that this measure is disproportionate and suggests only a management plan .
The report now before us concerns the review of the Directive on the organisation of working time : reference periods and self-exclusion clauses , better known as ‘opt-out ’ clauses .
Meanwhile the informal economy flourishes , along with the criminalisation of the economy , in which shady dealing becomes increasingly prominent , to the detriment of social and economic development .
In the past few years alone , a number of financial scandals have taken place – Enron , WorldCom and Merck , in the United States ; Crédit Lyonnais , Vivendi , Ahold , Kirch , Marconi and Equitable Life in EU Member States – which have had a devastating social and economic impact .
In the case of Parmalat , compensation should be immediately considered for those milk producers affected .
Consequently , I ask you once again what measures the Council must take to intervene in order to uphold the rights of this mother and this wife , so that they may be able to visit their relatives held totally unjustly in US prisons .     Mr President , it is appropriate to reiterate that Parliament , the Commission and the Council reacted quickly and efficiently to the tragic accidents involving the and oil tankers off the European coastline .
We have always said that the Member States must coordinate their efforts when accidents happen .
Thirdly the most contentious issue concerns the agency’s activities in the area of security , since the Commission ’s original proposal appeared to impinge on the Member States’ competences in matters of national security and the fight against terrorism .
This would , in turn , raise questions of sovereignty , leading to conflicts of competences .
In such circumstances , the agency may provide support , but should not replace Member States .
Those who cross the seas as a matter of course must be held responsible at all times for the state of the ships , for the people who work on them and for those employed in the sector on land .
It is only by understanding the means and the motives of actions , and by holding those involved responsible that we will , in my view , be able to ensure that each step taken will be safer and more confident than the one before .
Coming from Portugal , and having strong links to the sea , I believe that the European Maritime Safety Agency will always be a challenge for ...     Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I , too , wish to say that I welcome the report and that I join in the congratulations accorded to the rapporteur , Mr Mastorakis .
If there is a problem here it is certainly not that the proposals are too bold ; it is that they are too tentative .
Given the importance of the aims of the MEDIA programme , we broadly welcome the report and the extension until 2006 requested by the Commission .
These form the Community support mechanism for the audiovisual sector and replace the MEDIA I and MEDIA II programmes , which were launched , respectively , in 1991 and 1996 .
I should like to highlight two points that I consider to be of great importance : - complete support for extending the competences of the European Maritime Safety Agency to include the fight against pollution .
