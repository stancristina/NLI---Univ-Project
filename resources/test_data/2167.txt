I am in favour of any discussion on development cooperation , provided this is done on the basis of the agreements which Europe has reached with the 48 poorest countries and after we have considered the implications for the European farmers and farmers in developing countries .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to start by thanking the shadow rapporteurs , Mr Goodwill from the Christian Democrats , Mr Langen from the Socialists and Mrs Thors from the Liberals .
In my own country , the Netherlands , for example , only 10 % of the environment is protected against acidification , which leaves 90 % that is not .
We will then clean up those sea-going vessels in one fell swoop and not take any half measures .
In my view , this scrubbing technique works very well .
All sea-going ships together account for 20 % of these particles .
There is a plan to cushion the negative social and economic impact of restructuring , which is necessary and unavoidable .
The Member States also have an important role to play , not only by handing out subsidies but also by changing policy , setting up new tasks and creating new opportunities for the sector in society .
In 1999 , after the Kosovo war , the European Union set up the so-called stabilisation and association process , based on an analysis of the problems in the 1990s : ethnic violence , extreme nationalism and the need to develop democratic structures .
This too is possible in the Western Balkans , as is the step-by-step introduction of the change in visa policy , which Baroness Ludford has previously mentioned .
Mr President , Mr Prodi , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , one very important point for the European Council in Thessaloniki : bring Europe out of the closed back rooms of governments and give it back to its citizens .
Europe , that means making a policy for European citizens so that we can create an area of security , solidarity and prosperity for all .
Start by ensuring in particular that the content is in order and then provide for an adequate democratic structure through a debate about the institutions .
I did try to incorporate this in this resolution , but I think that we will have every opportunity to include our need to accept responsibility for the dismantlement of these ships as well in the Sterckx report .
( NL ) The reimbursement of Members ' travel expenses must be based on the expenses actually incurred and all Members must receive the same salary .
Many of the things that Parliament is adopting with the Rothley report on the Statute for Members of the European Parliament , such as the late entry into force in 2009 and the subordination of future fellow Members from the accession countries , I do not like .
( NL ) For a century , the generation and distribution of electricity was largely kept out of the hands of commerce .
Payment for green power , which consumers are allowed to buy from a different producer from their traditional regional supplier , usually leads to chaos .
Since 1996 the opportunities to catch fish in the area in question have fallen sharply .
For the other candidate Member States that was really self-evident .
The army also has a very strong influence in education , broadcasting and the business community and it is very important that this is also recognised in part in Turkey 's latest reform packages .
It must not for example make any difference in legal position whether you live in Diyarbakir or in Rotterdam .
Furthermore , the army must relinquish its present dominant position and be brought back to a form and function that is usual in other Member States .
For a while it seemed that the government would indeed be able to establish its authority and we had also hoped that it would , for example , be able to make good its intention to resolve the Cyprus issue on the basis of the UN plan .
I should like to point out however that it is not only the task of the military to keep Muslim radicalism at bay , but of all responsible leaders .
A drastic softening of Turkey 's attitude to the Cyprus problem is also needed .
Here what was - I have to say - an unbalanced report , whose tone was not always exactly upbeat , was transformed by radical amendments into one that is critical yet balanced , one in which a clear distinction is made between on the one hand what has been achieved and on the other the undoubtedly long , but concrete list of points that have still to happen .
It is in fact one of a constant struggle between , on the one hand , the reformers - strong in the government and in Parliament - and on the other , the conservatives - strong in the army , the police and the judiciary .
I believe that Turkey can implement the reforms , I think that they deserve our support .
Three fundamental inconsistencies with the political criteria of Copenhagen - which are , after all , essential accession conditions - are all-important in this connection : firstly , the army 's dominant position in the Turkish state and society , for which , see paragraphs 7 , 8 and 9 ; secondly , the constant discrimination against religious minorities , particularly that of Christian denominations ( paragraph 39 ) ; and thirdly , the disturbing Kurdish issue , mentioned in paragraphs 34 , 35 and 43 .
A helping hand of this kind to Turkey would do the Kurdish citizens a world of good , both internally and externally , and I would add this for the sake of Mr Oostlander ,
