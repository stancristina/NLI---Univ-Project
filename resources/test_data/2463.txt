Yet at the same time you say that it is necessary to invest in the future and in human resources , but what exactly do you mean by that ?
On the one hand you are bringing pressure to bear on them to step up austerity measures in public expenditure , but on the other hand you seem to be coming round to the point of view that it is necessary to invest in the future .
Is it not the case that many of the expenditure cuts which you are urging upon these ten countries will , on the contrary , weaken social security and reduce the human resources which you wish to support ?
How is it possible - as happens in a number of countries - to adopt such a bizarre approach as to impose on small businesses much the same bureaucracy and obligations as on large ones , for example employers ' contributions , book-keeping , value added tax , accounts , audits , compulsory insurance and so on ?
We need a Union programme to help SMEs to become networked in the internal market .
At present , any enterprise which recruits a new employee is penalized for doing so .
Taxation is concentrated on labour , rendering it expensive .
This has led to a situation in which recruitment of people is penalized and the replacement of people with machines is promoted .
This would promote labour-intensive enterprise and employment .
In addition , the Council has proposed transferring ECU 1 billion from 1998 to 1999 .
If both proposals had been adopted , it would have resulted in an accumulation of Structural Fund commitment appropriations in the last year of the programme period .
It was therefore sensible to divide the ECU 1 billion transfer into two and spread it between the last two years of the programme period .
Altogether , ECU 4.3 billion has been transferred to a later year - a sum which can only be described as substantial .
Regional and structural policies therefore face greater challenges than in the past .
Another obstacle is the strict rules governing the Structural Funds .
The requirement for projects to be innovative is often excessive , as is the slowness with which investment is supported .
If regional and structural policies were viable and effective , this would be reflected in competition for EU Structural Fund resources .
However , one cannot help observing that the report says nothing at all about one vital dimension of cooperation , which is even of decisive importance in ensuring maritime safety .
The report devotes ample attention to the very same hazards to maritime safety which seamen 's unions have spent decades trying to combat .
These are inadequate or non-existent training of crews , defective vessels and the resultant substandard working conditions , which mean that crews ' motivation cannot be optimal , and many other similar matters .
At a time when the European Union is adopting a new maritime strategy and trying to influence world standards , there is every reason to hope that this dimension will be utilized to the full in the further consideration of the subject .
By means of a common decision and agreement and sufficiently effective supervision , it should be possible to regulate these market forces in such a way as to ensure that the maximization of purely short-term economic advantage is not allowed to threaten maritime safety .
On behalf of the Economic Affairs Committee I entirely agree with the rapporteur that some kind of regulation is needed .
I do , however , understand the rapporteur 's point of view when he says that this is a very courageous idea .
It will not be very easy to get it accepted in the Member States .
This issue also raises very difficult questions relating to the compensation and sanctions to be laid down for uses not complying with the cancellation arrangements .
The Environment Committee wishes to know how the prevention of the use of encrypted services would lead , for example , to their being cut off .
This growth in demand is creating an entirely new market with higher prices for agricultural producers .
In the EU we have been striving for years to attain a better balance between the production and consumption of agricultural products .
An organic , less efficient means of using the soil and producing plants and animals will itself promote the achievement of a better balance between supply and demand of agricultural products .
In complying with these regulations , transparency , high moral standards and business ethics will be required of everyone involved in the production chain .
The Liberal Group considers organic , environmentally acceptable agricultural production , meeting growing consumer demand , to be particularly important .
The consumer must always be informed of the origin , production methods and distribution of the product .
The report , as a result of the numerous votes in committee , is partly contradictory and illogical .
In some places the report contains detailed provisions and in other places there is a complete lack of concrete rules .
In Finland , where the conditions for organic farming are excellent , a person going over to organic production needs a three-year transition period , whereas the report is content with twelve months .
On a genuine organic farm the production of fodder crops should also take place on the farm , because the fact of fodder crops passing through intermediaries creates one further risk .
Mr President , pure food produced near the consumer is an important absolute value for Europeans .
For this reason I should like to thank the rapporteur .
For example , not enough attention has been paid to the EU 's northern dimension .
Initiatives towards uniform taxation are , however , going too far .
Thus , for example
