can devise some methods of verification on the basis of which the directive will serve the intended purposes .
There is no point in adopting a directive if it does not work .
New resources are being deployed and energy-saving aeroplanes are being introduced , and indeed that is a good thing .
That shows how greatly this directive is needed .
I very much hope that we can agree on something that works .
This is in fact my greatest concern .
Mr President , I would also like to congratulate Mr Medina and Mrs Fontaine on a good result .
I think the standstill decision is a good thing .
The conflict between spare parts manufacturers and motor vehicle manufacturers will certainly continue for a long time to come .
The consultation exercise and voluntary agreements may perhaps lead to a new and final directive and put an end to the antagonism .
Especially not when we consider the scope of the directive and the multiplicity of industries to be covered .
I want to thank especially Mr Sarlis from the PPE Group for ensuring that the amendments tabled by the Committee on Budgetary Control were put forward .
I must say how surprised I am that the Commission has not contributed any input of its own on decentralisation .
The question was also taken up in the Agenda 2000 papers .
It is odd when people say one thing and do another .
Hence it is for us in the European Parliament to hold the Commission to the things it has promised and the commitments it has stated .
What is important about decentralisation is that it serves to convey a clear political will to help Eastern and Central European countries qualify for EU membership .
In addition these are recommendations which will find favour with the Court of Auditors , because they involve changes which may help us overcome some of the problems currently experienced in the management of the PHARE programme .
They serve to give a clear signal that we want to promote enlargement .
The reason for that is that a race against time has been built into the Protocol .
In the USA , for example , the postponement of ratification by three years will mean that the annual reduction effort almost doubles .
Such a decision will only serve the interests of those who want to see the Kyoto Protocol overturned .
It will not be many years before proposals for a renegotiation of the commitments can be expected to find favour .
This Parliament should not just give its formal support to the work on climate , but should also make an especially concrete contribution to seeing that the results attained are converted into progress in the real world .
I think it is a directive which moves in the right direction , and it also moves in the right direction at a more primary level .
This directive relates to matters which have to be tackled in the individual countries ; it does not concern itself with any particular action to be taken at Community level .
So I think this is a good step .
It is important that we include environmental considerations at an early stage , and that is just not happening at present .
I always think that , when we discuss the environmental policy , we demand incredibly little - this applies on occasion to the PPE Group - in respect of investigations to be undertaken as regards the effects of plans on the environment , compared with what we demand when the effect of plans on the economy is at issue .
Mr Florenz , I did not say that it was always the case , but it certainly is occasionally .
In this instance , I have to say that I disagree with what Mrs Jackson said .
They are in fact two sides of the same question , if we really want to establish sustainable development .
I am deputising for Jonas Sj√∂stedt in putting his question .
I want to ask whether it is not right that Sweden , regardless of the terms of the Treaty , should enjoy the same status as Germany following the Karlsruhe judgment , under which Germany acquired the right through a decision of the Bundestag to decide for itself whether it wanted to participate in the third stage of monetary union or not .
We know the list from the budget , but we do not know every committee .
We demand that all funds for meetings should be placed in budget reserves and the money released once we have been given sufficient information .
The committees should serve the voters ; their agendas , working documents and reports should therefore also be available to the voters .
If legitimate interests call for confidentiality , those interests can be stated and access can be limited , for example , to the chairman of the committee , rapporteurs and an individual spokesman from each group .
It should also be a principle that matters from a committee can be put onto the agenda of the Council of Ministers .
The essence of democracy is that we can vote in elections and get new laws .
Then only the Commission can put a matter back on the agenda of the Council of Ministers .
Parliament nevertheless voted in favour , in order to show confidence in Turkey .
The answer is ready to hand .
Very little .
Let me give a few examples : arbitrary arrests , critics of the system who suddenly disappear , prisoners dying in political detention , laws which set aside the personal rights of ordinary people for up to three years , 6000 Kurds murdered in 1997 alone , prisoners of conscience like former Member of Parliament Leyla Zana , who was sentenced to 15 years in prison without evidence
