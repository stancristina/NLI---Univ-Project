hope that we Finns will now get at least one .
And then , might we not still hope for hot water in the pipes , which has not been available during this new Parliament ' s term of office ?
What is the problem with you bureaucrats , that you cannot sort these things out in this House ?
Mr President , the two directives on supervision of the business of electronic money institutions are of the utmost importance to the development of e-commerce in the European Union .
The common position reflects a compromise that has been reached after long negotiations in the Council .
I made a compromise proposal which , unfortunately , was not accepted in my political group .
I do not think we could reach a conclusion that would serve the interests of all the parties concerned better than this common position does .
That would mean that the situation would remain uncertain from the consumers ' point of view .
I am also afraid that by emphasising the position of the European Central Bank in terms of monetary stability control we will cause difficult problems for the Member States which do not belong to the euro-zone .
Amendments Nos 1 and 2 add the words "at par value " to the report .
In this latter case the additional words would add nothing and be misleading to the consumer .
Adding the words "at par value " to Article 3( 1 ) may mislead the consumer since it is always possible to deduct the charges that are strictly necessary to carry out that operation .
The waiver is possible in cases where the total amount of e-money issued is limited and where the e-money issued is accepted as a means of payments by only a limited number of undertakings .
In addition , the waived schemes will not benefit from the Single Market passport provisions .
Furthermore , these national limited schemes will not be unsupervised since the text requires any waiver to be subject to a separate decision by the supervisory authorities .
It was clear in the Council that the price for having a directive was that a waiver would need to be included as an option .
The Council was able to agree its common position only because it felt that a directive , which included a waiver but tightened regulation and permitted competition in a single market , was better than no directive at all .
The sooner the directive is adopted and implemented , the sooner the improved regulation will take effect .
Therefore I do not believe that the European Parliament should adopt any amendments or there is a risk that the whole directive may be lost .
I would like to draw your attention to some of the issues that have been raised in this opinion of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy .
Now we are talking about allowing the use of a few new additives .
The rapporteur and the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy have , however , treated the proposal heavy-handedly and are proposing that the use of most of the new additives mentioned in the Commission ' s proposal be rejected .
The Scientific Committee for Food has delivered a favourable report on proposals by Member States concerning additives .
Should not the question of innovations and the use of better additives , as well as competitiveness of the European food industry , be given greater consideration ?
If the report is adopted in the form in which it has been presented , could not the adoption procedure regarding new additives be reformed once and for all and the whole additives list revised ?
Mr President , the issue of discharge is an immense one for the institutions of the EU.
Its importance is evident in the fact that in many cases it is now being proposed that the discharge should be postponed .
As the Member States , that is to say the Council , has advocated discharge , this is almost a matter of structural conflict .
The reports concerning discharge show just how badly administrative reforms are needed .
Administration and auditing must go hand in hand to preserve a sense of personal responsibility and help it grow .
Improving the quality of administration is a basic requirement for a greater sense of responsibility and better efficiency .
Increased control is only a reflection of the fact that the organisation has failed .
This is because agricultural aid is largely based either on land area or the number of livestock , and the Member State in question pays it .
At the same time , the European farmers have become the most closely observed section of the population on the Continent , and , for that reason , I am hoping for a lucid clarification of the agricultural aid system at the forthcoming WTO talks .
We must act in such a way that EU property is treated with the same respect as other property .
According to the budget , this investigation will be given to an independent expert .
What has happened to this investigation , why has it not got under way , and what is going to be done about it ?
Madam President , Mr Gama , President Prodi , with good reason the Lisbon Summit could be dubbed historic in terms of its political content .
I will borrow the words of the Presidency .
The Union will act as a catalyst in the process .
Fourthly , we must speed up the process whereby competition is freed up , for example , in the gas , electricity , postal and transport industries , with the objective of having a fully functional internal market in these sectors too
