In a Union enlarged to 25 countries , the instruments of cohesion policy must be provided with the appropriate financial resources , which must in turn be distributed fairly among the least favoured regions , not only of the ‘new ’ Member States but also the ‘old ’ ones .
Nonetheless , we must recognise the enormously positive effect that this fund has had on Portugal and must focus on the rules that will apply to it in times ahead .
Steps taken to reduce difficulties in managing cross-border , transnational and inter-regional cooperation are therefore of particular importance .
The European Social Fund ( ESF ) has always played a key role in European development , albeit with certain changes of direction over time with regard to its areas of intervention .
For that matter , Portugal has been a privileged witness to this success .
Increasing the budget earmarked for this Fund will play a key role in ensuring support for small-scale , traditional coastal fishing , securing investment in renewing and modernising the fleet , taking socio-economic measures to compensate for the reduced fishing effort , financing recovery plans , and providing support for aquaculture-related industrial and commercial activities , with the involvement of fishermen and their associations , in line with the co-management principle .
After all , Portugal must not forget that there are major conurbations in its coastal areas – due to the country ’s history and geography – and there would be no justification for excluding those areas from Community support .
Furthermore , if we are to achieve equality between women and men , changes applicable to both men and women will need to be made .
I therefore give my backing to the report on the Commission proposal aimed at modernising and simplifying Community law in the area of equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation .
The rapporteur rightly points out that it has not yet been possible to put an end to inequality between men and women .
This is a report that seeks to expunge the ‘past ’ ( which is after all the brutal present ) ; a report that calls for ‘more multilateral ’ ‘conflict management’ , by which it means the invasion ; a report that equates the Iraqi people’s legitimate resistance with ‘terrorism’ ; a report that glosses over the torture carried out by the USA , calling it ‘violations of rights ’ ; a report that hypocritically , calls on Iraq’s neighbours not to interfere in the country ’s affairs , without a single word of condemnation of the USA’s invasion and occupation ; a report that seeks to share that occupation and plunder with the USA , under the UN umbrella ; a report that , in an appalling act of meddling , advocates implanting capitalism , its instruments and its policies .
The important matter for debate now is what role the EU should have at this stage of Iraq’s political life .
A noteworthy series of initiatives to fight poverty was put in place a number of years ago , but it did not even fulfil the lowest of expectations , let alone produce the results that one would have wished to see .
We must do and achieve more and , above all , better .     . – I too was moved by the interventions by the President-in-Office of the Council and by the Commissioner , who referred to an incident that must have taken place during the Second World War .
Europe in particular must continue to play a leading role in this field and must extend that role to other aspects of disarmament .
We owe that to the thousands of communities whose development has been undermined by these and other weapons that kill and mutilate at random .
I should like to begin by commending Mr Kirkhope on his efforts to defend Parliament’s prerogatives .
As regards the second agreement , Switzerland will have to accept , implement and apply the current and future Dublin/Eurodac acquis with no exception .
They are extremely concerned at this state of affairs , and indeed the government and other authorities have expressed similar concerns .
We are playing a part in jeopardising the survival of key forests and biodiversity ; we are having a direct influence on the climatic conditions , the people and the employment situation in both the producing countries and the importing countries ; and , in so doing , we are damaging the businesses that act legally and destabilising international wood markets .
The political will must be there if we are to put a stop to this illegal trade , which facilitates corruption and money laundering .
The EU needs to reconsider its approach to talks on international trade agreements , so as to increase pressure to strengthen corporate social responsibility and to encourage strict compliance with International Labour Organisation rules and conventions , and international conventions on the environment and human rights .
This is a key sector for the EU with huge potential , a sector that is capable of helping to turn economic and social cohesion into reality .
I should like to add a few additional points .
They are therefore the main culprits for the terrible situation of thousands of businesses and for the destruction of thousands of jobs , with devastating social consequences .
It is about ensuring that international trade in this sector can take place on the basis of justice and fair play .
In this respect , there are , from our point of view , two components that should be brought to the fore : the trade component and the industry component .
The Commission ’s proposal concerning the Financial Instrument for the Environment ( LIFE + ) falls short of what is required , in terms of financial resources , and it is unacceptable that it fails to cover the Natura 2000 component .
It is our responsibility
