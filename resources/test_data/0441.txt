work that some of our fellow Members have been doing for a long time with regard to Ethiopia and in particular that of our friend and colleague Ana Gomes , not just because of the mission that took place , but because over all these years she has been condemning the situation in Ethiopia and taking it extremely seriously .
This is not a single measure but rather part of a long process - which began in 2004 - which is now taking the form of increasingly interesting and effective measures .
We hope that , with the proposal that will be put to the vote tomorrow , we will be able to continue moving forward and that with both what Parliament is proposing - and I am grateful for the great work by Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert and all of the honourable Members - and with what the Council is proposing , we will be able to achieve better protection of our critical European infrastructures . on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( ES ) Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mrs Wallis on the work that she has done .
I therefore believe that this work is only just beginning , as I said before .
We eagerly await the Commission 's studies on this subject and in particular an important element , which is the work with the people who are going to have to apply this Regulation : the judges themselves .
We are also grateful for your understanding in relation to integrating transport into the heart of the Lisbon Strategy .
From what I have heard , however , I very much share the view that , on the one hand , time is running out , but that , at the same time , we do not feel under pressure whereby if we do not take a decision today there will be violent conflict on Europe 's doorstep , which is what some would have us believe .
A Kosovo without economic viability , ruined and with 70 % unemployment will remain a tragedy for us all .
As we all know , the proposal was ultimately adopted , although many of the same factors that gave cause for concern more than a year ago have not gone away .
We should like to know if these strategy papers have benefited from other sources of funding , and if so how much of them will be funded by those sources .
Law is not soft , law is coercive .
Our concern in the Committee on Legal Affairs is , firstly , that we have no wish to hamper the Commission 's right of initiative , we have no wish to hamper the executive functions that must be carried out by the Commission , we have no wish to curtail the possibilities of development , but we do feel that it is important to establish a conceptual difference between the two types of instrument , and that when the Commission feels that it must avail itself of this kind of action , it ought to establish cooperation at least with Parliament , and certainly with the Council , so that preparations for such action do not give rise to misinterpretations or interference .
The open method of coordination , however , is not a legal method , it is not a legal instrument for producing general laws , and the two concepts cannot be confused .
Those plans must promote investment , innovation and research in all sectors relating to clean , low-emission energy sources .
The time for renewable energy sources has come , and only a boom in renewable energy , together with much greater energy efficiency , can help us cope with the climate change crisis and the energy supply crisis .
The debate on biofuels raises a moral issue and a question of principle : to eat or to drive ?
Brazil , as we all know , is a large and admirable country with enormous potential which is at a crucial point in its political and economic development .
We are also aware that the expectations of concluding an ambitious agreement between the European Union and Mercosur cannot go on forever , and if Mercosur itself does not make progress with its integration , and the European Union 's negotiations with Mercosur remain stagnated , with or without a Doha agreement , a decision would have to be taken on them , and once again the most important thing would be effectiveness : a bilateral agreement with Brazil .
If the European Commission really wants to establish the Institute , as we do , the negotiations will have to be restarted on the financial perspective and a real budget will have to be created , a large budget of more than EUR 2 billion , which is what is needed .
It is also important to facilitate the integration of these people in the host countries , thereby reducing mutual distrust .
I trust that at this time we cannot and must not abandon this aspiration . on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - ( ES ) Mr President , the Commission has defined three essential axes to exploit the potential of digital technology : online accessibility , digitisation of analogical collections and preservation and storage of digital contents , and we are well aware of this .
We are talking about learning disorders that affect a substantial segment of our population .
Academic success is a genuine possibility for them .
Therefore , despite this situation , the fact that we are discussing it today means that we wish to put an end to the invisibility , and so I have lent my support with full enthusiasm not only to the written declaration and the oral question , but to this debate .
