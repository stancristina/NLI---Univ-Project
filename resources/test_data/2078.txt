Thirdly , we need to give new impetus to the energy supply , that is to say produce more energy .
He is the MEP who has worked on this matter and who is most familiar of all with it , but he is unfortunately ill at home in Ireland and cannot participate in this debate .
It is fundamental to free movement in the EU to make it easier for people to move between different Member States and , at the same time , be able to collect various social benefits .
When we debated the matter in the committee , there was a large majority in favour of our approving the Council’s common position .
Since then , a change has taken place in relation to the original position , namely in connection with paragraph 2 , which has to do with the fact that , as early as during the discussion in the committee , we knew that there was disagreement between the Commission and the Council when it came to some specific benefits .
Otherwise , the rapporteur’s position is the same .
We know about there having been a parallel overhaul of the Regulation itself .
The two views I am now discussing , that is to say firstly that we must not delay the process and , secondly , that we have to a large extent had our opinions taken into consideration , mean that we should approve the common position , but with the amendment that has been tabled so as to avoid legal uncertainty .
It is in neither the Commission ’s , nor the Council’s nor Parliament’s interests , and it is definitely not in the interests of the people .     Mr President , over the years , the subordination of women , which we know exists in all areas of society , has been emphasised and debated on this day in particular .
Each year , we have pinned great hope on all the words being translated into practical action .
The significance and scope of equality issues in all political areas required a Commissioner for Equality concentrating exclusively on equality issues .
It is the cause of more ill health than malaria and road accidents combined .
The names for that experience are traffickingand prostitution , but it can also be called sexual slavery .
On the day that we have achieved these objectives , we shall hopefully be living in a society that does not need special women’s days .
Paid parental insurance is necessary if women are to be able to work and fathers of small children are to be able to share responsibility for family and home .
Certain Member States select a combination of high taxes , comprehensive public services and generous subsidies , while others go for low taxes and a more rudimentary welfare model .
The June List wants to see a proper review of the growing influence of EU rules within social and labour market policy .
When it comes to introducing measures such as the ‘minimum wage’ , we interpret this as referring to what , in Sweden , we call social allowances and not to the introduction of a minimum wage system .     Mr President , it was nice to hear someone from the Commission defend the Services Directive for once .
What we now see is every Commissioner appearing to have his or her own agenda on this issue , something that is extremely unfortunate .
Yet , this very day - 8 March , International Women’s Day - the Commission is removing the whole of the health sphere - that is to say , an area dominated by women - from the Services Directive .
What does the Commission intend to do about this ?
Will the Commission present a new proposal in the health area ?
It is not only a Services Directive that we need , but a directive that provides increased trade in services across European borders .
It is important to analyse the issue : how much will be left of the European services sector subsequent to the exemptions now being granted ?
How will the Commissioner guarantee that all European countries have competitive advantages through the country of origin principle and through a free and open trade in services ?
Do you share my view that it is not enough to grant exemptions through the Directive on the posting of workers ?
The third question I should like to put concerns services of general interest .
There are also complaints from the poorer part of the world about the EU’s and the United States’s agricultural policies on the grounds that we do not provide access to markets and are dumping prices on the world market .
With a view to modernising the EU’s institutions and to that implementation of sound administrative practices discussed by Commissioner Kallas , we must , however , also demand more from the tax revenue we invest .
My question concerns the way in which the Commission intends to work in order that the decisions taken by the EU institutions are also implemented and turned into a reality , reflected in improvements to people’s everyday lives .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I feel very much in two minds about the whole preference system as such .
Experience shows , moreover , that , as a policy , the preference system has , in very many ways , so far been of a symbolic nature .
If we do not do so , how can trade , and indeed the world , become freer ?
I personally should like to see the new preference system actually go further , with already low customs duties abolished , opportunities for enhancing the regions improved and the system further simplified .
In conclusion , I wish to repeat my hope that ,
