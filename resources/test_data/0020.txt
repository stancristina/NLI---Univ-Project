on my knee in your kilt in Hamburg in 1946 .
We so respected your father , " he said .
" He could have taken advantage of us but he did n't .
He did all he could fairly to share out scarce resources and restore our country . "
Father is in his 90s .
I am in my 60s , my children in their 30s , my grandchildren between 0 and 5 - four generations of a Scottish and a European family .
It is this European Union , this Parliament , that are our families ' guarantee that the peace and security for which my father has fought and worked in his lifetime will indeed continue for future generations - the solidarity of generations .
Madam President , the House kindly agreed on 16 November to a request from the committee which I have the honour to chair to delay the final vote on Mr Cashman 's proposed legislative resolution .
That delay was intended to allow time for the other institutions to consider our amendments and for the Commission to formulate amended proposals .
Since our November part-session , we have had contacts with the other institutions , though as yet no agreement has been forthcoming .
Therefore , we would ask the House for a prorogation of the delay of a maximum of two months in order to conclude the dialogue and , we hope , present to you compromise amendments for voting at our part-session on 28 February .
( Parliament approved the request )
Agenda Madam President , on a point of order .
I wish to draw the attention of the House to an unfortunate incident which has occurred since our last part-session , and that is the case of Mr Panikos Tsiakourmas .
Many of you may be unaware that part of Cyprus is already part of the European Union because Great Britain retained sovereign bases on Cyprus and Mr Tsiakourmas was seized from one of those bases shortly before Christmas .
That seizure was an illegal act .
Mr Tsiakourmas is now being held in North Cyprus .
I would appeal to the House to express its sympathy with Mr Tsiakourmas and his family .
He has been accused of a crime of which I do not think he is guilty .
However , whatever the merits of his case , the circumstances of his abduction were unacceptable .
He was abducted from the territory of a European Union Member State .
I would ask the President to express our concern to the Ankara Government about this incident and our hope that this unfortunate incident will not affect the solution to the Cyprus problem and the peace negotiations which are continuing at this moment , and to express our hope that Mr Tsiakourmas will be released as soon as possible .
Madam President , has it been brought to your attention that the Members ' register of interests was last week published on an Internet site , www.mpt2001.co.uk ?
This was not the result of Parliament putting into practice the principles of transparency and openness , but follows the copying of the records by a team in Parliament working for a British television comedian .
Now that the records have been put into the public domain , will you advise all concerned not to allow Parliament to continue looking secretive and foolish , but to take speedy action to bring us into the twenty-first century and get the information published on our own website and made permanently available to European citizens ?
Madam President , I also regret that a British comedy programme sought to make light of Parliament and would point out that my own group has , of course , already published its register of interests on the Internet .
It remains open to Mr Davies ' group to follow suit and follow our lead in putting the register of interests on the Internet .
In the meantime , I agree with him .
I think the sooner this is on the Internet , the better .
It is a matter of public record .
There is no reason why it should be kept secret .
That is the point I believe the Quaestors will be urging on the Bureau in the near future .
Credit institutions Mr President , the main points of controversy in this report concern three different types of contractual agreement , namely repo agreements , netting agreements , and contracts conducted on a regulated market .
As Mrs Peijs ' report outlined , these types of contracts were discussed in committee pending this debate and , in essence , what we are seeking to do with the compromises proposed by Mrs Peijs is to ensure that parties can choose their own contract law in relation to these particular contracts , but not their own winding-up proceedings law .
There is a separation here between the law of the contract and the external insolvency law , because it is quite important to ensure that parties , though they may choose the law of contract , may not actually choose their own insolvency law .
Now a problem arises concerning the interaction between the law of contract and insolvency law .
What we are trying to do is to ensure that the contract operates and whatever proceeds are left at the other end are then dealt with according to the insolvency law of the home State .
There is still one slight uncertainty in the text about what happens with regimes , for example , in Spain which have insolvency proceedings which kick in before the contract law actually takes place .
In essence , these are known as automatic stays and mean that in certain countries , such as Spain , I believe all contracts are suspended automatically by an insolvency proceeding .
