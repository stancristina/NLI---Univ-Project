The competent agency judged that it should remain on the list and , consequently , I have no criticism to make of that .
The Council welcomes the resolution by the European Parliament of 10 April reinforcing the Union 's clear stand against these measures .
The Council will keep the situation under close review . '
It is also deeply concerned at the continuing repression of members of the opposition .
The ? U will continue to keep the situation under close review , especially as regards the possible exercise of legal recourse for the 78 persons convicted .
Who sent it ?
This is , in fact , what the American imperialists cannot forgive the Cuban revolution and they are striving to overturn it by every possible means , including assassinating its leaders .
What comments does he have on the fact that the conspiratorial meetings organised by the US representative in Havana are also attended by Greece 's diplomatic representative ?
Mr President , to start with , this is not a question to which I shall reply .
( interruption off the microphone by Mr Korakas ) Please do not interrupt... you are not worthy of a reply !
His government is also guilty and should reply with greater respect to the questions I put to him .
These items may be included in EU-USA relations : the Middle East and Iraq and recommendations by the High Representative , Mr Solana , on an overall strategy in the field of foreign policy and security , together with a wider strategy to deal with the spread of weapons of mass destruction .
The second report examines the efficiency of common financing resources available for the repatriation of immigrants and asylum seekers who have been rejected , for the management of external borders , for programmes in the field of asylum and immigration in third countries and for the application of the principle of the distribution of burdens .
As you know , there are countries which consider that these issues - relating to the integration of immigrants , in other words - are internal issues .
This issue concerns the Commission and , provided the Commission submits the study , of course we shall see how we can take it into account for Thessaloniki .
On the basis of these conclusions , the Council addressed this issue , as it did within the framework of the conclusions of the General Affairs and External Relations Council of 19 May , when it reiterated this paragraph and , especially , the need to examine the possible creation within the framework of the Union of an intergovernmental defence capabilities development and acquisition agency .
Efforts have been made to bring forward this idea .
Weapons of mass destruction , especially nuclear weapons and their non proliferation , are indeed an issue which is provoking a great deal of concern in the Union in connection with Iran .
The question , which concerns the opinions expressed on this issue by the Commission , should rightly be submitted directly to that institution .
These issues were raised at the round of negotiations for a trade and cooperation agreement between the Union and Iran held in Teheran on 1 and 2 June .
I have already stated in my reply - and I wonder why this is being asked a second time - that the Council will take account of the report to be submitted when it discusses issues relating to Iran at its next meeting .
The Council will take account of this report and will decide what it is going to do on the basis of it .
Consequently , the European Union is constantly urging neighbouring countries , including Iran , to demonstrate self-control and support efforts to stabilise Iraq .
The Council has identified the peace process in the Middle East as a basic field in which the Council wishes to achieve substantial progress through more intensive dialogue with Iran .
The Union will continue to raise these issues in its contacts with Iran .
However , the Union was present at the meeting held in Crete a few days ago , at the Euro-Mediterranean conference , which was also attended by the Israelis and the Palestinians and numerous other Arab countries .
The Union is encouraging Iran to sign , ratify and fully implement the relevant international acts , especially , as I said earlier , the agreements of the International Atomic Energy Agency , because at present the Iranian nuclear programme is causing concern in the international community , to which I also referred .
However , any indication of the possible existence of such a programme will be taken into serious account and examined with all due attention .
This is being done , among other things , through the broad EU/Iran dialogue on human rights set up last December .
Mr President , I would find the idea of Parliament 's passing such a resolution , proposing a change of regime in Iran and a referendum on the introduction of democracy , extremely interesting .
There are two essential categories of issues .
It could be much stronger , but it has a role and its opinion is necessary and respected .
In future , this procedure will certainly play an important role .
I believe , therefore , that with the discussion taking place in the Convention , it is very important for there to be an article covering the open cooperation procedure , determining the role of Parliament and , as the Commission has proposed , for there to be a special reference to the application of this procedure to social protection , where there are various problems , given that many of these competences in the social sector are national .
We must say here that , so far , there is experience concerning financing of the strategy for employment
