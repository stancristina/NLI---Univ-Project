the supplementary and amending budget the Council intends to set up three new directorates within its General Secretariat to implement the common European security and defence policy .
One ' s attention is drawn the urgency of the situation .
The structure of the organisation menacingly indicates that the same functions are to be discharged in the areas of both crisis prevention and civil crisis management in the Commission and the Council .
It is obvious that this will involve the creation of an entirely new Council activity , which will , in fact , have nothing to do with normal administrative expenditure .
For this reason the 'gentlemen' s agreement ' between Parliament and the Council , according to which they undertake not to interfere in each other ' s budgets , cannot be extended to these actions .
Finally , it should be noted that the margin for 'Administrative Expenditure ' in heading 5 is now only EUR 34 million .
Madam President , I will try and keep to the timetable .
Among the main challenges for the European Parliament are improved administration and increased efficiency .
This will make very special demands on the organisation and enhanced effectiveness of the translation and interpreting services .
There will also be totally new demands on general administration , which is why it is absolutely necessary to extend Activity Based Budgeting and Activity-Based Management to parliamentary administration also .
There must be an aim to rationalise the work of Parliament so that buildings expenditure can be cut .
It does not do the host country credit if the European Parliament in its territory has inconceivable difficulties trying to establish a rational building policy .
My remarks concern Mr Schleicher ' s report on the financing of European political parties .
For this reason I voted against donations by companies .
In any case I think that the excessive use of money has started to distort elections , an excellent example of which is the Italian elections .
Large countries were also given a new right of veto based on their population .
This misjudgement on the part of the leaders of small countries alone is sufficient grounds to reject the Treaty of Nice .
The Treaty of Nice supports a federal republic along the lines of the German model and does not recognise the demand of the French Prime Minister for a Europe of independent states .
This report supports the development of a federal state and must be rejected , and national parliaments should reject the Treaty of Nice .
Other countries do not dare to ask their citizens , who are the sole subjects of democracy .
It is thanks to your flexibility that we are now approving Parliament ' s opinion on the sixth Community environment action programme .
However , as we wanted to make our own contribution to the Gothenburg Summit , the first summit to be devoted to environmental issues , it has not been possible to avoid this rush , nor the Committee having to vote so late in the day .
During the preparatory work we achieved successful cooperation with the Commission , although opinions on the nature of the programme have not always been unanimous .
During the period spent preparing the environment action programme we have been able to reach reasonable unanimity on the areas of emphasis suggested by the Commission being the right ones .
Differences of opinion have been caused by the way problems requiring a decision have been addressed in the programme .
For example , preventing climate change will require a time perspective of decades .
How far the environment ministers get in reaching a united opinion in one week ' s time , remains to be seen .
In my view it is vital that the EU' s environment programme contain clear targets and timetables for achieving them because this is the only way of ensuring that the programme and its realisation can be evaluated sufficiently unambiguously .
The evaluation halfway through the programme must be based on verifiable progress on the basis of which we must be able to make the necessary corrections in order to achieve the targets .
Environmental issues must be included in all Community policies and decisions .
Therefore , these also require greater environmental expertise .
The Commission has proposed an interesting idea of creating new thematic strategies , thematic programmes for the problems causing the greatest concern .
Enlargement is both a challenge and an opportunity for the European environment .
The programme should present ways in which enlargement will become a major opportunity to improve our environment .
We must also ensure the major participation of citizens .
Mr President , I would like to thank all the Members who have taken part in the discussion .
I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs ; in my opinion the work was carried out well .
I also hope that the PPE-DE is able to support this report because I have taken their proposals very broadly into account in proceedings in the committee .
Possibly for this reason , this final proposal now coming for its first reading has become something of a mixture of combined hopes , but Bernd Lange and David Bowe gave a very clear idea of how we can work further on this programme document .
In that respect , this report and its preparation are in a class of their own .
Its most important objective is to improve the efficiency of administration , clarify personal responsibility and speed up the movement of funds .
This can only be achieved once both administrative and financial responsibility are clearly united under the same people as is now being done .
Renewing the Financial Regulation is essential to improving the efficiency of administration .
In this way the work of offices and bodies can be managed more on the basis of goals and results rather than on the basis of supervision and detailed instructions .
