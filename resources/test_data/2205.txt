No one is fooled by this small number of complaints , particularly not the human rights associations which are being overwhelmed by thousands of calls .
That apart , I congratulate Mrs Buitenweg and warmly welcome this report .
Football has become a sport of the masses and we must think about the safety of our children , our little brothers and the youngsters who frequent the stadiums .
Unfortunately , this statement , which is solely intended to give the authors a clear conscience , is completely false .
Secondly , it forces the Member State which is negligent in monitoring its borders to take responsibility for illegal immigrants who use it to get into neighbouring countries .
Secondly , in accordance with the precautionary principle , can Brussels continue to be a place of work for Parliament since it is not equipped with air purifiers ?
Madam President , before we take a vote - and I would rather a vote not be taken straight away - I should also like to join Mrs Theorin in appealing to Mr Duff as a friend and colleague to withdraw his request to establish the quorum .
- ( FR ) Once again we are confronted with one of the most sordid aspects of contemporary society : trafficking in human beings .
It would therefore be useful for us to start by solemnly reasserting that the dignity of all human beings is at stake here , and that any compromise with practices violating this is irresponsible and criminal .
I should like to pay tribute to his courage , but also to his clear-sightedness , because , even in his initial statements , he drew a clear distinction between his kidnappers and the Chechen people as a whole .
From this point of view , we must be pleased with Mr Maaten' s report and the amendments voted by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , which improve the proposed directive .
If the European Union sincerely believes that it can protect public health by covering cigarette packets with increasingly larger labels advertising the fact that " smoking kills " or " smoking causes cancer " , we are surely in the realm of the absurd .
Whatever the case , we are required to examine the content of the report before us .
We have labels on meat , wine , GM products , chocolate .
Well , it goes to show that slogans are not effective , just as a price increase would not be effective , as it would only increase smuggling and crime .
Our rapporteur is a Liberal and should not forget the lessons of laissez-faire Liberalism : let them live , let them be born , let them drink and let them smoke .
Employment levels in tobacco production , which formerly stood at 120 000 people , now involves no more than 60 000 people .
And , in comparison with the restrictions we are subject to in the context of mad cow disease , how is it possible that we are doing nothing about the 500 000 smoking-related deaths every year in Europe ?
Regarding the extension of this cooperation to the countries of the Mediterranean and to the countries of central and eastern Europe as well as to TACIS programme countries , I should like to inform Mrs McKenna that I do not entirely agree with her , and this is perhaps one of the few points with which I do actually disagree .
The McKenna report represents a move in the right direction , and we shall therefore vote in favour of it .
The proposed budget of EUR 7 million is , in our opinion , however , much too little to fulfil these objectives properly .
Incidentally , today , at a time when we are facing a significant stage of development , I think it important to stress that in all our policies we must find the necessary balance : between the Community approach and Community standards , on the one hand , and the specific national features and national disparities on the other hand ; balance between the need , in terms of production , to cover a large European market and promote European products , i .e . developing 'television without frontiers ' , and , on the other hand , the ability to retain options as regards wavelength standards and local television .
Firstly , on the subject of democratic access , people will tell me that other reports and other programmes , the one on "e-learning " for example , exist to support the efforts made by European countries to promote access to the Internet and to new technologies .
It is only a start , but let us not forget that we also have the task of building a cultural Europe .
I shall not therefore take part in any votes on the matter .
This time the necessary debates and the necessary action must not be postponed .
How does the Commission view this withdrawal and how does it intend to handle relations between Cuba and the Union in the light of the new situation ?
At the time , we were bound by the procedures legally adopted for the Third and Fourth Framework Programmes .
Lacking a legal basis , it is clearly not possible to assign a specific budget line for sport .
Ladies and gentlemen , you have to be aware that the Member States must agree unanimously in order to introduce even a protocol , and that this is even truer in the case of an amendment to the Treaty .
As you can see , it all hangs together .
You surely do not imagine that there are 91 projects cofinanced by the Commission without a single official to deal with them .
Otherwise , MEDIA PLUS focuses on the promotion and distribution of European films , particularly in cinemas .
The problem before us today
