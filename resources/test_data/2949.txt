the costs to businesses but also the costs to people’s health .
In the end , therefore , even impact assessments are political choices , and as a result I would ask you not to make them such a priority and so completely overstated compared with the other aspects of the law .
That is why we also think that the European citizenship concept must be tied closely to residence , with the explicit aim of encouraging inclusion .
There are still neo-fascist groups in Europe today , who feed on xenophobia , homophobia , Islamophobia and anti-Semitism .
Other concomitant measures are needed , however .
We in this House therefore have the opportunity – I would even say the duty – to make this Europe more transparent , more democratic , easier to understand and , hence , more acceptable .
Let us keep an active remembrance , in which the horrors that we Europeans have witnessed may serve as a warning for a different future .
The new agenda for 2007-2013 will in fact focus decisively on the role of cities .
I too would like to thank the negotiating team – composed entirely of men – and the team that participated in this difficult work – composed entirely of women from my group .
Israeli soldiers prevented excavations to let out the water ; the bombardment of northern Gaza has destroyed agricultural areas and killed civilians .
Let us not , however – as we have since 1980 – keep on repeating the line about two peoples and two states , while all the while bearing witness to what is , quite simply , the theft of Palestinian land .
The problem now consists in seeing whether the new Palestinian Government will be able to continue along this road in spite of Hamas ’ victory in the last legislative elections .
I would like to make just one point : the greatest contribution we could probably make to road safety would be to make less people use the roads .
What we have today is , in fact , a basic security financed through fares and extra ticket costs , and more or less cofinanced by the Member States according to the levels of security they wish to establish .
Finally , specific funding is necessary in order to monitor the cooperation measures .
The figures are quite clear : tied aid causes an average increase in the cost of goods and services of between 15 % and 30 % , rising to as much as 40 % for food aid .
However , the situation in Malta , although a far cry from that of Lampedusa in terms of the occupants ’ living conditions , does call to mind that Italian island in terms of its size and reception capacity .
I therefore urge the Council to adopt a clear and strong position so that , in line , of course , with the principle of solidarity , we arrive as quickly as possible at a common and fair immigration policy aimed at preventing the costs of these waves of illegal immigrants from burdening only the budgets of a few States on the periphery of southern Europe , which are totally unable to support themselves financially .     .
I will conclude by making three suggestions : - we should work towards consolidating Hamas ’ decision to call a truce , a decision that has also been confirmed ; - we should work towards developing , and devolving responsibility to , all of the actors involved in the Palestinian political framework , even with a change in the government in prospect , and propose to both of the negotiating parties that they acknowledge the agreements and the road map ; - we should work towards achieving a new chapter of mutual legitimisation with the prospect of a definitive solution in mind .
The Tul Karm crossing point is closed , and the issue is not just a humanitarian one , and it is not just a matter of the Palestinians inside Gaza starving : the problem is one of freedom and democracy .
They told us , the ones who went to Palestine , that we had not .
Let us try to understand what is happening in the Israeli Government : if a person such as Mr Liebermann , a racist and xenophobe , assumes power , what will we say ?
We must bear in mind that many things have changed in that continent .
Strengthening cooperation between the European Union and Latin America , by prioritising a two-way strategic partnership in political and institutional terms , with the aim of steering economic cooperation and socio-cultural integration between the two continents more effectively , are objectives that the party that I represent and also the common sense of the citizens and governments generally can only share .
I am honoured to have reopened the debate with my question , on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and its coordinators .
That does not promote credibility and does not result in the European Parliament’s becoming genuinely autonomous or independent .
I said in that debate – and I repeat it today – that this is a fundamental issue that affects our rules and enhances the European Parliament and our role , especially our role .
The brake put on the convention or the difficulties that the convention faces in being adopted in Europe must not compromise the role vested in Parliament as a whole .
We also need to express our solidarity with the Italian minister , who was accompanying her own father , a former Dachau deportee now confined to a wheelchair , in the parade .
To that end , I have called on the Council in my report to start talks as soon as possible to conclude the draft interinstitutional agreement , which the Commission put forward at Parliament’s request
