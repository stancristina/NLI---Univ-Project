is essential to identify the appropriate means of correcting the serious delay that does exist as soon as possible .
The summit must determine whether the peace process is still valid for the Israeli government .
The terrorists can be isolated if the people see the peace making progress , see the benefits , see what the leaders , starting with Arafat and Rabin , have done in the interests of the people .
At the same time we firmly condemn the resurgence and advance of Islamic fundamentalist fanaticism which , whatever right there may be on its side , has no justification for carrying out indiscriminate attacks in which innocent civilians of all ages often perish .
To conclude , we think Shimon Peres ' remark , that winning a war - Israel has already won three - is something very different from defeating terrorism .
Mr President , I have an evening all to myself - or rather , all for commerce - and I think it deserves this special sitting devoted to the distribution system and the Commission 's Green Paper .
Precisely because of its responsibilities ( commerce , tourism , small and medium-sized businesses ) , DG XXIII needs to be strengthened , just as the sectors it deals with are being strengthened , to maintain increasingly continuous contact with the indispensable consultative structures which represent commerce - the Economic and Social Committee , the Commerce and Distribution Committee - and also to be in a position to expand its own number of participants in order to allow every state and every commercial formula to be represented in Europe in this highly important sector for the economic and social future .
With the Green Paper on commerce all the public and private institutions and the direct players in the market , large and small , were invited to take part in discussion to lead , within two years , to the completion of a final white paper .
Having said that , I believe it is clear that the Group of the European People 's Party is fully in agreement with the report by Mr Garosci , whom we thank for his dedication in producing a report which we fully support .
First , these policies should distinctly improve the operational context of the sector from the bureaucratic , regulatory and fiscal viewpoints .
And thanks to their work , we confidently await a fine White Paper on commerce by the end of 1998 .
As everyone knows , I am in favour of the European legal area , but I also believe that , without a fundamental charter of individual rights , extradition is of course one of the guarantees for individuals .
Now I think the serious position to take on the issue is to judge each measure on its merits .
Mr President , Mrs Thyssen has already illustrated the reasons why the Group of the European People 's Party fully supports Mr Torres Couto 's report and she has also stressed some important issues contained in the annual report of the European Observatory for small and medium-sized enterprises .
I think the importance of small and medium-sized and craft businesses in the European economy and in European society is now unanimously recognized so it is unnecessary to expand further on that issue .
Only small and medium-sized firms can realistically make a contribution to improving employment levels in Europe and it would make a mockery of the summit to concentrate on other sectors and overlook this one .
And the role of the Member States must not be forgotten , especially as regards the regulation of access to credit .
Finally , I think it would be helpful if I responded to something Mrs Roth said in her speech .
To achieve this , it is obvious that the European Union must put the maximum political , commercial and economic pressure on Turkey to withdraw its troops from the island , just as the Greek Cypriot community must mute its desire for revenge .
Hence , with the sole and important exception of the city of Tuzla , the result threatens to allow room only for the extremist nationalist parties .
Even more dangerous is the outbreak of violence presented as ethnic and religious in origin when it is clearly politically motivated , violence which threatens to destabilize the country permanently .
Madam President , of course terminology , concepts and accuracy of the texts we may adopt in this House are extremely important .
Let me explain myself : why do the British Labour , French Socialist , and Italian left MEPs , who claim in this European Parliament to be fiercely opposed to the production of anti-personnel mines , not act with conviction to persuade their government colleagues in England , France and Italy to pass a tiny little law in their respective parliaments , worded more or less like this : "production of anti-personnel mines by the British , French or Italian arms industry is prohibited ' ?
This may be part of the explanation , but it is largely linked to the BSE.
Animal starch was identified as the proven cause only a year later , but it was not until 1990 that its seriousness was recognized in Brussels .
Why not provide them with a programme that will help them to complete their studies ?
Bilateral relations between Europe and Canada have a history going back to the signing of the Treaties of Rome .
Maintaining the right balance is what binds together the democracies , together with the rule of law and more firmly based international relations .
Failure to achieve the right balance also has an impact on relations and cooperation and so if we now treat our transatlantic relationship with Canada in the same way as we treat our relationship with the United States , it will follow the same logic and they will reinforce each other
