I should like , if you will allow me , to make two basic comments .
( Parliament adopted the decision ) Proposal for a decision ( B5-0593/2000 ) , by the Conference of Presidents , setting up a temporary committee on the 'Echelon ' interception system ( Parliament adopted the decision ) Report ( A5-0175/2000 ) by Mr Lehne , on behalf of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 91/308/EEC of 10 June 1991 on prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering ( COM(1999 ) 352 - C5-0065/1999 - 1999/0152(COD ) ) Before the vote on Amendment No 26:Lehne ( PPE-DE ) .
Mr President , as we were at second reading , I was unable to register my opposition to the Swoboda and , more importantly , the Jarzembowski report .
- ( FR ) Rail transport today stands at the heart of the public service deregulation and liberalisation projects being implemented by the European Union .
Furthermore , absolute and compulsory liberalisation of the railway infrastructure might hamper the development of the Community railways as a result , for example , of the instability and uncertainty which it would introduce into a market which needs a high level of technical expertise and investment both for the railway undertakings and the local authorities .
- ( FR ) I welcome this initiative to simplify and clarify the directives on the general system for the recognition of professional qualifications .
The European Parliament proposed numerous other provisions at first reading , mainly seeking to extend the information requirements of the Member States .
Anyone not on the list of friends goes to press a week later and therefore appears not to be at the cutting edge , which is obviously very bad for them .
It has been established from and confirmed by numerous sources that this wholesale bugging of all telephone signals has had considerable economic and commercial repercussions , to the detriment of European companies such as Alcatel or Airbus , which have lost huge contracts to American multinationals privy to privileged information obtained fraudulently and illegally .
Luckily , we still have sovereign states in Europe to defend European interests , states with sovereign justice which can unilaterally open an investigation into the activities of this network , a leftover from the Cold War which has now been turned into an industrial spy tool at the expense of certain companies and certain Member States in the European Union .
You prefer to remain ineffectual against traffickers and the mafia rather than making people realise that there are plenty of other ways of making money which are criminal from a humane point of view , from the point of view of the general good , starting with companies that throw employees on to the street , condemning them to a life of poverty , in order to increase their share price and their shareholders ' wealth .
Money laundering as defined in the directive should no longer apply solely to the proceeds from drug trafficking , it should also apply to activities linked with organised crime , such as fraud , corruption and any other illegal activity which affects the financial interests of the European Communities .
As several French Socialist Members have claimed the right during the debate on the fight against money laundering to put certain countries in the hot seat , including mine , on the basis of an erroneous , approximate and aberrant appraisal of the practices of Luxembourg as a financial centre and the Luxembourg political powers , I am anxious to refute here in the House , and as vigorously as our Prime Minister and the chairmen of the finance , budget and legal committees of the Chamber of Deputies of the Grand Duchy have done , the allegations which the French Socialist Members have become guilty of during their so-called 'assault course ' against dirty money .
No French delegation from the European Parliament could possibly question the compromise which resulted from the difficult negotiations in March 1999 .
Luckily , some Member States , including France since 1996 , have taken unilateral initiatives and responsibility for designing national systems which have proven to be transparent , efficient and flexible and which should have been authenticated .
Not knowing how to cure this disease and not having had the will to prevent it when we could have done so from 1989 onwards , we are now reduced to bidding to reassure the consumer .
So , today , we are offered a compromise .
The intermediate solution lies between fork and pitchfork , i .e . at the frontier , the only place where animals can be protected against unreasonable transport and consumers can be protected .
But that does not mean that I shall relax my vigilance , nor does it mean that I shall stop asking questions ; as I have reminded several governments , I shall continue to monitor the application of additionality closely .
I admit that there is a weakness from the point of view of sanctions for those who do not comply with additionality .
I can do no more than demonstrate that I am keen to enter into dialogue and that I am available , in the case which you have pointed out to me and in every other case , to do so as actively as possible , while at the same time complying with the general regulation of the Structural Funds .
We think that Greece , which is now a full member of the Economic and Monetary Union , is more conscious of its administrative weaknesses and of the need to
