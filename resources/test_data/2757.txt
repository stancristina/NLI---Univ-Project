Such an unreserved statement is a clear proof that the political groups , at least the two major groups in this Assembly , are not divided in the fight for renewable energy , but that we are absolutely united in defending and encouraging it .
I myself had that experience with the Commissioners responsible for energy with whom I had contact , Mr Cardoso Cunha , Mr Matutes , Mr Oreja and now Mr Papoutsis , and I should like to thank them all for being so understanding .
So we are at the half-way point and it is appropriate to take stock .
Everyone knows what hopes the world places on the European Union for its pioneering role in encouraging democratic freedoms , the rights of women and equality of opportunity .
In that way we shall be pursuing a preventive policy whereas today , in medical terms , we are pursuing only a curative policy .
And it deals with questions genuinely concerning the real problems experienced by the SMEs , as is the case with the loans at below market rate interest - the loans provided by the European Investment Bank - or again the subject of security and the periods for recovery of payment for the services supplied by the small - and medium-sized businesses , which sometimes face excessive pressure from the great conglomerates , both commercial and managerial .
We did not agree beforehand , and we expressed our concern in the meetings of group chairmen or deputy chairmen that the formulas being used - whereby support in terms of staff or material would be permitted , though that support would have to be declared on the register and transparent - were very dangerous , notwithstanding the traditions of certain Member States in the regulation of this matter .
Secondly , we would have preferred to support the common position , had it incorporated our two amendments to Articles 4 and 5 , concerning respectively the separation of accounts in the management of airports and the user committee .
Madam President , I rise to speak as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment in connection with the Ford and Linzer reports .
There is a need for all citizens to be made aware of these effective measures .
We are opposed to that .
The Union must recognize the right of third-country nationals who are legally resident in the Community to travel within it under the same conditions as Community nationals .
Mr President , this statement and debate were motivated by the revelation of the existence of the now infamous internal Commission note - or , if you like , note by a Commission official - concerning the disinformation strategy to be pursued with regard to the issue of mad cow disease .
The scientific basis for lifting the ban on gelatine is unclear , and the Commission has not provided us with the information requested in paragraph 6 of Parliament 's resolution of last June .
In all future decisions , the slightest risk must be eliminated .
I am coming to an end , Mr President .
However , the solution must not lie solely in rectifying matters for the future .
The content of the note in question amounts to turning immorality into a commercial rule .
In the Iberian peninsula , for example , infrastructure deficiencies which we have been suffering since the nineteenth century will be made good .
It goes without saying that the enormous political and public relations cost of such a delay would be borne by Parliament , since our citizens would not understand why , having repeatedly stressed the need to build this network and insisted that it would lead to the creation of countless jobs , this House should now decide to reject the agreement reached or , in other words , to perpetuate the infrastructure deficiency , which in some Member States is very great , thereby delaying the creation of jobs .
Thirdly , we are all convinced that besides improving our competitiveness , the trans-European transport networks will help to strengthen the Community 's cohesion and rectify its obvious territorial imbalances , thereby facilitating the future enlargement of the Union to include other European countries .
Transport is an economic , social and political factor of the utmost importance , and not only is there a need for transport networks that are geared to realities , but those networks must function at a European level , with the interoperability that is necessary and only logical .
According to the Treaty , all policies are to contribute to the strengthening of economic and social cohesion .
Furthermore , they live in the poorest regions of the poorest Member States .
Mr President , in an opinion which was unanimously adopted , the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment declares itself in favour of the regulation of the activities of pressure or lobby groups , on the basis of the following points .
In this way , the activities of the lobby groups will be made subject to serious and responsible rules .
But that is not the main point .
The most recent restructuring operations should be carried out in the best possible social conditions , using the available financial resources and the ECSC reserves to finance not only R&D programmes , but also social measures , such as early retirement schemes and compensation for redundancy .
And , lest anyone should think that permissiveness with regard to dumping by third countries is somehow connected to internal competition in the Community steel industry , I would add that the steel sectors of some Member States will be harmed more than those of others .
The countries of northern Europe began the restructuring process before those in the south , because the former joined the European Community and benefited from the ECSC approach
