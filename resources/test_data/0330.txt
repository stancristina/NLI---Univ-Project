on matters such as the Oil Fund , to quote just one example .
Commissioner , I would finally appeal to you to get a firm grip on HELCOM - the Helsinki Commission for Baltic Marine Environment Protection .
This organisation can implement the regional way of tackling things that both Parliament and the Commission wish to see .
Mr President , I should like to thank my colleagues in both the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy and in the Council and the Commission for their fantastically creative and constructive cooperation .
We are voting , for the aforementioned reasons , in favour of Amendment No 41 , calling for the rejection of the Commission 's proposal in its entirety .
There would be a significant temptation to do this .
In practice , it is the dangerous system whereby political parties are to decide which political groups are to have the status of parties and so receive financial aid , a system unknown to the Swedish Parliament .
Through EU cooperation , the common work in favour of a cleaner Baltic Sea will be intensified .
The resolution emphasises a number of important areas for continued reinforced cooperation between the EU and the United States , but also areas about which there are different views .
In spite of this , I have not been able to support the resolution since paragraph 5 requires qualified majority voting in the Council of Ministers for foreign and security policy too .
Mr President , you were very quick in drawing up the work plan .
I should have liked to see a debate , but it would be good if we could take a decision on this issue in the course of this week .
It is therefore important that we bring about the simplification intended in the Commission 's proposal .
Nor are we convinced by the argument for raising the threshold values on the grounds that there are now so few cross-border tenders .
Amendment No 24 must therefore be rejected .
We have therefore again tabled an amendment to Article 53 that , at first reading , was supported by almost the whole of the Chamber .
The ELDR Group wants us , then , to make efforts in the direction of simplification and modernisation .
Commissioner Bolkenstein thought we could look forward to a happy ending to the long journey towards sound legislation when it came to public procurement .
We are all agreed that public procurement is a major economic factor in the EU , accounting for 14-16 % of gross national income .
It is odd that this has passed certain people in this Chamber by .
I heard Mr Lehne say that environment issues must be handled in their own terms and economic issues likewise , but that is to miss the whole point .
The Council 's common position contained incompatible elements and was unacceptable at least where Articles 53 and 55 were concerned .
They refer to matters such as the right to enter into framework agreements , of which they often make use , concerning intellectual services and building contracts .
It is said that public authorities are bureaucratic and inefficient .
The closest I can get to bringing about such an outcome is probably to support an amendment by Mr Manders of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , in which the Commission is called upon to reflect on the situation and reconsider whether the proposal does not create more problems than it solves .
Why , in a legal text , should a list be drawn up of which capricious considerations should , or should not , be taken into account ?
It would then be possible to find significantly more flexible solutions to these problems .
It is also important that the quality should be good .
It is also important that they should do so in a way that is environmentally correct .
It is also important for the procuring authority or administration to be able to cancel a contract if it no longer needs the goods or services in question .
An exaggerated ambition to look after the interests of the market must not take precedence over the needs of people .
It is an historic event , meaning that our divided Europe has come to an end .
You also listened constructively to Parliament 's points of view on the employment guidelines .
I regret the handling of one issue , namely sustainable development .
As Mrs Ber√®s said , this must now be followed up at the Intergovernmental Conference too , and Parliament must be involved in the ongoing handling of the issue so that the transparency that has now been achieved can be maintained .
We think there are good reasons for scepticism .
It is no coincidence that most GM crops cultivated around the world are resistant to a specific pesticide .
It is also on this basis that we shall vote .
I should also like to thank the rapporteur for the open way in which she has worked on these issues and which has given other groups the opportunity to exert some influence .
We also find it unacceptable that , during a transitional period , genetically modified organisms otherwise not in actual fact permitted in the EU should be permitted .
Clear rules on co-existence are required , and rules are also required concerning environmental liability in relation to genetically modified crops .
Only then do we think that a start can be made on the debate .
Our task is to embrace a more responsible position , both globally and in the European Union .
Mr President , I wish to begin by thanking both rapporteurs for the work they have done , but I have to say that I am very uneasy about the decision we have to take
