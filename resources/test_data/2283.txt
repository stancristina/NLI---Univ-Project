Total transparency and continuous monitoring are required with regard to the handling of that money .
Of course , our ultimate aim must be to close down the Chernobyl reactor , and I would like to remind you all that there was already a shelter , even before 1986 when the accident occurred .
So we are to remain ignorant of these political forces and , since we are paying - and , I repeat , quite rightly so - our ultimate aim must be to close down the reactor .
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this is not the first time that issues relating to the new EU-USA relations have been debated in Parliament .
Reservations have also been expressed by other Member States which , it is true , do not in principle disagree .
Nevertheless , the Agreement has serious weaknesses to the extent that its implementation is neither obligatory nor does it have a strong legal basis .
It is only natural for there to be fear and mistrust , since our partner on the other side of the Atlantic is burdened by a host of international violations , which show that it is no respecter of laws and international agreements .
While we have decided that , in each agreement concluded between the European Union and third countries , there will be clauses to ensure respect of human rights in accordance with European humanitarian values , I have the feeling that this is systematically passed over when it comes to our powerful partner on the other side of the Atlantic .
As a result , child deaths have risen to 12 million a year .
Therefore , in spite of all this , we will vote for the Agreement .
They are aware , however , that the people and the workers are not celebrating , and that they are not even applauding .
Unfortunately , the European Parliament is reserving this role for itself by adopting many of the proposals of the von Wogau report , a report which insists on placing stricter conditions on EMU than not only those of the European Commission but also those of the Treaty itself .
Mr President , I wish to say that the economic policy of 1998 has been sealed by the introduction of the euro and I think that the move towards the euro is pervaded by a broad conflict .
We are talking of stability agreements that will last ten years .
In this sense , there are blatant contradictions : in paragraph 40 we are for the reduction of working hours ; in paragraph 39 we are against ; in paragraph 25 we do not want a reduction in the wage of unskilled workers ; in paragraph 26 we do .
The reason for this is that both the directive and the recommendation operate within the framework of privatization , the most extreme liberalization , and free competition within an unregulated free market .
A private monopoly is incompatible with these three factors because it seeks profit and nothing else .
Mr President , I want to say that the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left agrees with Mrs Bloch von Blottnitz ' report too .
It is something which we , as a Parliament , must fight against and challenge , especially during the budget procedure .
I would like to put this question to the Commissioner , Mr Papoutsis : what could be done here - in the context of course of the difficult financial possibilities which exist ?
Petty pedantic speculation or issues of national egoism , such as the issue of the President of the Central Bank , should not obscure the true context of Economic and Monetary Union , the common vision of European integration , which must not of course be a reason for excluding and marginalizing some countries .
This criticism does of course not mean that entry into EMU should be free of conditions .
This must come about so that the people of Greece can share this day of hope and not feel disappointed at a time when the other peoples of Europe look forward with optimism to the announcement of their official participation in the euro .
The establishment of a common currency is a decisive step towards the strengthening of European integration .
They do not solve the problem of unemployment , of poverty , of marginalization .
Let the strong economy be placed at the service of the whole .
Let us bring about the dawn of a great new era for a social Europe , a great new hope , a great new inspiration for all its citizens .
It will not reduce by even one person the 25 million unemployed , nor the 50 million people who are starving .
You all say that what you voted for relates to the present and the future of Europe and of the peoples of Europe .
This is your victory .
Even if the Maastricht criteria did not really fulfil the aspirations of the peoples of Europe , a "no ' at this moment would mean the rejection of all the sacrifices made by the peoples of Europe in order to arrive at this momentous occasion .
However , the creation of the euro is already of historic importance .
It demonstrates the scope of European political will when it exists and when it is approached with consensus and determination .
With this evaluation , this hope and these demands , which are always the demands of the European , radical and ecological Left , I will vote "yes ' to the proposal that is being put to us for the launching of the euro .
A Europe without borders and without discrimination , a Europe of the people , of working people , of cooperation , of peace and democracy , remains
