Let me just add that , at the end of this year , a decision will have to be taken as to whether Turkey fulfils the Copenhagen criteria , which are decisive .
We , however , regard such structures as indispensable ; we need them in order to be able to ensure the proper and comprehensible distribution of EU funds for regional support or cohesion policy .
I take the view that Turkey should remain the candidate country that it already is .
However , this is of course , on the assumption that such Kurdish regions are not used as bases for military or terrorist attacks on Turkey .
It is something we will have to examine in the autumn , in exactly the same way , for example , as we will have to examine – as the German Foreign Minister has said – whether Turkey can be regarded as a safe third country for the purposes of the asylum procedure , as Germany accepts more asylum seekers from Turkey than from any other country .
I surely ought to know if Turkey were asking for more money ; it is not .
There will then be a solution , and so all the issues will no longer be relevant and will pass away .
I would also ask the Council to give this question very serious consideration , because , ultimately , Parliament’s consent will be needed .
It cannot be acceptable that the armed forces , the National Security Council , should have the upper hand when decisions are taken in Turkey .
What this report on Turkey now presents us with , though , is the opportunity to send an important political signal and to put the debate on a broader basis .
The Turks must bear in mind that the criteria cover not only the Cyprus issue , but also the question of whether the European Union is itself in a position to welcome their country into membership .
The closure of the Turkish-Armenian border has meant that the transport of goods to Armenia is more expensive , and this frustrates the European Union’s economic aid to that country .
We want a strong Turkey as a good partner , but we also want a stable European Union that is capable of action .
Commissioner Wallström , I must give my particular support to the approach to set up cost-benefit analyses .
The German Federal Chancellor had announced this conference at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg .
I will , however , make some observations by way of adding nuances .
After all , we have to finance renewable energies , and we all know that they do not come cheap .
I will be working here this evening on behalf of those whom I represent , and will be doing so until tomorrow lunchtime .
In so doing , he violated all the rules of honesty , trust and collegiality .
With this in mind , we are grateful to the Commission for its efforts , and have , as a group , expressed our opposition to an appeal to the Court of Justice not only in the course of the debate in the Committee on Citizens ’ Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs , but also in the resolution of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .     . – Thank you , Mr President ; ladies and gentlemen , it may perhaps be said that the earlier debates on Mrs Boogerd-Quaak’s reports on the freedom of the media and the exchange of airline passenger information have dramatically demonstrated how important it is to prepare for crises in good time , how difficult it actually can be to defend our Union’s core values when under great pressure and in crisis situations , and how important it is that we should arrive at common principles and procedures .
I will conclude by saying that I attach particular importance to the principle of openness .
Without such a procedure , the whole article remains a paper tiger .
Let me say , while we are on this subject , that I well recall the arbitrary treatment meted out to my own country , Austria , in relation to what we are talking about .
What is on the table is what has emerged from negotiations .
This is where I want to express my disagreement with what Commissioner Byrne had to say .
Whatever our differences about the details , then , I hope that they will receive the general support of the House .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in view of the short time available , I want to speak only on the Gebhardt report .
It plays the interests of consumers against those of the banks and in many cases it actually incites the one against the other , despite the fact that Europe needs more cooperation not recrimination , more seriousness instead of populist superficiality .
In all other respects , we believe this is a good report .
If they go away on holiday , discover on setting out that they have lost their card , and report it three weeks later , the cardholder’s liability will still be limited to EUR 150 .
There is competition in pipelines ; there already was when the monopolies existed .
I must say , however , that I and a few others , too , were then rather surprised at how quickly this follow-up proposal for a regulation concerning gas transmission networks has come .
The best form of security of supply is surely to have our own supplies , and we must therefore welcome the fact that work is gradually being done ( a ) to produce high-quality gas ourselves inside the European Union and ( b ) to feed that
