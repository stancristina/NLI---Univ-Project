therefore like to say by way of conclusion : let us not stand in the way of the Commission ' s reform process but support it instead .
Parliament works significantly faster .
How does the Commissioner intend to create unambiguous and legally secure positions for service providers ?
I will return to this in a moment , but on behalf of my staff , I would very quickly like to thank those Members of this House who have carried out the Commission ' s work .
The Commission is therefore of the opinion that the directive will stimulate European integration and will , consequently , lead to greater economic growth , more investments in innovation and more jobs in Europe .
It will also have a favourable effect on the European industry ' s competitive position within the global market and this aspect too has been stressed by a number of Members in this House .
This is , of course , true .
Parliament tabled a number of amendments at first reading which proved to make a positive contribution to the common position and which elucidated and reinforced the Commission ' s original proposal .
In this connection , the Commission will be happy to meet Parliament ' s request to issue guidelines for codes of conduct and to stimulate the establishment of effective procedures for notification and removal .
I would like to inform Mrs Plooij that the directive on copyright in the information society will be discussed during the forthcoming Internal Market Council , which will take place on 25 May .
Those restrictions also apply to selling via the Internet .
Well , it is an outstanding example of how topical and necessary food aid is , even today .
The European Union has codes of conduct which deviate from this and which it tries to apply to its own aid .
This can happen very easily , both in buying products and selling food aid within the local market , because speculations and price rises are just round the corner .
In fact , it promotes exactly the opposite of what is really needed , namely a strategy which leads to self-sufficiency .
Does the Commission think that this is feasible and could aid not be allocated via one development budget line ?
Also the fact that the amounts spent are disproportionate to the number of displaced persons raises questions .
Mr President , it seems simple .
None of this detracts from the fact that the recipient countries sometimes have dire situations to contend with .
Ever since its conception in 1991 , it has been faced with intransigent separatism from the Dnestr Republic .
Given the level of exchange rate stability and internal currency stability achieved by Moldova , I can go along with this .
Therefore , we are pleased that several groups have given their support to Amendment No 8 , which states that possession will have a deterrent and preventive effect on the consumer .
The consequences in economic terms are certainly not to be underestimated .
It hampers economic growth and endangers public health and safety .
Mr President , the European Commission ' s Green Paper and Mrs Fourtou ' s report have confronted us with a problem that we are quick to underestimate .
The single market is now an unqualified success and there is no reason to impede the smooth functioning of the single market .
The Commission does agree , however , that we must step up and improve the fight against counterfeiting and piracy , although it takes the view that there are other ways of achieving this goal rather than through the reintroduction of controls at the internal borders .
It is also important from the point of view of public health and safety .
In addition , I am planning to draft a communication , pursuant to the Green Paper , which will require the Commission ' s approval in the very near future .
Mr Manders and also Mr De Clercq , and likewise Mr Inglewood , have spoken of the need to harmonise certain measures of a legislative nature and that is important of course .
Today , the question of parallel imports and especially the question of exhaustion of trademark rights is under discussion as a separate issue within the Council and Parliament .
Afterwards , and in the light of our experiences , let us see to what extent it is necessary to uphold and strengthen these measures .
As Mr Laschet has made very clear , so far the EU contribution to the financing of these bodies has been made under the common foreign and security policy .
That is what I call a conflict of interests .
However , I take the view that there is no possibility of providing truly effective protection of intellectual property rights if the purchase of counterfeit products is allowed to go unpunished .
This is only right and proper to my mind .
On behalf of the 31 delegates , I would also like to thank the Commission which immediately expressed sympathy in the form of a letter from Mr Prodi to the municipality of Enschede .
That problem has been addressed by this Parliament ' s Bureau and , if I understand it correctly , the Bureau issued an opinion to the Conference of Presidents with a proposal not to hold any votes this coming Friday .
I would not want to term it misuse because then I would not know what else these Rules could be used for .
The third possibility is to hold debates on Fridays without voting and then delay the votes until Brussels or subsequent sittings .
I wanted to highlight these two aspects .
The Dutch group which made Fridays a subject for discussion in this way did not do this because they are against Strasbourg or anything like that .
