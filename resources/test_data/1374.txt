I certainly do not take the view that Europe 's scope for taking action should be hampered by imposing a tax on speculation , as the Greens have once again proposed today : this would be tantamount to double taxation , since profits from such financial transactions will in any case be taxed as profit by the domestic financial institutions .
I therefore believe that we are quite right to call on the Commission to carry out further studies in this area .
Furthermore , if economic and social cohesion is to make progress , we shall have to define more clearly and realistically than in the past what we mean by cohesion and the adaptation of living standards in the Union .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the long-term goal must inevitably be for all Member States to take part in monetary union , and in that respect there is no conflict with the goals of greater economic and social cohesion .
EMU, with all its advantages - including in particular for social and economic cohesion - is impossible without nominal convergence .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this report is important in that it spells out the danger that the principle of economic and social cohesion might be abandoned in the context of economic and monetary union .
To my mind , the statement by the leader of the authority responsible that the lesser of two evils had been chosen , because if the rightwing extremists had been refused permission to march there might have been riots on a larger scale , is in no sense an adequate justification .
Mr President , I can only endorse Mrs d'Ancona 's request .
She was sentenced to 20 years ' imprisonment by a military court in 1993 .
Above and beyond people 's important , everyday need for freedom , employment and a decent standard of living , one of mankind 's prime concerns is to live in safety , especially given the danger of the nuclear threat , which has no respect for national borders .
In future , in fact , the disadvantaged regions will be even more disadvantaged .
I trust the honourable Members will excuse my German .
Progress in achieving the targets set for the reduction of budgetary deficits is reviewed twice a year , so that it is possible to lift a suspension of aid within the year .
A crucial reason for the concentration of cultivation in developing countries is the dire poverty of the people in those regions .
The Commission proposes that initiatives could be funded under the UNDCP programme in particular , for example aid to monitor and combat the drugs trade .
I wish to state emphatically on behalf of the committee , and also on behalf of the members of the Committee on Budgets , that in our view , this is an impertinence .
Parliament has been demanding investigations for years now , but the Commission does nothing .
I find this unacceptable .
These are problems whose importance cannot be too highly estimated , namely the TACIS regulation concerning the States of the former Soviet Union and Mongolia .
Therefore this report has been deliberately arranged along regionalistic lines .
However , I should just like to say one thing : the man is , after all , a Turk .
Madam President , the Group of the European People 's Party welcomes the fact that we have now , as the previous speaker mentioned , finally achieved this cooperation agreement with Nepal .
Madam President , we too support this agreement with the Himalayan State of Nepal which , as explained in this report , is faced with two major infrastructure problems , namely the problem of electricity supplies and the problem of drinking-water supplies .
This cooperation will make it clear , without any possibility of a misunderstanding , to all these people , whether Hindus or Buddhists , who are now really living together peacefully , in contrast to many other countries , that we are ready to provide not only qualitative help but also self-help .
However , in 1995 the amount produced was 940 tonnes , which fell well short of the maximum permitted quantity of 1 million tonnes .
You know that the set-aside scheme was originally introduced by the Commission , amongst other things as an environmental element .
Nowadays , economic growth alone is not sufficient to reduce unemployment .
Mr President , I should also like to lay claim to the extra minute that was allowed to the speaker on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists .
Can an employment policy be implemented without funding ?
Commissioner , you have spoken again about solidarity , and I agree with you .
These people were quite young , and I should like to ask you now , Commissioner , whether it would not be advisable to produce a study on the transmissibility of the disease to human beings and indeed to have some data collected for the whole of Europe to establish where this disease is occurring .
I am still not quite clear why there should be any great difference between that and the labelling of fruit and vegetables .
If it is true that Zaire is involved in the conflict and if it is involved in the escalation , then I believe it ought also to take its share of responsibility for helping to end the conflict .
Nevertheless , the armed forces are still engaged in the same activities as they were pursuing last autumn .
It is important to bear in mind that the concept under discussion is not the deregulation of labour markets but only that of making labour markets more flexible in order to create more jobs and to make European industry and the European
