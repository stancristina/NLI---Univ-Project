The aim of the Commission ’s proposal is to increase protection for consumers .
For all of these reasons , I voted in favour .     .
There is , therefore , no apparent reason to encourage granting credit to cross-border trade , particularly with fallacious arguments that this will be the ‘engine ’ to ‘stimulate internal consumption in Europe ’ or a ‘key factor in the much-hoped-for economic resurgence’ .
On the other hand , complete harmonisation would weaken the rules applied by individual Member States , who must , therefore , retain the right to offer a higher level of protection to their consumers , even those States that feel that total harmonisation may prove useful in certain areas .
We welcome those rules that are intended to strengthen transparency and comparability .
In this regard , in fact , I cannot agree with the report .
Accordingly , the intention is , once again , to harmonise the internal market , by establishing Community legislation in the area of unfair business practice .
I welcome the rapporteur’s amendments to the Commission ’s initial proposal , which have made significant improvements to the proposal .
The proposal before us is intended to consolidate and harmonise existing legislation on pesticides and to standardise the rules across all Member States .
The purpose of the proposal is to simplify existing legislation and to define the roles of the various parties involved , in particular that of the European Food Safety Authority ( EFSA ) and that of the Commission , in setting MRLs .
In light of the need to guarantee a high level of food safety and given that I endorse the move to define roles and responsibilities more clearly , I voted in favour .     .
It is precisely these measures , however , that Parliament and then the Council removed from the initial proposal , because they considered them to be fundamentally unsuitable .
The gas and electricity markets have , to a large extent , been liberalised but remain essentially national markets .
I voted in favour of this proposal for a directive because I believe that the ecological design of energy-using products should be encouraged and I therefore believe that Parliament must support the Commission in its Integrated Product Policy ( IPP ) .
On 18 March 2003 , the Council adopted a common position on a Directive establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading .
This is one of the reasons why the Commission decided to opt for the collection of all batteries , so as to ensure that the valuable material contained in all batteries could be recycled .
I thus abstained from the final overall vote , because I believe that the outcome of the various votes will not ensure the required balance .     .
We are now looking at developing the first phase of the European Refugee Fund ( ERF I ) , which started on 1 January 2000 and will expire on 31 December 2004 .
This communication is the outcome of a consultation process involving various special interest groups , which will furthermore take account of studies currently underway .
I agree with the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market when it recommends that the potential Interinstitutional Agreement on Article 7 of the EU Treaty should only be addressed , if at all , after the accession of the new Member States .
Agenda 2000 maintained the ceiling for own resources and for funds , when enlargement to encompass a further six countries was already on the horizon .
This situation really needs to be changed , the ceiling on own resources must be increased and a response must be given to the serious problems of cohesion , poverty and of protecting greater economic and social cohesion between all the countries of the European Union .     Mr President , I wish to use the short time available to me to express my surprise and dismay at the lack of interest and the contempt shown in the debates in this Parliament to the harsh reality that , in a Union of twenty-five States , cohesion policy will lose its character .
It does , however , deem 0.41 % to be an acceptable minimum level for the allocation .
We insist that the ‘statistical effect ’ should be extended to the Cohesion Fund .     Commissioner , I wish to ask , what is your assessment of the integration of the Iberian electricity market , given that it has recently experienced some setbacks and that the agreement entering into force will only be provisional ?
We are entering a new phase and the Commission must have an industrial policy and protect its industry , without indulging in protectionism .     Mr President , I wish to start by providing some background to this case .
Is the Commission or is it not willing to adopt measures , specifically under its transport policy , which will not only save this sector , but also stimulate its development ?
The Eurostat issue is by no means over and done with and we clearly still have a great deal to see , learn and do about this matter .
I was under the impression that my request had been accepted but to date I have still not heard this opinion .
These are all matters which I am not in a position to discuss for one simple reason : they do not fall within the sphere of Parliament’s competence and I would therefore ask that this report be deemed inadmissible or referred back to the Commission until a legal study in the true sense of the word is submitted on these issues , which are serious ones .     Mr President , with tomorrow’s voting procedure decided , it is unclear to me whether or not it will be possible
