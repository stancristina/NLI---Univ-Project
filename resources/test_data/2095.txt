As far as grants are concerned , we call upon the Member States to abolish the practice of territorial grants and , instead , to support the transfer of a young person who decides to undergo a period of training in another Member State .
Mrs Todini , in her motion for a resolution , might have been more forceful in criticizing the inactivity of the Commission with regard to the comparative elaboration of professional qualifications on which all mobility hypotheses are based .
I think this is a good report which addresses some very important problems about which much has been said this evening : qualifications , diplomas , foreign languages .
Mr President , I should first like to thank Honourable Members , and especially the Commissioner , for having shown such detailed understanding of the fundamental aspects of this report .
Had the Green Paper been referred to that Committee rather earlier , perhaps things would not be quite so last-minute .
The question of defence will therefore have to be dealt with as soon as possible , by convening a conference similar to that held in Messina in 1955 with a view to defining the gradual merging of the Western European Union into the European Union in the context of a common defence policy .
In particular , I am not happy that this version has become somewhat illusory in mingling a whole series of issues such as organized crime , prostitution , the economic crisis and racism .
Preventing conflicts and finding peaceful solutions to them - peace keeping and peace making - cannot be just a rhetorical exercise .
Nor does it seem to me that the admittedly numerous and wordy amendments can restore its original force and substance .
What we do need is a clear , authoritative common foreign and security policy , and the will to provide it with all the necessary instruments that will make the European Union not just a market , which it is , not just a gigantic central bank , which for better or worse it is going to be , but an international political entity of the first magnitude with greater and greater autonomy .
We would do well to create security structures in the Mediterranean basin which supplement the existing Euro-Mediterranean agreements , improving the economic and social conditions and , in particular , controlling the immigration flows and the trade in armaments .
I would like to call upon all Honourable Members - and every persuasion is represented here , from one extreme to the other - to consider that we shall only achieve real maturity when we stop debating whether or not we should have a foreign policy , a security policy or a defence policy , and get down to the serious business of debating what that Union foreign policy should be .
I believe that the criterion of a fair return on industrial investment in common European programmes should not be completely abandoned but should be integrated and quantified over broader time frames and planning scales .
Our view of Mr Cohn-Bendit 's report is generally favourable , though we cannot agree with everything in it .
Mr President , I should like to tell Mr Cohn-Bendit that I agree with him , and that my group will be voting in favour of his report , which we regard as positive and , unlike on other occasions , full of ideas for positive action .
One reason why this is urgently necessary is that , as we all know , the Union 's humanitarian presence is enormous - indeed , we are the major contributor - but at the same time there is a confused presence of international bodies in Bosnia , as in other countries as well , and this is certainly no help to us .
I believe that the machinery for credible joint action is important , and this brings us back to the problem of the CFSP.
To be frank , I was hoping for some kind of explanation , some kind of justification , perhaps even some kind of argument that would help us to find the right way round this impasse .
They are trying to deprive Community producers of any possibility of staying in the game , least of all on equal terms .
We - Parliament and the European Union - have a duty to say that any commercial argument must take second place to a specific and irrevocable commitment to the producers , especially producers in a minority situation , as I have pointed out .
Not only did the panel fail to take into account the interests of the European Union but more particularly - and much more importantly - it completely failed to listen to the producers , especially the small producers , representing the ACP states .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , at the moment the progress of the negotiations and military action which will decide where power lies in Zaire in the future is partially obscuring the human drama which continues to be played out virtually all over the country .
But apart from that , I frankly do not have much to tell you about Kivu and so on , because we have not been able to get access to that region .
You know what happened in the Kisangani region .
In addition , the humanitarian agencies and the HCR in particular have been accused of inefficiency , indeed worse - we were blamed for the massacres and accused of killing the refugees .
In fact this is the first time that a deadline has been imposed for ensuring the repatriation of the refugees , because if any logistic operation is forbidden after a certain deadline , then everything gets more complicated .
I am not going to waste my
