for regions , nations and members of the public to be directly involved .
We did not wage a war to have a situation today that is not wholly dissimilar to the unpleasant state of affairs that we have seen there over the last ten years .
We have seen that the European Union has only ever carried out projects successfully when it has first had a plan setting out clear tasks and deadlines .
I should simply like to remind you once more that we know from numerous studies and surveys that a majority of European consumers want to know when foods contain genetically modified ingredients .
The same applies to the decision that this regulation should not include provisions on seed .
I am sure that at the moment no manufacturer will dare to bank on genetic engineering .
There already is .
Whether it is 0.5 % or 0.9 % I really do not care .
When it comes to drawing up guidelines - and I can tell the Commission that I am agog to see what will happen when they do - there will be a lot of hard work to be done ; it will not be easy , and I hope it does not turn out to be a bureaucratic monster .
No doubt it was too late for that .
Mr President , although a lot has been said in today 's debate about threshold values , and about their being politically arbitrary , I would like to emphasise how important it was for this House , at first reading , to specify a figure of 0.5 % , even though many were not happy about it .
Labelling has now arrived , so that consumers can make known their feelings - whether for or against - about this type of food .
Do you not also think that the safest and best way of providing patients quickly with better medicines would , in principle , be a fast and simple central procedure , and that it would be better if the Commission and the Member States were to hand out more money for research projects and at last get round to submitting the new legislation on children 's medicines to Parliament ?
We are , however , prepared to set such a quota , and it stands to reason that , when this is done , it will be possible to specify how much of this quota is to be fished by Portuguese and Spanish fishermen respectively .
This also resulted in profound changes to the food industry , with complicated processing methods and new ingredients giving rise to finished and half-finished products capable of being prepared quickly and simply , but with ignorance about them breeding uncertainty .
The first point to be made here is that substances in connection with which a study has been notified to the Commission are provisionally exempted from being indicated on labels .
The crucial difference from conventional additives is that processing aids are removed after use , and things that are not present in wine or beer do not have to be declared on the list of ingredients .
This is where there could well be a reduction in the amount of information provided .
Where these are concerned we have stressed the need for this great pot to safeguard the interests , futures and chances of survival of the small firms , scattered throughout Europe , working in the ceramics sector and producing highly-prized packaging such as that for Meaux mustard and similar goods .
This morning , I was at a big event in Frankfurt , along with several hundred others .
Amendment No 4 has to do with packaging materials in small quantities , which are therefore subject to a very low market penetration in the Member States .
All the Member States must make the utmost effort ; even today , we can already see that some of them are having problems with this 'trend-line ' . On that , Commissioner , I am again in agreement with you .
This is where , as a principle , climate protection must , without doubt , be given priority over factory closures and the transfer of production .
As I said , the Commission and the Member States now carry a heavy responsibility for implementation because the compromise is not as precise as Jorge Moreira and Parliament as a whole would have liked , but was watered down somewhat by the Council .
Today it costs EUR 5 to EUR 6 a tonne .
Now a brief word on the various areas of expenditure that will be the subject of the trilogue and which Mr Mulder raised .
It is in all our interests , and especially of course in the interests of the new Member States , that the work is done and that it is done well .
So far , however , the Council has not given the green light for the use of the flexibility instrument .
In view of the current debates - in Poland in particular , where ministers have resigned because they are evidently missing the opportunity to actually create the structures there that will allow the money to be used properly - I believe that all states must understand that no money can flow if the relevant structures are not in place .
The N+2 rule was introduced by us all and there was a point to it .
No Parliament of the Member States is kept informed like this .
This has in fact to do with the work involved in bringing in the new Financial Regulation .
I hope we will find agreement on that , too , because it is essential that aid be provided really quickly here .
The European Union supports the UN special representative and welcomes the initiatives of the UN Security Council , in particular Resolution 1460 of 30 January 2003
