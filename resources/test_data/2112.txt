either the spirit or the letter of any international convention whatsoever .
The food crisis in southern Africa was discussed at the most recent Council meeting on 22 July of this year , that is to say the meeting of foreign ministers .
The Council is disturbed by various political decisions and initiatives that have been taken and that have apparently contributed to exacerbating an already alarming humanitarian situation , involving drought and floods .
Regional efforts to solve the crisis should be encouraged in line with principles , such as that of good governance , laid down in the initiative concerning the New Partnership for African Development , NEPAD , in which the states of southern Africa play a crucial role .
Organisations forming part of civil society ought to play a decisive role in the distribution of food aid so as to prevent such aid being misused for political ends .
There is , however , a need for further efforts .
I surely do not need to say anything about Zimbabwe and Mr Mugabe .
It is surely self-evident what the Council thinks about the matter .
I should like to emphasise that the European Union is involved , but that it is the UN that takes action .
The EU is involved , then , but it is the UN that is responsible for actually carrying out the work .
The honourable Member is undoubtedly aware that the discussions in the Education and Youth Council on 30 May , discussions concerning the participation of young people , took place in connection with the adoption of a resolution on the framework for European cooperation in the youth field .
The Commission has drawn up proposals on this in a white paper entitled ' A New Impetus for European Youth ' .
Information and participation are some of the subjects which will be tackled initially .
The questionnaire has now been submitted to the Member States , which should answer the questionnaire with due regard for prevailing opinion among young people themselves , youth organisations and other relevant bodies .
The issues concerning young people 's voluntary work and greater understanding and knowledge of young people will be tackled at a later date .
I would like to emphasise on the Council 's behalf that the new framework for European cooperation in the youth field is still at a preliminary stage .
On the one hand , we have a group of young people who are more internationally minded than ever before and who are deeply committed .
I also want to mention the youth convention as exemplifying these very committed young people .
They are perhaps not opposed to European cooperation , but it does not interest them .
As for this small group , I would say that one of the gratifying features of the meeting in Elsinore at the weekend was that there were twice as many police officers as demonstrators present .
I can only declare myself in agreement with the honourable Member .
The Council is very aware of this issue , and I think this has been stated so well that I do not need to repeat it .
At a time when the Union 's activities are characterised by increasing development and differentiation , and immediately before major enlargement to include a number of new Member States , the European Council has found it necessary to strengthen the Council 's powers as a provider of guidelines and impetus .
The Council cannot see that these practical guidelines are in any way incompatible with the Commission 's executive powers , which cannot in any way be affected by a decision , the sole purpose of which is to enable the European Council to exercise as effectively as possible the responsibility which the European Council has been given .
As regards any possible democratic deficit and the lack of separation of powers within the Union , the Council considers that the current situation , regardless of what one thinks about it , cannot be affected by a reform the sole purpose of which is , as has already been observed , to implement the existing provisions of the Treaty more effectively .
Of course , the Council is not unaware of this classic problem , which is indirectly taken up in the Laeken declaration , for example , adopted by the European Council in December , and which will , in all probability , also be taken up in the Convention and later at the subsequent intergovernmental conference .
I hope that , with this explanation , I have made it clear why I cannot go further into the question which has been raised .
I will confine myself to saying that I am as exercised by Montesquieu 's theories on the separation of powers as the honourable Member is .
I am , as it happens , a political scientist by training and think that it is absolutely fundamental that we should keep this separation of powers in mind .
I said this as recently as yesterday , when I represented the Presidency in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs here in Parliament .
As a matter of form , I would like to report what I said on behalf of the Danish Government in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs yesterday , that is that the Danish Government is an ardent adherent of the Community method and does not want the Council to take powers from the Commission .
The Council is well aware that no breakthrough has yet been made in the talks , and that disappointingly little progress has so far been made , which has also been stated by the UN Security Council according to the report which Mr de Soto , the UN Special Envoy for Cyprus , issued on 9 July .
