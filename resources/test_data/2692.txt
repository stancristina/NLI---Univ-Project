is the whole situation .
I would like to put to them the following two questions : Firstly , what further steps can the Commission take , together with the Member States , to move towards an embargo on oil from Nigeria ?
But it is because Croatia has avowed allegiance to the European ideal , and seeks a rapprochement with us - or at least that is what is being declared - that the European Parliament must be strict in its dealings and must apply certain criteria .
We call upon our colleagues in that Parliament to make improvements by introducing amendments to the legislative process .
But the course which you are adopting is now just the reverse .
These persons were arrested in Ethiopia and then extradited to Djibouti , where they have been taken into custody .
The European Union should be one of the main institutions involved in providing effective and wide-ranging support for the cause of human rights , from individual projects to programmes promoting human rights and democracy .
A second proposal which I wish to make concerns the setting up of a dedicated data network for this sector .
Ladies and gentlemen , let me close by stating that one of the most difficult and yet rewarding tasks of the European Union must surely be for its institutions to carry to the world the message of peace and freedom which is based on the respect of human rights and the ability to live together in accordance with democratic principles .
The aim of the 1998 Year of Human Rights must be to underpin the respect of universal standards of human rights at national level by effective control , support and deterrence .
In conclusion let me add one more thing : The respect of human rights is a very laudable principle .
And underlying all this are also political implications and these too are problems which we will have to deal with .
Mrs Müller 's report makes this all too clear .
To date , almost ECU 200 million have been spent in this region as part of the Common Foreign and Security Policy .
Are we to believe the rumours that only a voluntary agreement by industry is planned ?
I am grateful that the Commission has now seen its way to doing this , but I would like the Commission to explain to me why it battled for so long against the Parliament 's ideas .
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , we have put these oral questions to you today because we think that the Parliament needs to be provided with comprehensive information on genetically modified foodstuffs at an early stage , and certainly at an earlier point than is usually the case .
If that were true , today 's debate would be superfluous and a repetitive waste of time .
There was time enough for preparatory discussions and clarification , even if it was not quite clear at the outset what form it would take .
Nevertheless , labelling does give anyone wanting to steer clear of genetically engineered products for any reason the option of deliberately avoiding them .
Nor have you said when there will be clear labelling for additives , flavourings and enzymes .
Consumers want to know what they are eating , otherwise they lose faith in food products .
EU enterprises are already engaged in tough competition with US , Turkish , Korean and Iranian companies .
Like the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement , the Interim Agreement also includes the human rights clause .
This is not just for economic reasons , although they also suggest the same course .
I would like to mention in particular the case of Michael Arzinkov.
It is regrettable that the Commission has excluded the social question , despite the fact that some 500 000 jobs have already been lost throughout the European rail industry .
However , it would be in everybody 's interest if we could in some way clarify the definition of "developing countries ' .
Parliament has already dealt with this matter in connection with another report drawn up by the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy .
The urgent need for European industry to improve its competitiveness makes space policy a compulsory subject for the European Council .
What should we be manufacturing in them ?
However , this proposal will not be drawn up until the evening of 1 May .
This is tantamount to Parliament cutting its own throat .
This allows broad sections of the population to participate in economic growth .
Here today , before the European Parliament , I make an appeal to the German Constitutional Court .
We have already had painful experiences of the downside of this , during the Uruguay Round and also in the World Trade Organization .
Mrs Randzio-Plath , you yourself know as well as I do that if dual pricing is to extend - as suggested in Mr Pérez Royo 's report - from the beginning of the third phase , that is from 1 January 1999 , possibly on an optional basis initially , but then if this is not satisfactory , backed up by the force of a regulation , this will of course have a big influence on costs in commerce and may push them up .
Mr President , we need to say something here about the economic substance of the revolution which we are signing up to on all sides .
The information we have acquired is exemplary by the standards of this Parliament , and the general accessibility of today 's debate is important if it is to lead to positive decision-making by the middle of this year .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the introduction of our new single currency calls for optimal accompanying monetary-policy measures .
We also need to encourage people to feel good about the single currency
