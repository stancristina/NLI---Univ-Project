strictly monitored by the Commission .
The negotiations have been hard , and Claude Turmes has devoted a lot of work to them .
The EU should achieve 3 % to 4 % of the reduction in developing countries , leaving just under 9 % .
Our demand is for the burden of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to be divided in a socially acceptable manner .
He headed a good and fair negotiation and I think that the result can be seen for itself .
He has managed to do so .
It failed to respond to the need to protect the climate or to the demands of the energy crisis and we are again passing up an opportunity to ensure there is constructive pressure here until well into the next decade .
Energy and climate change ( conclusion ) Mr President , Mr President-in-Office , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have debated the climate package all day today and the vote will take place tomorrow .
From that point of view , I am looking forward to good cooperation .
However , I ask you in closing to please support my tabled amendment on the EUR 70 limit ; then we will have cleared up much of the debate on imbalances .
We have achieved an increase in the level of deposit guarantees , a clear reduction in payout deadlines in case of a crisis and the abolition of joint deposit guarantees .
Numerous compromises had to be made , but we succeeded in sending out a signal that was important in stabilising the financial markets .
I should also like to extend my thanks to the Commission for its willingness to cooperate .
Parliament is also prepared for a revision of the medium-term financial programme .
The EU is permitted to achieve 3-4 % of the reduction in the developing world , which means that just under 9 % remains .
The directive put to the vote today concerning the EU Emissions Trading Scheme meets none of these requirements .
Compared with the CO2 prices applicable under the Emissions Trading Scheme , the burden on the automobile industry is thus unnecessary and excessive .
I should like to emphasise two significant developments and two challenges .
Firstly , I would like to discuss the multilateral challenge .
In 2004 , the European Parliament was assured that there was a group of Commissioners who would concern themselves with fundamental rights .
Not everyone is familiar with how the close cooperation between schools and industry works - the dual system , that is - and not everyone is aware of the considerable investment in terms of skills , time and cost involved in gaining a master craftsman 's diploma or recognition as a ' Fachwirt ' ( a non-academic professional qualification ) .
The result of this is that we need accords between businesses and the national authorities in relation to educational establishments .
I believe that we have been able to set something in motion here . rapporteur . - ( DE ) Mr President , we have of course attempted to take account of the new situation in our oral amendment .
Mr President , we have , of course , given this matter a great deal of thought .
Many thanks also to the staff involved and to the Commission , to you , shadow rapporteur and Mr Dimas , and also the French Presidency of the Council , but also thanks to fellow members who were not intimidated by the completely exaggerated figures from industry .
I am also pleased that we have succeeded in including animal protection in this regulation and that we were able to establish more transparency , although I would have expected more courage from the Commission .
However , as a group we would , of course , have liked to have clear objectives and clear timetables .
Unfortunately , you did not mention this correction in the PSD study .
To date , 60 % of EU money has been used for road-building projects , while only 20 % goes into public transport and rail .
It is possible , then .
In other words , we had a very ambitious programme , and I have to say that I really do appreciate the fact that , in cooperation with all the institutions involved , we have managed to conclude this project within such a short period .
We now need to get started on implementation , and one reason why we have set relatively tight deadlines for Parliament and for the Council is that we want to ensure that we do not have to wait too long for implementation .
Thank you very much .
The political conclusion from these common successes is that states with a common currency and a common internal market have achieved a unique level of integration that will secure peace and prosperity .
The doubts of the citizens , many of whom , in many Member States , initially believed that the euro would result in huge price hikes , have now disappeared .
The European Central Bank will gain a new task in the coming years .
I agree in principle with Paolo Costa 's report on civil aviation .
I should like to highlight the comment that dialogue between the EU and the Union citizens should be a two-way dialogue , because it is not enough to inform our home countries about the implementation of projects ; we also have to listen to individual people and take their opinion seriously .
The objective is efficiency , which means as much as necessary and as little as possible .
Children must be exempted from the requirements to provide biometric fingerprints for passports .
Otherwise , party conferences would not be broadcast so extensively .
We must achieve this , as we owe this to our soldiers and police officers involved in operations throughout the world .
