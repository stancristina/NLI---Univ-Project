I therefore congratulate the rapporteur , and - along with my group and , I hope , the whole of Parliament - I shall endeavour to uphold her proposals vis-à-vis the common position .
Social protection consists of a set of hard-won social rights which progressively evolve .
Similarly , the joint vote of those two groups prevented paragraphs 11 and 24 , which supported encouraging fishermen " to leave the industry ' , from being removed from the report , as we proposed in the House .
However , it fails to mention the responsibility of transnational business strategies in these processes , or the implications in terms of the abuse of dominant positions and the distortion of economic trends .
It is quite unthinkable that Kyoto should turn out to be a failure .
There lies the Achilles heel of European strategy .
Madam Commissioner , Minister , we shall be together in Kyoto , but I also hope we shall be here in January , when we finally begin to put into practice what we signed up to at the Earth summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 .
That is what needs to be done .
Against this background , we should not forget that the quota was increased not long ago to make the Portuguese sugar-beet conversion unit viable .
It often occurs that even the extraordinary courage of Commissioner Bonino has no effect on the attitudes of Member States .
Is there any harmonization of the criminal law in Europe , or do Member States still think this is a gross attack on their sovereignty ?
The other matter , the other policy at issue is the common agricultural policy .
Mr President , I had intended to put a question to the Commissioner asking whether she knew if the cohesion fund was included in the Commission 's accounts .
If a few Member States ' GDPs do approximate to a very limited extent to the Community average , that cannot conceal the fact that such progress is clearly insufficient in itself and , as such , incompatible and out of line with the fundamental objectives established by the Treaty of Europe in that respect .
The consensus of opinion on these central issues inevitably brings us back to the need to reconsider the level proposed by the Committee for future financial perspectives ( 1.27 % of Community GDP , the same proportion as before , which has been shown to be too low a ceiling for 1999 ) .
Mr Izquierdo Collado 's report makes an excellent critical analysis of the Commission 's three-yearly report , which in itself is a report of high technical quality and great analytical rigour , but , not wishing to be constantly reiterating what has already been said , Mr Izquierdo Collado skillfully bridges the gap with Agenda 2000 , introducing essential ideas on the future of the Union .
Thirdly , the present cohesion countries and regions cannot as a matter of principle pay the costs of enlargement , even partially .
Madam President , the Commission welcomes the draft report by Parliament and expresses its appreciation of the support given by Parliament to the creation of this budget line in 1990 and to policy developments since the Beijing Conference in 1995 .
In both these cases there seems to be substantial policy agreement with the objective of the amendment but we would suggest rewording in order to clarify the text .
In Amendment No 6 , we wish to retain the reference to the need for action against gender disparities 'on an appropriate scale ' .
In Amendment No 12 , we prefer to retain the flexibility of the references to services .
In Amendment No 15 , we support Parliament 's desire to reduce costs to the EC budget but think that the Member States might reasonably wish to retain an option of additional representation for important or specialized projects .
In Amendment Nos 16 and 17 , we appreciate Parliament 's intention but these are internal administrative questions which cannot be appropriately addressed in legislation .
Madam President , the Committee on Women 's Rights is convinced that the draft Treaty of Amsterdam represents a step forward politically , since it codifies the principle of non-discrimination according to sex as a fundamental principle of Community law , and quotes equality of the sexes as one of the objectives of the Treaty on European Union .
Madam President , the Treaty of Amsterdam contains significant advances on issues relating to fundamental rights , non-discrimination , freedom of movement and citizenship and also guarantees of those rights through control by legal institutions and the right of petition itself .
I cannot however say the same , nor should I do so , of the objectives of the institutional reform which is recommended , since these are limited to the decision-making powers of governments , raising the spectre of a Directoire of major states in the face of public opinion and regrettably overlooking other major institutional issues which are relevant to enlargement , such as the reform of the Community budget and the role and resources of economic and social cohesion policies .
But on attaining its majority today the text of the Treaty of Amsterdam goes to each of the States of the Union to be subjected to the risks of debate and national public opinion and , subsequently and consequently , to acceptance or rejection by the citizens of Europe .
To rush into amending a treaty which has not yet reached adulthood might be tantamount to throwing out the baby with the bathwater .
It will be said , as the Jöns report claims , that the outline agreement is a first step towards the creation of a range of legal measures which will gradually eliminate existing forms of discrimination .
The recent inclusion of
