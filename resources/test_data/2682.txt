The power vertical has the objective of achieving control over regions that have previously been inclined to disagree with it .
Ukraine was on a very good path .
Additionally taking account of low carbon production methods and humane working conditions would enable us to incorporate modern challenges .
I would be grateful if the Commission , possibly after the conclusion of the ACTA agreement , would do all it can to ensure that as many other countries as possible sign up to this agreement and would also demonstrate a little flexibility in cases where doubts exist .
If not , when do you intend to sign ?
While we are developing our overall maritime policy , it is important to ensure that the sea does not strike back , as it did in a sensational novel by bestselling author Frank Schätzing .
In the field of energy there is a great deal happening on and around the sea .
I would like to thank everyone who has taken part in the debate today .
Mr Kohlíček , you said that it was difficult to link all the areas together , but I know that this is possible .
We owe that to him and his fellow combatants , to the people of the North Caucasus and also to our murdered friend and comrade Natalia Estemirova , whom many of us knew personally and whose murder must finally be resolved .
We must not turn it into a competition between Chernobyl and the proposal to ask the Council to report on the situation in the Middle East this week and to debate on it , and then put Chernobyl in second place !
The Commission and the Council have constantly declared how vital it is to reduce CO2 and to save energy .
For that is the decisive point here .
There are no laws on this in my country and I am willing to bet they do not exist in most other Member States either .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , the first step is indeed always the most difficult one but we must take it now because we cannot go on like this with the energy policy we have been pursuing to date .
That is why we cannot do everything we want with it and will have to concentrate on certain areas .
The original proposal would have created a risk of the programme being implemented on an independent basis ; that is why we want to be more closely involved .
The Council , however , has made it clear in its unanimously adopted common position that it has different priorities from those of Parliament .
In calling for the customs services to be fully computerized as quickly as possible , Parliament therefore hopes to help prevent fraud and protect jobs .
This is not the right way to go about things .
Thirdly , there is our common interest in lasting innovation for the future , which means that we will always need industrialists , and they in turn will always need a challenge .
As for the use of genetic technology in the production of pharmaceuticals , I can only see the huge opportunities which this offers , and I feel that there is no point in discussing the risks until we can assess the advances that are likely to be made in the treatment of diseases which present a major threat to mankind .
If we include biotechnology , which is of course one of the major fields of innovation and will become particularly important over the next few years , the situation looks even grimmer .
We have introduced a licensing procedure which has , in my opinion , come up to the mark so far , and we shall have to see how it progresses in future .
The protection offered by patents can now be extended , in the sense that the unfortunate situation whereby the testing period had to be deducted from the length of the patent no longer exists .
This is why I am convinced that experience is best of all .
You are , of course , aware that any interference in these systems has enormous political implications , and we have absolutely no intention of harmonizing the Member States ' healthcare systems .
Someone also pointed out how few medicines have been coming onto the market from research recently .
I think we would get a good deal further if you did not always suspect me of saying one thing and meaning another .
Reference is always made in these debates to the consequences of alcohol and nicotine abuse .
The dialogue about combating drugs is not interference : it is European domestic policy .
There has been no movement on the THERMIE programme , a programme on renewable energy , which is being held up by the Council .
Mr President , I should like to support what the previous speakers have said , and in fact I would urge that we vacate the Chamber and suspend the sitting here and now , until Parliament informs us that it can continue in a proper manner .
The citizens of the EU are entitled to require that every last ECU should be managed in a transparent , effective and economical way , and today , like last year , we must once again conclude , on the basis of the Court of Auditors ' analyses , that there are major flaws in the system .
The reasons for taking such a step are obvious , and led the Court of Auditors to comment that it was hard to draw any comparison between what was intended and what was implemented .
A look at the tobacco regulation or the regulations in the wine sector , however , forces one to the conclusion that even five
