Then he slips away because the sole reason why this pack of hounds sits in this Parliament is to permanently set upon others and then slink back into its holes to evade the responsibility of debate .
I only have the following points to add or raise with regard to this excellent report ; firstly , the appropriate training of specialists to be able to also prosecute the perpetrators ; secondly , the need for the capability to carry out legal proceedings at international level ; and thirdly , the need to be able to punish crimes committed in third countries under domestic law .
My fourth point is that the register of persons who have been convicted of the distribution of child pornography or of the sexual abuse of children will hopefully be implemented across Europe as quickly as possible and that access will be available to all Member States and Europol .
It is necessary that the legal basis for the Fund should be adopted as soon as possible so as to ensure continuous EU financing of refugee projects .
When it comes to refugees , the measures should be different to those for displaced persons .
If we can resolve this issue , then we should do so .
We will monitor this .
The Council ' s amendments , which extend the scope of money , cannot be in the interest of the consumer .
The proposed amendment of Directive 95/53/EC fixing the principles governing the organisation of official inspections in the field of animal nutrition is intended to create a legal basis for a harmonised procedure for checking documents and inspecting goods from third countries .
For this they need confidence , and confidence only comes through openness and transparency .
It was not this Parliament , and only to a very minor extent the Commission .
Yet again we are providing an example here right across all the groups , the rapporteur , Mrs Klaß , who has just spoken for her group , and me for my group , of how the institutions work closely together .
Industry will then have to decide the ones it wants .
These measures relate mainly to four areas which still require clarification or the oft-quoted fresh start .
Commissioner ' s Kinnock ' s reform paper , which is broad in scope if nothing else , sets off every single alarm bell in the area of financial control .
The majority of the Committee therefore decided to suspend discharge in order to obtain more information .
There are similar problems with the European Court of Justice .
In addition , contrary to the Commission discharge procedure , we have no cause to complain that we did not receive certain documents .
It has been clearly stated that our own , previously public , competition criteria have been broken for certain positions in order to lever certain persons into those positions .
I hope I do not have to sit in such a Parliament .
Two and a half months ago , you granted the Commission discharge for the 1997 budget .
The fact that the error rate for agricultural expenditure is well below the error rate for the Structural Funds is perhaps due to this financial correction instrument .
But we need a procedure which safeguards the confidentiality of information and , more importantly , the principle of the rule of law whereby people cannot be pre-judged .
I am not in a position at this point to go into the individual points of the resolution in detail .
The interaction between the common agricultural policy and the final beneficiaries currently passes via approved paying agencies in the Member States .
The Commission notes this proposal with interest .
This responsibility on the part of Parliament vis-à-vis European citizens and taxpayers is a heavy burden , which is why discharge for the Commission ' s management of the budget cannot be reduced to a compulsory , but somewhat tiresome annual exercise and I am sorry that the President of the Commission could not be here today .
I take this to mean that it must clear up all the old cases without exception and - where necessary - must pass them to the courts .
Using the pressure of postponement to advance discharge is constructive pressure because it gives the Commission the chance to clear up shortcomings caused by slowness , pettifogging or unwillingness so that Parliament will be able to grant discharge for 1998 as quickly as possible , hopefully before the summer recess .
Obviously it was not possible to submit this action plan in time for today ' s decision .
So things are not improving , Commissioner Schreyer ; they are obviously going in the opposite direction , which is why we must follow the recommendations proposed by Mrs Stauner in the Committee on Budgetary Control as closely as possible .
However , what we could not foresee was that , with the vote on the overall report , outbursts very similar to those at the time of the refusal of discharge for 1996 would occur once again .
Then everyone will have a true picture .
I should like to point out once again in this context that the Commission has passed all the confidential reports requested to the rapporteur , or rather to the Committee on Budgetary Control .
I shall , of course , pass on any requests but I cannot give you any information in lieu of the director of OLAF in this respect .
The Commission has also decided to set up a separate , internal ex-post audit service and I think that this will again demonstrate that the Commission takes the subject of improved financial control extremely seriously .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , Lisbon focused on employment , economic reform and the shift to the digital age .
These symbolic gestures are the right way
