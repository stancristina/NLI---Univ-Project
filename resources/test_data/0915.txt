its action in the field of preventing and combating maritime pollution .
These regional initiatives include the United Nations strategy to implement the Montego Bay Convention ( the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ) and are mirrored by the Lisbon Agreement to protect the Northeast Atlantic .
The European Union chose to divide this task between the Commission and the Member States .
There are , however , scientific papers proving that the majority of the fishing nets most commonly used in Europe are responsible for some cetacean by-catches .
Nevertheless , and despite the findings of some existing scientific papers , I regret the fact that there are no more precise data that would enable a precise calculation to be made of the number of cetacean by-catches , and the European Union must strive to remedy this lack of information as a matter of urgency .
Adopting this measure will bring substantial environmental benefits , without having a significant impact on the fisheries sector , because fishermen will be able to continue using drift-nets outside the fishing zone containing the Darwin Mounds , or , within the protected zone , using towed nets that do not come into contact with the seabed .     .
Aid must also be maintained for renewing and modernising the local fleet , for increasing the eligibility of new species and for fishermen’s active participation in the common fisheries policy .
In this context , we must establish a number of priorities reflected in various support measures , which warrant our attention .
I therefore share the rapporteur’s opinion emphasising that adapting the CFP to the needs of these outermost regions must be done systematically and that defining a coherent and structured policy in this field is much-needed .
I must , however , express my frustration at the JPA’s inability to exert any positive influence over the situation in Zimbabwe .
I believe that communicable diseases constitute an extremely serious threat to the health of citizens and therefore support the Commission proposal to increase the means to effectively control such diseases , specifically by creating a European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control , which would bring together epidemiologists , public health experts , microbiologists , logistics specialists and doctors .
I voted in favour .     .
Recent financial scandals , such as Enron and Parmalat , are further evidence of the consequences of liberalising capital markets and the role of the rating agencies that gave the creditworthiness of these giant transnationals a clean bill of health , even though they did not disclose any information on their activities .
The report manages to ask questions and make diagnoses , but does not prescribe any medicine , which only serves to encourage these self-regulating instruments .
It is significant that he referred to the water supply and drainage , to education and to health services , which , in his opinion , should fall within the competences of the State and local authorities .
Although the directive has been in force since October 1999 , in new installations and existing installations where the operator intends to carry out significant changes , a transitional period has been granted until October 2007 , which requires special support to be granted to industrial SMEs and to farmers .
Concepts such as ‘cross-compliance ’ in the technical conditions of operating licences , sharing best practices and defining best available techniques ( BATs ) , are just some of the ways in which we can ensure the integrated prevention and reduction of pollution resulting from a wide range of industrial and agricultural activities , and in which we can reach a higher level of environmental protection .
The overriding concern is reliability of information , which has often been called into question , thereby creating unwanted tension between investigators , scientists and fishermen .
Scientific research has become an essential instrument in implementing the common fisheries policy and is crucial to the sustainable management of resources .
I should like to take this opportunity to welcome the work of the rapporteur .
Mr Lage’s warning therefore gives the Community the opportunity to base the common fisheries policy on more accurate , more timely advice , thereby leading to a stronger scientific basis than has thus far been detected .
The guarantee of profitable producer prices must , therefore , be the guiding premise of the common agricultural policy , in order to ensure farmers a decent standard of living on a par with other sectors of activity .
In Portugal , 1 % of the major holdings receive almost half of this aid , a situation that we have always contested .
The consumer price index rose , in fact , during the period concerned by around 11 % , while the producer price index fell by more than 1 % .
This is essential if we are to maintain multifunctional agriculture and high quality farm produce .     Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , following the first plan to recover cod stocks , the Commission decided to propose a new initiative , this time on Northern hake .
These limitations have had a devastating socio-economic impact on sea professionals , restricting already limited fishing activity still further .
On various occasions , Parliament has drawn the Commission ’s attention to the excessive inflexibility of the recovery plans .
If the Commission maintains or , should I say , takes the risk of maintaining , the level of financial resources of the EU at 1.24 % of the Community’s gross national product until 2013 , it would be making a decisive investment in the European policy of solidarity , as the only means of achieving the homogenous growth of the entire EU , in the wake of the Lisbon strategy .
