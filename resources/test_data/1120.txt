held did not produce any result at all at first , and the main thing we agreed on was that we disagreed .
It would have been a bad sign if Parliament 's two largest parties had opposed each other on this issue : good for political transparency , perhaps , but bad for any prospect of continuing the line taken in Mrs Schmidbauer 's report .
The second unfortunate fact is that the directive concerns a tax and it will therefore be the Finance Ministers who decide on it .
This means a unanimous vote , but there is no unanimity .
Let me give you just one example .
My second point concerns Annex III .
We could have done this with the Commissioner this evening , and I very much regret the fact that we did not .
Firstly , the setting-up of a European organization for air safety .
I should like to hear the Commissioner 's views on this , either now or at some later point .
Mr President , I wish to raise a point of order - which you know is not something I do very often - about lobbying in the House .
It marks the end of European integration limited to western Europe .
I welcome the fact that Slovenia and Estonia will probably be among the first wave , which is what I myself have urged on a number of occasions , because it will mean that the European Union can play a stabilizing role in areas where NATO cannot yet take action .
I fear that there is speculation in many Member States that the new members will not join in 2002 , but will have to wait until 2005 at the earliest .
We know that the Commission for a long time considered the option of involving them all at the start , and I would like to know what the reasons were for deciding against this , since it is clear that there are political disadvantages involved here , such as the fact that the new borders already being established within the existing Europe will have a NATO border , an EU border , and perhaps even a Schengen border superimposed on them .
In considering enlargement , we must also be prepared to provide adequate funding to pay for it .
When will someone finally admit that membership of the European Union is not just about meeting economic and political requirements , but that there are also geographical and cultural restrictions which mean that a non-European country like Turkey , albeit a good neighbour with whom we have excellent relations , simply cannot become a member of the European Union ?
Spain is causing problems in the association agreement with Jordan over a few tons of tomatoes .
That is what this Interinstitutional Agreement says in effect , and it just goes to show that democracy in Europe is still languishing in the 19th century .
Finally , it remains to be seen whether the Council fulfils its obligation to provide information , as it is required to do under this Interinstitutional Agreement .
In my view , the success of the fight against unemployment depends on the combined efforts of the economies of the Member States .
EMU is meant to eliminate high transaction costs , currency risks and competitive devaluations .
We should not under any circumstances engage in a procedure which would create a feeling of exclusion on the part of tens of millions of Europeans .
Mr President , I should like to take this opportunity to draw the attention of the Luxembourg presidency to a current problem in my country as regards the transposition into Belgian law of the Community directive of 19 December 1994 on voting rights for European citizens .
The Flemings have to say that the speakers of other languages , the newcomers to their territory in Brussels and the vicinity , not only do not adapt , but also try to impose their culture , their languages and their laws .
I am pleased that yesterday , in the Committee on Employment , Mr Juncker specifically asked us to provide a contribution by mid-October .
We shall gladly do that , and I should like to say something now about the effort we should make and our criteria .
I would also like to focus on the commitments of the social partners , and I hope the same goes for Parliament , because they too play an important role .
That is partly true , and partly nonsense .
I am pleased to say that the political instability seems to have been reduced with the arrival of the new government .
And the integration of Northern Cyprus clearly implies a second invasion .
I welcome the fact that the positions of the Council , the Commission and Parliament with regard to Turkey have clearly moved towards each other in recent years .
So this review of the programme is tremendously important .
She has highlighted the drawbacks of the agreements and also set out very clear and strict criteria which they have to meet .
Our amendments need no further explanation , and I hope the rapporteur will accept them .
In my view , therefore , this legal status needs to be clarified .
The objection that third parties might not be adequately protected does not hold water if the agreement is given proper legal form .
I understand the position of the Commissioner , who of course still sees some rays of hope , but in the end I think we have to conclude that progress has been incredibly slow , and that the UN has once again shown that it has become a bureaucratic machine , where countries fly in , make fine statements , depart , and then repeat that little or nothing has been done .
