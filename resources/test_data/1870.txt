which use it to increase their own power and - it must be said - to enable the State apparatus to exercise control over thought and the education system .
Since their powers are limited , the States cannot act beyond their own borders .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , as Mr von Wogau has pointed out in the presentation of his report - which has my Group ' s full support - we are at an historic moment , with the culmination of the process of introducing the euro so close , but we are also , as has been said , at a delicate moment for the European economy .
Nevertheless , the guidelines still apply to the Union as a whole .
It is also the case that this year the new model established at the Lisbon Summit and the debate in the European Council on two questions which are fundamental to the drawing up of the broad economic guidelines have reduced the time available for the creation of this document , and this has also affected the European Parliament .
This is the importance of the document we are discussing today .
Of course , if only the large countries are obliged to comply with the broad economic policy guidelines , then , in the end , our model would become highly contradictory .
These figures must clearly be borne in mind .
We also believe , of course , that in this respect it is essential to improve the working capacity and level of activity of our populations , but , to this end , it is imperative that we make progress on structural reforms , both of the markets and of the labour system .
We believe that we have to do more , both in relation to pension systems and in relation to increasing the level of activity in the various countries .
Mr Florenz ' s work is commendable and I must congratulate him on it , since he has managed to create some proposals for directives which find a balance between the interests of consumers , the environment and businesses in the sector , interests which are very difficult to combine .
Mr President , we are debating the revision of Directive 92/59/EEC on general product safety and there is a priority which the Commission , the Council and the European Parliament share , which is to improve consumer health and safety .
We agreed with the majority of the proposal made to us .
There are more difficulties with other amendments , such as those which refer to the exporting of unsafe products to the Third World and to the safety of services .
We therefore believe that by supporting the proposal of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , we are also supporting principles which are of paramount importance to the European Union .
However , I must be absolutely critical in relation to two of them .
We are always talking about the biodiversity of nature , but we do not take account of the fact that , within our programmes in general , there is a lack of projects and working programmes concerning man ' s environment : both the natural environment and , above all , the urban environment , where man actually lives .
Therefore , let us look after that environment and bear in mind that , although the biodiversity of ways of life and settings is important , I believe that the European Union is currently moving away to a large extent from sustainability , in the sense that only gigantic projects are given massive funding , as in the case of the URBAN project .
The problem is that it must be complied with , and I know that the European Commission has initiated legal proceedings against a number of countries .
Please be more specific and more precise and tell me what you feel about the killing of Algerian Berbers resulting from the police charge at the end of April in Algeria .
In our opinion , in tackling the problem of poverty , various dimensions should be considered : the general economy , the structural reforms necessary to improve the level of growth and the standard of living , and also the correct use of structural funds and the implementation of specific policies to improve employment .
I believe that there is little difference between my initial position and your comments .
In order to increase employment , it is not enough to implement measures of a structural nature , such as reducing tax and social costs .
The Commission expects to have greater knowledge of this data , not more precise knowledge , but rather better knowledge from the point of view of compliance with the recommendations , in order subsequently to present the Council with its assessment .
Nor will these approaches help us achieve greater equilibrium in terms of the current account balance .
I believe that the fundamental rule is that we must comply with what is agreed .
We must all therefore behave coherently in terms of the national economic policy we adopt in accordance with the Treaty , but it must also coordinated in accordance with the Treaty .
But , from a legal point of view , from the point of view of our legal commitments , the situation is the same for all countries , large or small .
An agreement was reached in Vienna at the end of 1998 , on the basis for a Commission proposal which , however , the Member States did not take up .
Secondly , the Fund itself is currently subject to a review of its statutes , a factor which must also be taken into account in order to make progress on the process of external representation
