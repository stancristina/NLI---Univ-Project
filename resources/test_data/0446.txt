This should be properly taken into account when recognising certificates of competency from a third country .
Madam President , today 's regulation is a milestone in our history .
The IGC changes that , and quite rightly so .
Fourthly , there is more clarity regarding the rights of people who fall ill abroad .
Incidentally , my colleagues and I have submitted an amendment on that point ; I would like the Council to say a unanimous ''yes ' to an amendment that gives Luxembourg a transitional period of five years , as it is particularly affected by the new regulation because of the large number of cross-border workers there .
Would Amendment No 20 not cause the regulation to run into problems ?
Just one look at the statistics shows us that only around 2 % of the citizens work in another country .
I still , however , hesitate to advise people to actually do this unless 100 % guarantees can be given concerning sound and proper social security .
I am therefore pleased that in its proposal , the European Commission is making every effort to enforce cooperation by the Member States .
It is then very good if we can make a little progress .
If you engage in conversation with frontier workers , as has already been mentioned in the form of personal recollections , they will tell you that the problems know no bounds .
We are also keeping a few issues open , and I think that we should take the following historical steps at some point .
One can dream of greater labour mobility and of lifting internal borders for those looking for work .
This has been a laborious process and has not by any means reached completion , but , fortunately , clear guidelines have now been drafted for it .
In my view , we should most definitely take this into consideration when we settle on our final opinion .
The Commission has assured us that those problems cannot all be solved within the Regulation and this is why we have shifted a number of amendments from the articles to the recitals .
This suggests that we are dealing with a very difficult issue politically speaking .
That is why the Regulation is also used to limit rights rather than to increase them .
That is therefore a matter which needs re-addressing and which remains an issue .
Brazil has asked whether we are able to promise at this stage that we will be supporting this blue box - in other words the switch from product subsidy to blue-box subsidy - but that we will not be making improper use of it for the purpose of export subsidies .
Secondly , I should like to ask you how you feel about a larger parliamentarian dimension to the WTO ?
The DG for the Regions did want to grant the subsidy and subsequently asked the European Investment Bank to draft a socio-economic report about the economic viability of the JÃºcar project .
All too often , antenatal pregnancy diagnostics is only used to determine whether an unborn child has a disability , whereupon , in the case of a disability , an induced termination of pregnancy is proceeded with .
In this area , we can state without any hesitation that we should not ask ourselves how much the programme is costing the Community , but rather how much it is generating .
This think tank could suggest possible projects and make it easier to set priorities during the process of selecting them .
Politics has an important role to play in this .
DAPHNE I had a budget of EUR 20 million , but that turned out to be insufficient .
Finally , I support the appeal for a European year against violence .
We must give a clear signal to the regime in Cuba that we no longer tolerate the situation .
Quite a few Members of this House are guilty of this rather simplistic way of thinking .
I would like to ask you to make a change to the nominal list .
If this is the case , my group can withdraw the request for a split vote .
This Parliament spends many session hours every month on fundamental human rights in countries outside of Europe .
Mr President , how can the European institutions help the much-troubled Iraqi people ?
As long as economic or strategic interests are paramount to human rights for us , one can continue to enter into dialogue until the cows come home , but obviously little will change .
Of all our written questions , not one was answered in time .
Half of the world 's population lives in countries where freedom of religion is restricted .
Clashes among , and within , religions represent a very serious threat to human rights and world peace , with , moreover , the risk that religious confrontations outside of Europe will have repercussions on our own multi-religious societies .
Children .
After all , the European Union is at risk of losing all credibility if it does not succeed in speaking with one voice , even if strategically or economically important countries , such as China or Russia , are involved .
If these conditions are not met , the European Union should seriously consider withdrawing from the human rights circus .
After all , they are in many cases the heroes of civil liberties .
I find this a bit worrying , to be honest .
Mr President , this is the fourth plenary debate in this parliamentary period on the human rights situation in the European Union .
First of all , our work has become more systematic and objective , because we have taken the Charter of Fundamental Rights as our guiding principle .
I think that we should emulate this approach where human rights violations within the European Union
