I also have the impression , like Mrs Kauppi , that in the Commission you would only prefer to have these supervisors as advisors and not really have an independent role for them to play , for instance in the international connection , in connection with the IASB standard-setting board or the FSF.
Follow-up measures must chiefly originate on their side .
It would be possible , if the Belarusian authorities were prepared to do so , to restart that dialogue via a kind of troika of the European Parliament , the OSCE and the Council of Europe .
Electoral law that makes it easy to exclude the entire opposition from parliament is bad electoral law .
This is also why all the European institutions , without affecting their own political credibility and subject to strict conditions ( see paragraph 10 of the resolution ) , should seek gradual engagement with Minsk .
I consider it an important tangible step in this direction that we adjust - that is , lower ( see paragraph 13 of our resolution ) - the cost of the EU visa for Belarusians : currently EUR 60 for Ukrainians as against EUR 35 for Russians .
Debates on oil shortages are tremendously heated , and I sometimes wonder why this is not the case for water .
For example , we first need investment , throughout Europe and beyond , in proper sanitation and water purification systems .
Study results from the IPCC have shown that the risks will only increase in coming years .
Sorry , I have the wrong one .
That was the case with this directive .
In the present directive this sector can really prove to be mature and to have a good social dialogue with trade unions , and then help reach very advanced arrangements for flexibility and security in the labour market . on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( NL ) Madam President , before I address the matter in hand , I should like to propose that , in future , we ask each Council presidency to bring a wax doll or a blow-up doll to this Chamber , since the Council itself is always absent from debates of this kind and I do like to address somebody .
I believe human rights , those of women in particular , to be strengthened , not weakened , by this .
If I understand it correctly , the Commission is hanging onto a European solution for the time being .
Whilst it is the parents , and not the government , who should determine what is right and in the interest of the child , it should be possible to reach a suitable solution , preferably one where the children are cared for by both parents .
It is understandable , in my view , that the first question is dealt with at European level .
The Council has publicly made solemn pledges to involve the European Parliament , but now we see what the pledges of the Council are worth - nothing .
However , only a few Member States - I think it is three so far - have either a PNR system in place or plans for such a scheme .
Any evidence so far provided by the US is anecdotal and , to be honest , the information that we got from various US government agencies over the last year or so only seems to demonstrate that the mass collection and processing of PNR is not useful at all .
So it is totally unclear how this data could serve to identify high-risk persons .
Automated systematic analysis of PNR of all passengers can be useful for other purposes , for example combating drug trafficking or illegal immigration .
It is not about security in other countries .
What matters is , and in that respect I totally agree with the rapporteur , that you have to look very carefully at how this instrument can be best used and when usefulness and need are really defined .
Could you respond to this ?
I am not the only one who is of this view ; I am in good company .
But we must be very precise in defining the purposes so as to ensure proportionality and to ensure adequate legal safeguards .
It is particularly this cause which the Commission would like to address with the new cod recovery plan .
The new rules , as far as I can see , are a step in the right direction .
The financial crisis demonstrates yet again how much we rely on Russia , but also how much Russia relies on the international economy .
The fact that the world has changed completely , compared to 30 or 40 years ago , is another reason why returning to cold-war tactics is not an option .
It may , in this regard , be important to remind ourselves of the need to have a wider debate about the safety structures and regulations that are in place , under the name of the Helsinki process , in Europe too .
It makes for sustainable vehicle development , because demand for sustainable vehicles is promoted , which spurs manufacturers on to innovate .
The big problem was that Member States implemented the directive differently .
The cooling-off period of fourteen days is , to my mind , also a very important matter .
This is all possible in a compromise .
I am glad that , with this maximum harmonisation , all European consumers will be given the same rights .
I hope we will approve the text , because it represents a huge step forward for consumer rights in Europe and will give the European tourism industry an enormous boost .
We do , however , need an approach other than the one
