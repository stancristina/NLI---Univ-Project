Yes , we do need a legal framework .
It is difficult to make progress in the area of illegal immigration management without having a general framework for legal immigration , which we should already have under the Tampere agenda .
As regards more specifically the conditions for expulsion and residence of third-country nationals , I would like to bring to your attention two very important points .
The European Central Bank must fight against inflation , but also against recession .
Nevertheless , as we all saw , Mr Trichet renounced his nationality in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , saying ' I 'm not a Frenchman' - in order to gain the good graces of the Commission , in which he appears to have succeeded .
The role of a central bank governor today , unless he or she wishes to be a permanent scapegoat , is to remind governments of this responsibility .
You were right to want to put an end to this .
Since this debate opened , we have scored points by tabling proposals for amendments that substantially improve the original draft .
Furthermore , your directive is at best ambiguous , because your definition of a computer-implemented invention in Article 2( a ) , can just as easily apply to software .
Nor do I understand the amnesia we are seeing here with regard to the disastrous directive on patenting life .
At a time when we want to encourage innovation , growth and competitiveness within the European Union , in the form of a simple legal harmonisation and clarification of the varying practices and interpretations in this area , this directive represents a real step backwards , a real change of approach in relation to the European Patent Convention and to the directive on software copyright , because it seeks to extend to the limit the possibilities of patenting this software .
I am thinking here of the dissolution of the TDI Group , which was an extremely serious political act given that even Member States no longer ban political parties !
There should be no more shifts of this type .
As to the Schmidt report , we do not support its call to 'arrive at a solution to the issue of safe third States ' .
.
We do not worship at that altar .
.
The European Union does , however , have a legislative arsenal at its disposal in the field of maritime safety .
What is missing , however , is a system of monitoring and penalties that gives effective expression to everything for which we are voting in this House .
Whatever the case , it is , in actual fact , following the double disaster of the Erika and the Prestige that it appears necessary to take stock of the relevance of the measures adopted , of the initiatives taken by the Member States and regions affected by the oil slicks , of the issues of liability and compensation and , above all , of the persistent gaps in international law concerning ships in transit outside territorial waters .
There are two reasons why this amendment is unacceptable to the PSE Group .
As a final word on the subject of development aid , I remain convinced that , without a serious review of the financial perspectives , the pressure upon this heading will become unbearable .
I think that we are in a decisive year for the integration of Europe and for the image of Europe .
The payments for 2000-2006 were made more quickly than before .
In view of the time required to guarantee the quality of the checks and the consultations that the procedures require , ladies and gentlemen , despite the best efforts of my services and those of the Commission we shall be unable to pay all the appropriations earmarked for 1994-1999 in 2003 .
What are the budgetary effects of this enlargement ?
As you see , the Commission has adopted a prudent and realistic approach in the light of the implementation of earlier years .
Mr President , Commissioner , President-in-Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , still on the subject of regional policy , transport and tourism , I have to say to you that we are quite worried , not to say disillusioned , by our reading of the draft budget .
Mr Hatzidakis , what applies to this period is not n+2 but , you might as well say , n+11 .
Mrs Jensen , I shall be continuing the efforts we have begun .
Nevertheless , from a statistical point of view the budget for justice and internal affairs has increased by 252 % this year .
I am also pleased with the two amendments which the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs has proposed concerning the VIS system and the new generation Schengen information system , SIS II .
I would also like to stress , as Mr Perry has said , that we attach great importance to the use of audiovisual systems .
You may know that several of us have tabled amendments to restore the lines to what they were last year .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the European Parliament for inviting me this evening .
The French state will not therefore become an Alstom shareholder in the immediate future and will not adopt any measures likely to constitute equity capital , that is structural measures to which the Commission cannot agree without prejudicing the findings of the competition inquiry it will be conducting .
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to emphasise that there is absolutely no position of principle involved on the part of the Commission concerning the system of ownership of undertakings in the Member States .
The first of these issues is the
