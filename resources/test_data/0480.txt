Because I like gorgonzola , Mr President : gorgonzola cheese , taleggio cheese from the valleys around Bergamo .
It was certainly a matter that needed regulating .
I am truly amazed that the presidency has not announced an initiative at European level involving civil society .
This will also facilitate the preparations for the Laeken Council which should be preceded by a great conference of European national parliaments , the natural follow-up to the public debate supposed to have taken place this year .
You have called for maximum transparency in the debate now beginning and in the whole process described in the Nice Declaration , with a debate as close as possible to the citizens .
Mrs Lindh , we feel sure the Swedish Presidency will want to commit itself to dispelling the extraordinary suspicion meeting every proposal made by any of the groups in the European Parliament .
When I stood before this House just a year ago , it was to present to you the Commission 's contribution to the Lisbon Summit .
As a basis for this assessment , the Commission will produce an annual progress report ( known as the 'Synthesis Report ' ) , which I shall present to this House every year at about this time .
Sometimes it is because circumstances have changed and a new scenario confronts us .
Industry and science are clamouring for it , as it will boost competitiveness and employment - especially in the new sectors we need most .
If this is switched off for military reasons , European businesses are forced to suspend many of their operations and there are a number of other examples .
I will not go into the whole caboodle , to coin a phrase , just the last point : 'Effective social protection for an ageing population ' .
In other words , a shrinking workforce will have to support a rapidly growing number of non-working people even in the enlarged European Union .
These are stark , statistical facts that we have to take into consideration .
Today , our societies are - on average - the wealthiest in history .
They are intergenerational equity , distribution of work , social and family policy and immigration .
Quite apart from the difficulties preventing young people from entering the labour market early enough , there is a trend towards early retirement that shortens people 's working lives by 10 years or more .
Lifelong learning is essential in order to update people 's skills constantly and enable them to adapt to change .
Bringing young people with the right skills into the European Union is another way to increase the size of our workforce .
This process must be enhanced .
However , the Commission is fully committed to bringing the single market into full play here .
We are not talking about a tax revolution here : this is a matter of an extremely sensible adjustment , to which the citizens have every right .
Fourthly and lastly , we need to incorporate the long-term sustainability aspect of public finances into Economic and Monetary Union .
The Commission will be proposing just such a strategy , and it will be the main subject of the Gothenburg Summit in June .
Mr President , the headlong and often uncontrolled development of society and the economy calls for an extra effort at the Stockholm Council .
The record companies and the economy have closed Napster down .
All that means is that our Member States do not want to be controlled in implementing Community environmental standards .
'It ' s me , do n' t you recognise me ? ' ' Me who ? ' ' Me , Carlo Fatuzzo !
Mr President , as a representative of pensioners and the Pensioners ' Party , I voted for this report , which establishes the national emission ceilings for certain atmospheric pollutants : sulphur dioxide , nitrogen oxides , volatile organic compounds and lastly , Mr President , ammonia , NH3 .
Well , I would like that work to be done with breaks , so that older drivers of articulated lorries can have a rest , if only to warm themselves up .
I feel the time has come to change that .
So if you vote for the report on cooperation between courts , I will always enjoy listening to you even more . '
Mr President , I am prompted to say ' How cold it is ! '
However , we may be forgiven for presuming to think that it is not so much a question of the excellence of that agenda as of its proper implementation nationally , in other words how the Member States carry through the processes of change , how they reconcile them with quality of life and work , and how they apply the strategy of greater social cohesion .
Madam President-in-Office of the Council , a few brief words , because it seems to me that the debate has revealed a very clear line : firm , general agreement on the project to be pursued , the great importance of the path set out at Lisbon , and the need to continue in that direction at Stockholm .
The European Union probably ought to devote more attention to making return immigration easier , ensuring that there are active populations in those countries who are genuinely committed to redevelopment and pursuing a process of peace and tranquillity in their homelands .
However , the Italian Parliament is still trying to obtain more information on at least 368 journeys which Mr Caselli made in connection with meetings unrelated to official business , and on the costs incurred in connection with those journeys .
The European Parliament would at least like to have a power of consultation in this matter and to know what criteria
