Constitutionalising the Treaties and division into two parts is not acceptable to the EPLP , and the same concerns about unanimity apply here .
The EPLP wishes to see a Charter of Fundamental Rights , but until the content of the Charter is determined , the question of giving it binding legal force should be left open .
Whilst greater coordination is required at European level over our airspace ( i .e .
Eurocontrol ) , service provision should remain at national level - the Commission has never suggested a single agency and Eurocontrol already exists to coordinate .
The Commission has not previously called for the establishment of a single European air traffic control agency and the request in this report is superfluous .
Mr President , firstly let me say to my colleague and friend , Ms McKenna , that there is nothing in what she said that I do not agree with .
No Member of this House can remain unmoved by the harrowing situation in which so many Iraqi people find themselves .
The facts have been presented by respected international bodies such as UNICEF.
We have no reason whatsoever to doubt their veracity .
There are shortages of essential foodstuffs and agricultural infrastructure resulting in severe nutritional deficiencies .
Iraq , once one of the most economically advanced countries of the region , is being reduced to underdevelopment .
But let there be no illusion as to the role of the Iraqi regime in the suffering of its people .
The consistent refusal by the regime to fully implement United Nations resolutions has led to a situation where the sanctions remain firmly in place almost ten years after the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq .
Furthermore , the refusal of the regime for five years to accept the oil-for-food programme has certainly contributed to the humanitarian situation .
We , in Parliament , are well-intentioned towards the people of Iraq and are serious in our desire for a peaceful and lasting solution .
We must concentrate our efforts on convincing Iraq to implement the United Nations resolutions .
We must make it very clear in this forum that United Nations resolutions are legally binding on all members of the United Nations .
The European Parliament must not be seen to undermine the legitimacy of such resolutions in any way .
Any such action would be grist to the propaganda mill of the Iraqi regime .
It is within the power of the regime to have the sanctions imposed by the United Nations lifted .
To date , the regime most regrettably has preferred to allow its people to be threatened by disease and starvation than to respect international law .
Full implementation of Resolution 1284 obliges Iraq , among other things , to cooperate with the Red Cross in overseeing the repatriation of detainees .
Let us recall that last January this House voted unanimously a resolution calling on Iraq , as a minimum , to provide answers to the Red Cross as to the whereabouts of the missing Kuwaitis for which there is documented evidence .
I too have met some of these people .
I have shared their suffering with them .
Let us clearly understand that is a tragedy in itself .
We are caught between a rock and a hard place .
It is heartbreaking to see innocent children being sacrificed by their own leaders for purely personal , political motives .
Mr President , I am as concerned as anybody in this House about the suffering of the people of Iraq as the result of sanctions but also of the actions of their own government .
We should all remember that sanctions are sometimes better than the alternatives that we may have to consider .
If we are to support this resolution then Iraq must most definitely honour its obligations under all the United Nations resolutions .
We , as a Parliament , must stand by our resolution of January this year , calling for the release of all Kuwaitis and other non-Iraqi nationals who are still imprisoned in Iraq .
I had the opportunity to visit Iraq last month .
I met the families of the Kuwaiti prisoners .
I can tell you that fathers do not forget their sons , brothers do not forget their brothers , children do not forget their fathers ; nor should this House .
We should remind Saddam Hussein that he must honour his obligations to the international community and we shall then honour our obligations to Iraq .
Mr President , we should be clear that already some 17 Jews have already been executed in Iran for charges of espionage , which basically involves no more than contacting anyone in the outside world , certainly anyone in Israel or the United States .
That seems to me an unacceptable position for any country that claims to respect human rights .
These 13 who were arrested were arrested in secret ; nobody knew of their whereabouts for two or three months .
In addition , these 13 were all religious leaders or leaders of the Jewish community .
Therefore , we can only interpret this trial as a deliberate attack on the Jewish community in Iran .
We know that there will not be a free trial ; it will not be open to the public and we have no idea whether these people will have representation .
Let us send our message very clearly from this Chamber .
If Iran claims to respect human rights , trials like this should never be allowed to happen .
Mr President , we should be clear as to why this resolution today is so important .
Firstly , we all know that there is a wave of judicial executions across the USA - over 600 since 1977 - but this would be the first federal execution since 1963 .
Secondly , it is important because this
