In particular , with regard to Italy , to lay down a period of not more than six months within which to apply the sanctions would be against the Italian Constitution , which , in fact , provides for the adoption of a constitutional resolution .
Mr President , we have no hesitation or uncertainty in rejecting the request , which is unexpected in this context , to breach the Italian Constitution .
We will be able to intervene more effectively in countries which deny the existence of human and social rights - whether these are the rights of Kurds , Palestinians , Chechens or the rights of Afghan women - if we avoid hypocrisy .
Madam President , I would like to congratulate Mr Haarder on his comprehensive , balanced , informed and exhaustive report .
You say that no magistrate who has held the office of Public Prosecutor can perform the functions of a judge .
In France and Italy , the regulations in force provide for the very opposite of this single career path .
Mr Haarder has described the situation within the 15 Member States , and the implication is that there is certainly much work still to be done .
We must overcome this and incite our governments to be European through and through .
Now , in all probability , some of the States are at fault in that they have not aligned themselves with certain directives .
For its part , the Commission replied to Oral Question H-0826/99 - on the fact that Italy is the country most severely criticised by the Court of Human Rights for slow and inefficient legal proceedings and that in Belgium trials linked to paedophilia proceed with slowness and worrying delays - by saying that 'it is not for the Union to interfere with the administration of justice in the Member States' , that it had set up an administrative structure which would , if necessary , be instructed to examine cases of serious and persistent violation of fundamental rights by a Member State , applying the criteria and principles already laid down by the European Court of Human Rights and the Court of Justice of the European Communities , and that , at present , no serious and persistent violation of human rights by a Member State was being examined .
We are particularly concerned by the fact that the rapporteur is satisfied with the progress made by Mexico in the area of human rights and democracy since the application of the global agreement .
However , I also call for scrutiny , care and prudence regarding this agreement for its entire duration .
It was with regret that I learned that only some of these amendments had been included in Mrs Read ' s report .
Mr President , before we vote on paragraph 45 , I would like the rapporteur to hear what I have to say .
This a serious translation error .
This time , according to some versions , we are told to protect child abusers .
He appeared to me to be saying the complete opposite regarding the decision taken .
Once again , the wishes of the Chamber have been disregarded .
Democracy only exists on paper : it is not applied within this Parliament .
In this sense , the new Charter could be the basis for a philosophy which some or all of the Member States could incorporate into their own legal systems .
We utterly reject a resolution which cancels out its positive points with such abominations , and we are sounding the alarm bells in dismay .
Even today , this right is still being suppressed , under various different pretexts .
Today , we want to express our solidarity with the journalists and democrats whose rights have been violated and declare our commitment to fighting the Milosevic Government ' s suppression of the freedom of the press and the freedom of speech .
The British and American Governments have already given it to be understood that , in this case , hostilities would be resumed .
I feel that it would be more destabilising for the regime to return to a more comfortable situation in terms of trade , to a situation in which the people have at least some hope of happiness , rather than to continue with the embargoes which , at this stage , are not succeeding in overthrowing the regime , but are simply inflicting enormous suffering on the people and , in particular , on Iraqi children .
Mr President , I must confess that I am extremely unhappy that we are not going to vote on this motion today .
We are familiar with the way in which organised crime uses activities such as cigarette smuggling , which do not always seem , and I stress that this is only an illusion , to be very serious , in order to sabotage any possible opposition .
The tragic death of two customs and excise officers is a European issue as well as a question of Italian public safety , and it is not just a question of European safety , but also , and above all , an issue which has a bearing on our relations with our neighbours across the Adriatic .
The Adriatic is a border and so is the Ionian Sea .
After all , security is one of Europe ' s objectives in the Treaty of Amsterdam and was on the agenda of the European Council held in Tampere in the autumn of 1999 .
Mr President , I do not know whether there has been an interpreting error , but Mr Evans called us the "technical group of racists " , whereas we are the Technical Group of Independent Members .
On many occasions , these words proved to be an end unto themselves and did not provide specific occasions for taking up the opportunities offered .
However , in all this , we must not forget
