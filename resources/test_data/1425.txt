On a political level , there may have been the resignations and there may therefore be a majority as far as the form is concerned but that is an entirely separate argument .
This is the suggestion which I should like the House to approve , but at the same time I would like to support the studies you are carrying out with a view to making a practical proposal , so that the new financial perspective and the new budget also contain a pm entry , a specific reference to this extra weapon for our common trade policy .
I am firmly convinced that increasing the efficiency and accountability of the Commission in future largely depends on greatly reducing the grey areas which currently tend to blur the demarcation lines of autonomy and responsibility between those performing more political tasks and those more involved with administration .
