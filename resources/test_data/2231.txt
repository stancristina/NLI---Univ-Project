What you did not explain , and what I would like you to explain now , is how an organisation that has never been found guilty or even accused of any terrorist crime or any other crime on European soil can be included on this list , whilst Iran , for example , one of whose diplomats has already been convicted by a German court for committing a terrorist attack , does not appear on the list and is actually encouraging the proscription of organisations that oppose it and naming them as terrorists .
These are important but are not enough and we have a particular responsibility because we awarded the 2002 Sakharov Prize to Osvaldo Pay√° .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I should like to ask you whether you do not find it strange that the positions you have adopted are not those held by judges , or by anyone independent ; instead they are the Council 's own political positions on terrorist organisations when nowhere in the press is there any mention of the matter .
Since this is the case , it would be desirable also to apply the policy of open coordination , to which the European Parliament is fully committed , to the areas of culture , youth , the media and sport .
We therefore need an interinstitutional agreement that provides for Parliamentary intervention in order to ensure that not only rules but also policies are established coherently , based on objectives and having indicators , entailing access to documentation and participation in steering meetings and in meetings for studying the progress made , providing information on the reports and best practices , in a process that develops the open method of coordination as the Community method .
Recent events relating to the collapse of various companies that had systems of employee participation in capital demonstrate the potential risks linked to this system .
The discussion is not , however , about the 'how ' but more about the basic 'aim ' of the proposal .
It was only in 1964 , for example , that the women 's 800 metres was introduced .
I also welcome the fact that the Commissioner has also referred to this European Year of the Disabled .
The Commission is proposing three fundamental changes : the introduction of a law stipulating that crude oil and its heavy fractions be transported only in double hull oil tankers ; the rapid withdrawal from service of single hull oil tankers ; and more widespread application of the special oil tanker inspection scheme ( the programme for assessing the seaworthiness of ships ) .
The challenge we face is drastically to reduce breast cancer mortality rates in Europe , but also to eliminate disparities between Member States where the quality of health care is concerned and , consequently , women 's chances of survival .
To help patients to get through the treatment phase as painlessly as possible , they must be given access to psychological support , physiotherapy and social services .
The purpose of the amendments that we adopted is clearly that ultimately everything should remain within the budget .
Furthermore , financial participation contributes to achieving two aims : completing the European social model and increasing employment .
( PT ) Following recent reports that have called into question the reliability of the controls organised in various Member States , updating the rules on official controls of products of animal origin is crucial , particularly in the case of fresh meat , bivalve molluscs and milk .
The measures recommended in the proposal will consequently enable us to hold all those involved at any stage of the food chain more accountable , allowing for higher levels of consumer confidence , which has been dealt severe blows by recent crises .
( PT ) Authorisation for smoke flavourings in food is at the moment totally deregulated in the European Union - some Member States have restrictions in place and others have no legislation at all in this area .
( PT ) I have voted in favour of this report , which highlights the importance of clarifying rules in the field of human health .
We regret the fact that our proposals have not been adopted , specifically those concerning modulation ; doubling the additional amount of aid for farmers who receive less than EUR 5 000 and exempting farmers who receive less than EUR 10 000 from cuts , which would be funded to a limit of EUR 100 000 per farmer .
The Commission proposal does not increase appropriations for rural development .
( PT ) I congratulate Mr Olsson on the excellent report he has produced on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation (EC ) No 1257/1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund ( EAGGF ) and repealing Regulation (EC ) No 2826/2000 .
.
We also reject the idea of aid for the potato starch sector , which supports huge food corporations from only a few Member States , when what is really needed is regulation and support for potatoes for consumption .
The Commission 's reasoning turns on environmental issues , specifically the use of fossil fuel for dehydrating and even the use of irrigation .
Accordingly , whilst acknowledging the importance of the environmental factor , we agreed with the rapporteur on the need to continue with the present CMO , to strengthen market instruments and to increase total aid to EUR 68 per tonne from the marketing year 2004/2005 onwards .
This proposal for a regulation is unacceptable .
In this proposal for a regulation , the Commission proposes to prolong a reformed dairy quota system until the 2014/15 marketing year , and says nothing about the future .
.
We agree with the rapporteur 's proposals for intervention prices to be increased with regard to the Commission proposal , for total
