The Commission 's priority task should therefore be to improve the effectiveness of the funds deployed under the programme and , more importantly , to enhance its visibility .
The common strategy is one of them .
Mr President , this debate is already overdue because the BSE crisis has huge implications for feedingstuffs , both home-grown and imported .
How can he say he does not have any precise information ?
We in this Parliament have already incorporated the further developments clause in the agreement with Macedonia .
I believe this question has to be treated separately and must not be part of the agreement .
It has stopped supporting separatist movements in Bosnia and Herzegovina .
The Commission 's four guidelines set out approaches that I find very welcome .
We must finally remove the obstacles that prevent it from acting independently , especially with regard to recruiting staff and to its own structure .
If we are to fight fraud efficiently , we must bring together all police , administrative and criminal law resources , for this is a matter of the European taxpayers ' money and indeed of far more than that .
Its task would be to direct the relevant OLAF investigations and to make it easier for the competent national courts to prosecute these crimes .
I believe that is an opportunity for us in this situation , because Parliament and the Commission can achieve something jointly .
It is precisely in this area that thanks to the creation of OLAF we have a very powerful instrument .
Here the overall situation remains as unsatisfactory as ever , especially as regards cooperation with the Member States , not because of any unwillingness but because of the structural inadequacies and difficulties that exist in this field .
It is a clear declaration of belief in the rights of each and every Member to request and obtain information from the Commission , including confidential documents .
We are convinced that with its administrative reform the Commission has made and is still making substantial progress here .
Commissioner , the point of departure for forwarding information to the European Parliament is the EC Treaty and not the Interinstitutional Agreement .
To inscribe in a directive that shareholders must be paid an equitable price is about as useful as saying that an apple will fall from the tree when it is ripe .
In the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market we managed to find compromise amendments over and above the groups .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is very important that after more than ten years of deliberations at EU level the important question of the minimum harmonisation of take-over law can be regulated by a useful framework directive , although , as Mr Lehne said , the final proposal raises a few technical problems as also problems of content and we assume that unfortunately this proposal can only be improved through the conciliation procedure .
British lobbyists against this Europe , against any hint of the social model that keeps being paraded in the electoral campaigns .
Does might come before right ?
Moreover , the artist is assigned a right of information so that he can make his claims to royalties known to a professional art dealer during a period of up to three years , which is reasonable since the dealer has to keep the accounts of his purchases and sales .
In the end , the issue is the competitiveness of the European art market , which is already finding it hard to fight off foreign competition .
When we discuss postal services , we have to speak about three things .
The Commission proposed that legal certainty be created in the realm of the so-called special services , which is understandable , given the problems that exist here , especially in the Directorate-General for Competition .
Competition in the postal sector , as it has done elsewhere , will ensure that we have a more effective and an affordable service for consumers .
The Belgian Post Office cannot claim to serve a country of vast dimensions , nor can it claim to serve a remote country on the periphery of Europe .
These things must also be our concern .
I believe that a guaranteed universal service is the only way to achieve this aim in practice .
I hope that the Commission will now accept these amendments .
Amendment No 20 :
In this context , the amendment refers to Article 14 of the Berne Convention .
The recommendation for second reading made by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy of the European Parliament does not meet these criteria .
Our position , however , is that national prosecuting powers must not be affected by the creation of the post of European Public Prosecutor .
For this reason we can only partially accept Amendment No 16 .
The next issue , which also relates to the quotas , is the extension of the period of validity of the tariff-quotas regime .
May I deal finally with Amendments Nos 1 to 5 as well as 12 and 36 .
Consolidation is important , but so , too , is the right perspective .
The only instance in which no tax is levied is when the supplier is in a non-EU country and the recipient is in a Member State of the EU.
The idea of a European fiscal policy is not about levying Community taxes or harmonising tax regimes .
It is high time the Commission gathered the various VAT directives into a single regulation so that the VAT regime can at least be uniformly applied .
It surely cannot be our intention in adopting new taxes , so-called Euro-taxes , to accelerate this downward spiral in our countries .
We are , after all , anxious to ensure that no
