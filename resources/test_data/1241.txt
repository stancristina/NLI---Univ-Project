Mr President , I was one of those who fought to extend duty-free .
And we are talking of 2 , 500 employees .
The power of the Taliban takes us back centuries , to the darkest years of the Middle Ages .
In Afghanistan , disobeying the authority of the extremists is tantamount to the death penalty .
Of course , such witnesses are never found .
After all that , it is no wonder that the Taliban reached the point of attacking the Bonino Commission , the Commission responsible for the humanitarian aid which the European Union provides for the people of Afghanistan .
To conclude , I would like to call on the Council of Ministers , the European Commission , the governments of Member States and the international organizations to stop all aid to Afghanistan , unless this aid goes directly to the nongovernmental organizations , and to undertake global action to resolve the political problems of Afghanistan through peaceful means , and to institute respect for human rights and democratic freedoms .
It makes the essential points and expresses , I think , the nature of our culture , which is the irreplaceable relationship with the written word .
We have examples of a very significant revival in many countries of the European Union , with new forms of support and commitment from readers and friends .
The question is whether it is worthwhile debating these issues at the level of the European Union and how we can help , without of course stifling the press and its freedom through our help .
I shall be brief , Mr President .
But it is also necessary and useful on our part to see how we can increase investments for the modernisation , for example , of the regional press .
Mr President , there is another issue .
This constitutes unfair competition as regards the absorption of advertising allocations , for example , where this directive is most aggressively violated .
Finally , Mr President , we can also help through the exchange of journalists and newspaper owners , through getting to know them and through them getting to know each other , and through supporting forms of collaboration for the production of different types of newspapers etc . on a Europe-wide level , and at the level of the European Union .
There is confusion .
Will he worry about balances and will he exercise self-regulation ?
The debate we are having today reminds me of former debates on our relationship with the environment , on our love for it and so on , when we discovered that some people were making money , and indeed a great deal of money , from the destruction of the environment .
There is something new .
There is also the problem of ratification , as , by analogy , could be said in any state of law .
Here is an issue which goes far beyond our debate , but which , and I would like to emphasise this , Madam President , emerges every time we discuss new problems of this kind .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mr Schulz on his proposal of a legal system for the protection of children from child prostitution , child sex tourism and exploitation .
Things have changed .
Is this the world that we are going to bequeath to our children ?
Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the Commissioner , Mr Papoutsis , on the sensitivity and speed with which he responded to the desire of all of us to have a document so that we could begin debating this burning issue , which is of concern to thousands of citizens in the countries of Europe and across the globe alike .
The poverty which blights many regions of our planet is the prime cause of the promotion of child sex abuse and child sex tourism .
This punishment in society will come about through revealing the acts of men who wish to be regarded as honourable in their own countries , in their families , and in their own surroundings .
As a precondition to our beginning to resolve the issue , there must be the political will of citizens both here and in our own countries to grapple with this den of vice , which is extremely powerful both economically , socially and politically .
More specifically , while it is true that it makes a clear distinction between small fishing communities and large commercial and industrial activity and while it is also true that it asks for positive measures to be targeted at small coastal fishing fleets , it contains an enormous discrepancy : the common fisheries policy for the Atlantic , the North Sea and the Mediterranean .
But , however powerful the incentives may be , they do not solve the problem .
Will they just go to swell the ranks of the millions of people already out of work ?
However , in the Commission proposal two thirds of the programme budget are allocated to the continuation of Altener I. What is more , the 30 million proposed by the Commission for the first two years of Altener II are , by common consent and in the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy , insufficient for a programme with such ambitious aims .
The Commission must , in the future , outline a concrete strategy to enable renewable energy sources to penetrate the free market , and elaborate a detailed investment plan with concrete proposals for economic measures to promote these energy sources .
We are hopeful that these points will be covered by the White Paper
