a way that is closely consistent with the recommendations of the Committee of Experts .
That service will open on 1 May this year .
It will be headed by a professionally qualified member of the audit profession and its independence must and will be guaranteed through a new provision to be added in the financial regulation .
The new service will report to me and it will be accompanied by an Audit Progress Board chaired by my colleague , Mrs Schreyer , who I am delighted to see in the Chamber this evening .
As Budgets Commissioner , here responsibilities already include relations with the Court of Auditors .
This Audit Progress Board will ensure effective and rigorous follow-up to internal audits .
I want to emphasise strongly that changing our control systems will definitely not mean relaxing them .
The proposed change will make the systems more effective , both in terms of inputs and in terms of measured and accountable outcomes .
I can also specifically assure the House that we are not going for what is sometimes called " a big bang approach " .
Financial control ' s ex ante visa for each spending department will only be relinquished as and when the internal control system in a department is shown to be fully adequate .
I am somewhat surprised that paragraph 10 of the draft resolution does not appear to address the fundamental criticisms of the current centralised financial control function made in both reports of the Committee of Independent Experts .
That committee was very clear about the need to abolish the centralised ex ante visa .
It was clear too on the need to separate internal audit from financial control .
In addition , I do not believe that paragraph 10 fully reflects the opinion of the Court of Auditors in 1997 .
Naturally the Court will be able to give its considered opinion on the proposed changes to the Financial Regulation but it is useful to recall Mr Karlsson ' s comments to this House last month .
" The Commission 's internal control " he said "is not forceful enough in preventing incorrect operation .
For instance , the Financial Controller granted a positive a priori visa in most of the cases of mismanagement or irregularities recently uncovered .
At the same time , the internal audit function is carried out in an uncoordinated way by several bodies , notably the same Financial Controller , the Inspectorate General and by some units operating Directorates-General . "
The centralised ex ante approval system was doubtlessly originally designed to ensure carefulness but , over the years , it has had the perverse effect of reducing the extent to which managers feel responsible for their decisions .
I do not believe that there is any real disagreement between us on this .
I take it from paragraph 10 that the underlying preoccupation of honourable Members is that there should be a carefully managed transition .
That will most certainly be the character of the change as honourable Members will see when they read the reform strategy document .
Our objective , the committee ' s objective , the Court of Auditors ' objective is not to abolish financial control , it is to get rid of and improve upon centralised financial control .
Before leaving this area I would add that we agree with the rapporteur that the existing internal audit function must be maintained pending the establishment of the new independent internal audit service in a matter of months .
Turning quickly to the section of the resolution on fighting fraud , corruption , mismanagement and nepotism : the major new proposal of the report concerns reporting by Commission officials of perceived wrong-doing .
As I made clear in the hearings last September and on other occasions , we are at one in the belief that there is value in defining the best possible mechanisms for this purpose although obviously we all hope that it will rarely be needed .
Since June of last year , the OLAF regulation has given better guidance to staff about reporting possible irregularities .
We propose to complement those provisions by defining the rights and obligations for officials to report suspected wrong-doing through internal channels but not exclusively within the same hierarchical line .
The possibility of using specified external channels will also be addressed .
We are seeking to implement best practice .
Serious response to reports , confidentiality at early stages and career protection will be assured for people who report wrong-doing in good faith and in ways that do not compromise investigations by untimely disclosure .
As a corollary , there will be safeguards for officials who are the subject of false allegations .
A communication later this year will give full details .
I do not think Parliament will be disappointed by what we will propose .
I am persuaded , however , by the suggestion in paragraph 34 of the report on using external bodies to enforce existing provisions on financial liability .
We already plan to reform the existing disciplinary procedures to ensure thoroughness , fairness , consistency and professionalism .
And we will propose the establishment of an interinstitutional Disciplinary Board - something else on which we will need the support and understanding of Parliament .
A communication in June will set out the full proposal for change .
Standards in public life is the next main section of the report before the House .
With the introduction of a series of codes of conduct the current Commission has begun to develop an explicit ethical framework .
This will be taken a step further with a proposal in June for an interinstitutional agreement on a committee on standards in public life .
That is in line with the draft resolution .
An important role for the committee will be to give advice on ethics and standards and to supervise common and separate codes of conduct for the institutions
