been news of the Croatian parliament’s ratification of the agreement on the distribution of the assets of the succession countries of the former Yugoslavia , an agreement signed in Vienna in 2001 , but until now only signed by the Croatians .
Within this legally defined framework , it will therefore be easier to resolve other problems , not least that of the Croatian unilateral declaration on the exclusive Adriatic maritime environmental zone , criticised by the European Union too for being unilateral and not achieved through an agreement between all those concerned .
Firstly : the issue of children in institutions and the issue of adoption .
Rigour is of course needed , but so too is understanding of the efforts made and the results achieved .
It is important that our family extends to Romania , a country that needs the European Union and that needs and , in certain sectors , also wants democracy despite the existing problems .
TENs were first defined in 1996 , whereupon we found ourselves , little by little , having to look again at this project several times , changing the content too , because motorways of the sea are fundamentally a novelty that must above all be seen as a tool for allowing some traffic to be taken away from our Union’s congested roads .
This is , however , an objection that , in my opinion , can be easily overcome only if there is a will to suggest access to the EIB funds or a more prudent reworking of the funds already earmarked by the European Union for the whole Balkan area .
In Sicily , trains still run on single tracks , like in the time of King Vittorio Emmanuele .
Political responsibility therefore falls to the Council .
The water , or water services , sector is , and will be , crucial in Europe too .
According to figures contained in the European Commission ’s latest report on the health situation , the number of elderly people over the age of 75 will rise to 27 % by 2010 .
Even though the provision of health care and care in general currently remains essentially the competence of the Member States , we realise that a similar trend with significant and complex implications cannot be dealt with effectively and thoroughly at national level alone .
This seems a rather unwise decision , also in terms of the attempt to make it a world day .
The bridge over the Strait of Messina , an addition to the North-South rail route – only proposed at the request of the Italian Government , though never subject to environmental impact assessments , as the former Commissioner Mr Van Miert admitted to the Members of this Parliament – has been crossed off the list of projects of European interest .
All this is detrimental to alternative projects that provided for taking Corridor 5 beyond the Alps , thus cutting off our regions and our businesses from the Eastern markets .     .
Whilst possible infringement proceedings are underway against the Italian State , it seems that Commissioner Bolkestein directly agreed to a solution with the Governor of the Province of Bolzano , as the President himself announced after returning from a trip to Brussels .
Competition will , therefore , encourage innovation and efficiency .
To conclude , Madam President , I announce that the radical Members of the Lista Bonino will vote in favour of this compromise .     Madam President , I thank the rapporteur for the work carried out and for the excellent proposal for a resolution that she drew up , a proposal with which I fully agree .
Now we are all used to buying return air tickets simply because they often cost less than single tickets .
It is wrong and dangerous , even to effectively combat terrorism , to depend on the arbitrary collection of data that were not specifically selected for security purposes , and it is unfair not to provide for quick and effective instruments to guarantee the rectification of incorrect data for those concerned .
Of course , today we are in a weak position because we were already in a weak position when we entered negotiations .
This is no way to build an antiterrorist Europe !     Mr President , frankly I must say that , emotionally speaking , my speech will be different from one that I would have made before 11 March 2004 , that is to say before the tragic events that took place in Spain .
The purposes are known : this is about combating terrorism ; and – quite truthfully – doubts are being alleviated , at least as far as I am concerned , and I am also managing to overcome my doubts about the number of agencies that have access to the data , about the fact that an immediate access system is used , about the absence of appeal procedures and many other aspects .
Lastly , we should have liked to underline more strongly the fact that we consider it essential that regulations approved in the Community should be equally valid in all the Member States ; it would therefore be appropriate to restrict the possibility of approving changes and to authorise them only to give greater protection to an individual country ’s traditional products , without ever relaxing food standards and safety .
If we consider the five freedoms mentioned in the Bremmer report in 1995 , we realise that the unloading , loading and moving operations will have a profound effect on each of these five freedoms .
First of all , the maximum length of time spent on the road : given that livestock should be moved as little as possible , it would be appropriate to limit transport to eight hours or 500 km per day at most
