The entire process must take place with the greatest possible openness .
I believe that it is correct and important for us to be able to conduct a broader debate on the future of Europe .
In this work I really look forward to the contribution of Parliament as it is you Members who have direct contact with your voters around Europe .
Let me first say that the community method , which has played such an important role in European cooperation , must naturally retain a strong position in the future too , even if , in some areas , we supplement it with the new open coordination method .
I can see both advantages and disadvantages in the 'convention method ' which several players have suggested as an important or possible model for debate .
I look forward to being involved in the debate next week .
Every country will naturally conduct a national debate in the light of its own traditions and conditions .
The Swedish and the Belgian Presidencies , Parliament and the Commission will share the main responsibility for this first phase , which demands close and trusting cooperation .
The European Council will then adopt a view on the continued process at the meeting in Laeken/Brussels in December .
It will be built through concrete achievements .
It is important to remember this even today .
I now look forward to hearing the visions of the Members of Parliament on the future of Europe .
Of course , this figure could have been considerably higher , but this is a good start .
However , it is important that we tell people today how these points of view will be used and channelled so that we really do achieve a broad debate rather than just empty words .
I am therefore also sceptical regarding the convention method .
Instead , discussion should centre upon democratic reform of the European Union , providing full insight into the legislative work and reducing the power of civil servants , especially within the Commission .
It is impossible to understand how one can cold-bloodedly build a future conflict between large and small countries into the treaty .
We want to see higher ambitions when it comes to reaching decisions on who is to do what , who is to decide what and how , and on rights and democracy .
This is tantamount to shirking its responsibility to lead Europe .
I seem to have noticed that Mr Poettering , Mr Barón Crespo , Mr Cox and others who have taken part in the debate are still in favour of a broad political debate on issues of both content and form , and I think this is good .
Naturally , we also need to carry the Member States with us and agree on this .
Then there is the major question of the next Intergovernmental Conference .
I understand that Parliament is very interested , as I am , in the important discussion on how we will reach a decision - the debate we will have before the decision , how we will prepare for the debate , and the role which might be played by the convention method .
Who is to be involved - Member States , candidate countries and organisations , and if so , which ?
Furthermore , the decision-making process itself can be unclear , as the convention submits proposals and the Intergovernmental Conference has to reach decisions .
We have said that we must now be able to discuss both the factual issues surrounding the future of Europe and the methods - including the question of a convention .
I do not know exactly where Mr Elles has been looking , but I can guarantee that Parliament is represented .
Let me now comment on some other issues .
I myself have taken the debate to many Swedish schools .
I would also like to say to Mr Barón Crespo that of course Parliament was invited to take part in launching the future of Europe right from the start .
We are also working on town twinning to a great extent and are doing a great deal of work at many schools and universities .
Among other things in my introductory speech , I quoted contributions from Denmark and the UK - opinions of ordinary citizens in both countries .
So when it comes to the future of Europe , let us discuss both methods and substance .
The greatest change is naturally expansion - the EU is now forging a path for the historic reunification of Europe .
It is about quality of work and lifelong learning .
Having a job and being able to earn a living creates a feeling of participation , security and dignity , while unemployment leads to uncertainty , exclusion and xenophobia .
All these areas are dependent on each other if the Union is to achieve its high targets by 2010 : creating the world ' s leading knowledge-based economy , creating 20 million new jobs and combining competitiveness and greater social cohesion .
We must not undermine this process by adding far too many new questions .
We should consider setting up targets for as early as 2005 and add special targets for the employment of the elderly , a group with enormous potential - only 38 % of those aged 55 - 64 are currently in work .
We will seek to confirm the central role of lifelong learning , both for individual development and for European competitiveness , and invite the Commission to also draw up objectives for lifelong learning .
We hope that agreement on this will be achieved at the summit .
It means lower prices and a wider range and better quality of goods and services .
We therefore need a wider-ranging overview of pension systems and a discussion of the design of childcare and possibly also health care and care of the elderly .
We want to develop the opportunity for
