the Swoboda report will be used not for the economic and social development of Turkey , but to support the repressive mechanisms of the Turkish state , which recently demonstrated what it is capable of by barbarically attacking the prisons , killing dozens of political prisoners on hunger strike , and by imprisoning and maltreating even children .
Mr President , in my opinion , Turkey has a place in Europe , for both geographical and historical reasons , and no one can stop it from taking its rightful place , along with its culture , history and religion .
This distinguishes it from the other candidate countries .
Just yesterday we were talking with Mr Verheugen about 12-year-old children who are in prison because they belong to the PKK , about Leyla Zana , who received the Sakharov prize and who is in prison .
So let Turkey take a step on the Cyprus issue , on the Kurdish question and on human rights before we go down this line .
However , to be perfectly honest , I am beginning to wonder if Turkey wants the same thing .
And , secondly , to the hard line stance taken by the Turkish-Cypriot leader Denktash , who is refusing to sit down to inter-community talks and who is being encouraged in this stance by Turkey .
The first reason is that the budget for these programmes has already been decided .
May I remind the House that Turkey also benefits from the MEDA programme .
I should like to comment , in particular , on the importance of the knowledge economy and of investments in human resources as a basic element of European policy .
We also need to ensure that suitable information networks are created , to which all citizens have access , without exclusion and without a cost barrier .
However , measures must also be taken to avoid the obvious danger of information poverty .
The debate illustrated the considerable risks from GMOs without throwing up any definitive or persuasive arguments to the contrary .
Even the Council 's common position was adopted despite the fact that Member States such as France , Italy and Denmark stated that they felt that a new five-year moratorium was needed .
It is for these reasons that we are unable to vote in favour of the common position on the new directive on GMOs .
Its success is , of course , the single currency ; its failure is that we have still been unable to mop up unemployment and achieve full employment .
What we wonder is why , despite our success with the one , we cannot achieve the same degree of success with the other .
Not even in Latin America or Asia or the whole of America do these three factors exist side by side .
However , I am not convinced that we are making proper use of our experience in the real economy .
We must not forget that the aim of squeezing inflation took absolute priority and , in my personal estimate , even worked to the detriment of employment .
This combination has the additional advantage of indirectly resolving - en passant , as they say in chess - the second major objective of technological progress .
And the rapporteur 's ambitious efforts notwithstanding , I should like to point out that increasing the number of quantitative indicators does not lead us into dead-end street , because we may find ourselves in a position where , to quote the Bible , someone one day says to the Commission : Ìartha , Ìartha , thou art careful , and troubled about many things · ( The President cut the speaker off )
They are using groundless arguments , such as longer life expectancy and the allegedly excessive cost of labour , in order to introduce measures such as increasing the retirement age , reducing employers ' contributions and replacing insurance funds by private , profit-making companies .
Similar action is being taken in other countries .
I tabled a question to the Council for February 's Question Time on " the responsibilities of Mr Solana and the Balkan syndrome " under Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure .
Similarly , question no . 7 by Mr Nogueira Román states : " In view of the reprehensible inertia of the Spanish authorities , what steps has the Council taken to put an end to this tragic situation ? "
The fact , as other members have said , that carriers often save human lives , by helping people to escape from persecution by totalitarian regimes , and provide services to refugees protected by the Geneva Convention and desperate people who have nowhere else to turn , is often passed over in silence .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , despite the contradictions and repetitions contained in the final version of the report produced by the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , it is still possible to discern the guideline which it wishes to lay down for research for the benefit of the monopolies .
In addition , the reference to new Member States , paragraph 35 , is clearly disparaging , given that most of them have a long history of research .

The Community needs 4.5 million tonnes of unginned cotton .
However , instead of strengthening the current regulation , as rightly demanded by our cotton growers , by bringing quotas into line with current production levels and adjusting at least some of the institutional prices , which have been frozen since 1992 , along comes the European Commission and not only does it propose to keep support at its current low levels , it increases the coresponsibility levy by 20 % .
Since then , international prices have doubled .
