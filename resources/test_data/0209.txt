's criticisms , but not all .
In general any such appeal must have suspensive effect , unless a request for asylum has been refused because it is manifestly unfounded .
It is thus important for us to have developed an initiative in this House which seeks to achieve one .
Because , as we see of course every day in our papers , the majority of asylum-seekers and refugees are outside Europe and are accepted or rejected outside Europe .
I do not think that is the case , although as parliamentarians we are of course malcontents by nature , especially when we are in opposition and we are all in opposition .
But it is apparent in practice , and the report makes the point , that this concept is at odds with a concept which is sacred in refugee law , namely the right of non-refoulement .
If that is so , one has a duty , Mr Deprez , you too , to reconsider such concepts and not only do I do that , fortunately so does Mr Wiebenga who formerly as a member of his national parliament embraced that kind of concept and who now , like myself , views the matter with a degree of detachment and is prepared to reconsider it on the basis of practical experience .
That is why I tabled it again before the plenary .
Those dangers must be contained by policy , or at least a case-by-case assessment is needed of the kind now being conducted over soya beans .
And if the consumer , for whatever reason , does not want this transgenic soya , or products of it , that preference must be accommodated .
Nor do I agree with point 8 about labelling .
There is uncertainty over possible allergic reactions and over health generally .
As we have already seen , the pesticide Roundup , to which the new soya is resistant , certainly kills a lot of weeds , but it has been found in Australia that it also leads to resistant weed species which then have to be controlled in turn using different agents again .
How far are we prepared to go in the further development and increased use of fertile land to produce a dominant product of this kind ?
I should first of all like to express my sincere appreciation for the speed with which the White Paper was written .
That means that the principle of subsidiarity has been better implemented , which prevents the Union 's energy policy from becoming centralised .
Investment in renewable energy should be made financially attractive .
The Commission must coordinate , bring partners together , match financial efforts and promote regional cooperation .
And although the rapporteur , I was pleased to hear , called this morning for more money to be spent on research into renewable sources of energy , the White Paper and the report mention nuclear energy as a necessary option .
That ignores the fact that these countries often possess relatively clean fossil fuels such s gas .
What I find missing in the Van Velzen report is a breakdown of the real costs of waste and of the power stations .
Mrs Schierhuber has illustrated the problem here in exemplary fashion .
How can that be ?
I must admit to a certain surprise on the only dissenting voice I have heard in this House , which was from the Liberal Group .
I do not think he was listening properly to our comments for we expressed no criticism of him .
While we are speaking here and now there is one horse dying as a result of this inhumane treatment .
Does the Commissioner still believe that the 1995 directive can still come into effect on 1 January 1997 ?
He weighed 38 kilos when he escaped from prison during the 1956 Hungarian uprising and fled to the Netherlands .
For fourteen years after that he worked day and night to bring the perpetrators of those crimes to justice .
Because if we are not careful we shall soon find ourselves with no accused and no finances before the tribunal .
In my own country of Belgium they have still not managed to date to wipe out by means of a legal amnesty the divisions of the Second World War .
I hope that at long last we have learned our lesson with the impasse reached in the negotiations with Senegal , the reasons for which have been explained by Mrs PÃ©ry .
We cannot have that on our conscience .
For the first time it is saying clearly that for the sake of the future of the country and for all the 269 , 000 people there dependent directly or indirectly on fishing there must be agreements which appear to work for the benefit of all and not for the interests of a small group .
Where we have had to make restrictions , such restrictions should also apply to a number of African countries .
Perhaps that could be considered .
Pressure must continue to be exerted in order to put an end to the violent suppression of the people of Nigeria , and we must do everything possible to enable the democratic forces in this major African country to work towards rebuilding the country .
There is just one point I want to make .
We should really be grateful that a multinational is reacting to the actions being taken .
The democratic and human rights organisations deserve our support and the report that I myself am writing on the future strategy for Latin America will also draw attention to this country where peace has broken out , in the hope that peace is also lasting .
If the Commissioner is to be understood to mean that Mr Bangemann will accept Parliament 's amendment in the next conciliation then we welcome it
