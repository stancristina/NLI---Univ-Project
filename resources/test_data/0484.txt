, we are not strong enough or courageous enough to impose certain choices on those who stand to benefit from pension systems not changing in due time .
We have systems which are financially unsustainable , whose treatment of the younger and future generations is wicked , and yet we cannot muster the political will to change the situation .
The pensions dialogue with the people filling the squares in Vienna , Paris or Rome , where the people 's fear is exploited with demagogic proposals when they know full well that something needs to be done , is a sterile dialogue , a dialogue that can lead nowhere .
I could not fail to vote for the report , so that education can be provided and poverty reduced in developing countries .
We must act .
The report records both unlawful funding of the militia and unlawful exploitation of gold , diamonds , oil and coltan .
The 20 000 prisoners released were common criminals , while the political prisoners are still being detained .
I would stress what Mr Bar√≥n Crespo said , namely that this does not mean there would be any less need for a more in-depth analysis after the Thessaloniki Summit , carried out according to whatever procedure Parliament decides to follow .
Mr President , on Wednesday 21 May 2003 , I was sent as a European Parliament delegate to the United Nations in New York to speak at the Permanent Forum of indigenous peoples from all over the world , which meets once a year in the UN headquarters .
It is intolerable that they continue to be denied the same rights as national members of parliament , such as the right to visit prisons and other rights related to the electoral mandate to represent the European people .
I too want to stress that it really is a Statute for a genuine Parliament , which covers not just the financial side of things and , if I may be so bold as to mention it , remuneration , which were fairly minor issues on which the debate in committee had reached an impasse , but the structure and organisation of Parliament 's function , role , characteristics and mandate as well .
Mr President , without wishing to detract from the huge accomplishment of our fellow Members , this is a subject on which there will never be an end to analysis and debate .
Therefore , we would support the raft of directives only if this were achieved by means of phasing-in the market mechanisms , for the cross border regulation cannot produce identical positive effects for the end consumers of the Member States when there are disparities in trade flows .
I would like to focus on a number of political requirements which go hand in hand with the action programme .
I feel it is too easy to reach agreement on objectives of this kind .
I would also like to thank the rapporteur , for I feel that he has endeavoured in a short space of time to take into account all the different viewpoints in the House , without compromising on quality objectives .
Matters can be improved by providing training for women and the services necessary to make the market favourable to female employment .
The amendments adopted in committee are along these lines .
The task of the European ruling class , and the European Parliament in particular , is to rewrite the model of the social market economy , to modernise it , to revise it without reducing the social undertaking .
When applying flexibility , care must be taken to ensure that it does not become an easy option for certain companies which would like to exploit this solution by creating atypical jobs such as collaboration contracts , which do not represent a secure future , especially for young people .
To quote the resolution adopted by Parliament in December 2001 , any agreement on judicial and police cooperation signed by the European Union must respect the Convention on Human Rights .
My opinion is that some views are to be considered to be decidedly partisan .
I put the question to the House .
I had no hope of succeeding and so I had to resign myself to voting for the motion : it is better to be half a judge than to be a nobody .
The Commission advocates greater price competitiveness , but also respect for the demands of society , in other words , sustainability and quality .
Secondly , the European market will be strongly influenced by the main world exporters , which , in our view , will certainly not be the developing countries .
With a view to increasing employment , Member States must be given the tangible possibility of making employment a criterion in allocating a quota of the direct aid provided under the first pillar .
We will firmly support all the genuinely important amendments which , like those tabled by our group , seek to establish a system of special benefits for young farmers with a view to facilitating access for new generations to production activities .
CAP reform cannot be based on the interests of farmers ; the focus must be on the interests of the European Union , on the interests of all the citizens and all the consumers who are paying 70 % more for milk than they would on an open market free of subsidies ; who are paying 220 % more for meat while their Argentine cousins are starving to death or , if not dying , are suffering the effects of an economic recession because we are preventing them from exporting their meat to Europe ; who are paying 90 % more for sugar while Mozambique is unable to achieve economic recovery because of European protectionism .
