If we are dissatisfied with the laws , we can choose new representatives and obtain new laws .
They are taking legislative power from our 15 national parliaments and transferring it to officials and ministers , from voters and elected representatives to the executive and from open assemblies to meetings behind closed doors in Brussels .
Electoral power is being transferred from our constitutions , but is not being transferred to the European Parliament .
We parliamentarians have been side-tracked .
The EU is not a parliamentary democracy , and the national parliaments have been still further marginalised .
We call the initiative SOS Democracy - " SOS" because it is a matter of urgency and " Democracy " because that is the heart of the problem .
We should like to have it in tomorrow ' s .
We have support across the political spectrum from communists to conservatives .
The voters in our countries should always have the last word .
Join us in SOS Democracy .
Mr President , I would thank the rapporteur for a report that the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party can fully support .
The subject I want to bring up is that of women ' s involvement in the reconstruction programme , and I wish to do so because women and children have always been the major victims when it comes to conflicts , civil wars and wars generally .
I think it is absolutely crucial , if cultural understanding is to be promoted and a proper reconstruction programme prepared , that women should be involved - and involved very centrally - in the processes concerned .
It is in fact the case that a gender task force has been established under working party 1 , but this has not happened because of any initiative from above but because of an initiative from below when a number of women have - if I may put it like this - approached the conference table and asked if it were not unreasonable for them , in one way or another , to have a central place in the whole of the reconstruction work .
The initiative is also , of course , about getting women to stand at elections at local , regional and national levels .
Otherwise , these will not happen .
I would therefore ask both the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council to take care to ensure that , where future work is concerned , women are involved in the reconstruction processes .
I do not , in fact , believe that the project will succeed if that does not happen .
We agree , however , that this is the result of a policy which has been pursued up until now , that is to say a result of what has happened .
What is the basic idea behind setting up a 60 000-strong rapid reaction force when we all agree that a number of other initiatives are presumably required if there is a desire to solve conflicts in Europe and in neighbouring countries ?
Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Graça Moura for a splendid piece of work and for the energy he has put into drawing up this report .
The Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party is very happy to support initiatives which may create greater awareness of the value of linguistic diversity in the European Union .
A knowledge of languages is important , for European languages are of great significance to European culture and civilisation , and people need good language skills in order to be able to find employment in EU countries other than their own .
Mr Graça Moura' s proposal includes the 11 official EU languages , together with a number of other languages recognised by the Member States , including Irish and Luxembourgish .
The Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party also thinks that the programme should include other languages which are actually used in the various Member States , for instance Catalan in Spain and Frisian in the Netherlands .
Finally , in the programme for the European Year of Languages , consideration is also given to the forthcoming enlargement of the Union , something which we in the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party consider to be crucial to all EU programmes .
I should also like to thank the Council and the Commission for contributing to our at long last achieving a good result .
The strength of the programme is , of course , that , by means of cross-national exchanges , it encourages young people to contribute actively to further European integration .
I also think that the programme will ensure that the fundamental values upon which the European Union is founded will continue to be propagated .
Finally , the Community ' s action programme for youth also gives consideration to the forthcoming enlargement of the Union , something which we in the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party believe to be of crucial importance to all EU programmes .
We had a problem when we had to prepare the voting list , which was that we could not find the amendment tabled by the Greens , the Group of the European People ' s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party for point 5 .
I do not know whether it is possible to have it read out so that we have the chance to adopt a position on it .
