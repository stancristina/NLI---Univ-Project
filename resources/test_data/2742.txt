We sincerely regret this , for such a policy would have represented the first step towards controlling immigration , inasmuch as being able to count and monitor is a necessary precondition of implementing quotas .
Ten per cent of them , that is to say 15 million people , have no jobs .
We reject the ‘basic choices ’ described by this report and to be implemented not in the interests of the people but in opposition to those interests .     The report that has been presented concerning a common European security policy is supposed to advocate a transparent policy , based upon multilateralism and a global approach to security that is not purely military .
It even adds good proposals , such as the proposal to declare Jerusalem part of the ‘cultural and religious heritage of mankind’ , the dual capital of Israel and of the future Palestinian state , with an international statute respecting all the religions ( paragraph 53 ) .
Yet , in ‘real life’ , it is in fact large companies ’ attempts to maximise their profits that crush small subcontractors .
Others have ‘delocalised ’ their production to Central Europe , and they sometimes subsequently transfer it to still poorer countries , sowing devastation behind them .
What is more serious is the fact that , encased as it is in the straitjacket of a Stability Pact that , in calculating the public debt , draws no distinction between productive investment and non-productive expenditure , and subject as it is , when it comes to state aid think of the Alstom affair and to concentrations between companies , to control by the Commission that is as rigorous as it is abstract , our companies manifestly do not have the means to compete effectively with US industry which , for its part , benefits from permanent government support .
We agree with the industry that the inspection procedures should be harmonised .
As regards the issue of shrimps , raised by Mr Maat , we will certainly take note of this issue and there is no doubt that Mr Fischler will talk to his colleagues about it and , if necessary , to Mr Monti .     .

Rather than improving the fate of the local population , these riches are the cause of its misfortune .
Therefore , in our view , support for the peace process and a substantial contribution to the reconstruction of the country are the two objectives that the Union must continue to strive towards in order to support the little progress being made as regards the peace process in that country , which sadly continues to be troubled .     .
We abstained on this report , as on the other two fisheries reports .
There is a social and humanitarian problem because this project , which is under way , means that a population of 2 000 people has to be resettled and 900 houses demolished ; and there is an environmental problem because this project will , in particular , involve the installation of a 400-hectare settling tank containing cyanide residue , necessary for the intensive treatment of ore .
Or , does this awkwardness on the part of the Commission not reveal a fundamental methodological error which has not allowed the specific characteristics of each country to be properly taken into consideration in the enlargement process and which is in danger of having long-term consequences ?     .
As we know , not only has it been useful but it is also fully usable .
The important thing – for times are going to change , for European and world society are going to change – is the ability to adapt these policies to the Union’s needs , to the needs of society as they change .
All I want at this juncture is to see some of this European spirit hovering once again over the work of the Intergovernmental Conference .

For this Parliament , the essential thing now is to preserve the balance that has been achieved within the Convention .
In particular , 10 % of the budget for this programme is to be allocated to the conservation and sustainable management of natural resources , and 35 % to social and health infrastructures .
Those seven proposals , covering seven different areas , were accompanied by a communication from Mrs Schreyer setting out the common context which justified their presentation and the essential elements used to ensure a similar response , between one proposal and another , to the common problems facing these sectors of activity .
We note that the length of the programmes – five years for culture and education , and three years for youth – has met with mixed reactions .
A certain number of amendments have this in mind , and want Parliament to be informed in advance about the content of any invitations to submit proposals , before they are published by the Commission , or about the principle , the detailed implementing rules , or the composition of a jury .
In addition , the Commission sees itself in the role of cultural ambassador , as proposed in Amendment 9 on culture .
It also allows us to finance – and I shall not read the whole list , Mr President – the orchestras , the Chorale Academy , Europa Cantate , the Yehudi Menuhin Foundation , the Youth Academy Foundation , Europa Nostra , the Artists ’ Villages , Europalia , Euroballet , the Pegasus Foundation , the Boniface Memorial Foundation , and
