the liberalisation of water and other sensitive sectors in return for countries ’ being well treated .
I can lend you a few fair-trade clothes made from environmentally friendly materials so that , one day , you can take part incognito , as an ordinary delegate , and genuinely experience the atmosphere there , without the interference of security guards .
If people are to dare to make use of the four freedoms , we must also have rules governing the security not only of goods and capital but also of individuals .
Only then shall we be able to talk about confidence and trust .     Mr President , the common legal area is based upon mutual recognition .
I turn now to the exchange of information , which is a more sensitive area .
Thirdly : in addition to the Member States’ being informed of how the information is used , the individual too must be told what information has been given out .
I wish to thank him for the efforts he has already made in the area of data storage and believe that these will also bear fruit in the area of data exchange .     Mr President , first of all , might I be permitted to express my appreciation of Mr Evans’s reports and its conclusions ?
Such competition releases considerable dynamism and energy into European society , and not only where development , growth and new jobs are concerned .
It is not only a matter of economics , but also of European cooperation in its most practical sense .
I should also like to draw the Commissioner’s attention to that part of the report that deals with the importance of also creating sound conditions for European manufacturers to compete globally and with the importance of the need , when making competition assessments , to consider the whole of the internal market and not only national and local sub-markets .
I would , however , advise against urgent procedure .
It is a nice idea , that of exporting old fishing vessels , but it would not work very well .
These matters must firstly be investigated .
In order to obtain a proposal that works and that is just what is needed , usual procedures should be used so that local considerations can better be put into the equation .
We would risk reducing the boost given to households by low interest rates , and we should weaken that basic condition for long-term growth also formed by low interest rates .
It is unfortunate that the Socialist Group in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs chose to abstain when we voted on Mr Goebbels ’ report .
This requires changes in terms of enterprise , research and the internal market .
That is our task , the goals being higher growth , more jobs and the best wages in Europe .     Mr President , growth in the EU is clearly below what it potentially could be .
One cause of the unduly restrictive policy is the way in which the Stability and Growth Pact has been designed .
A country with a debt ratio of less than 60 % of GDP and which keeps inflation below 2 % will have a decreasing debt ratio if its economy grows in real terms by one percentage point or more and if the budget deficit amounts to 3 % .
The increase in debt would be stable and therefore defensible in the long term .
Because a debt ratio of 60 % of GDP is reasonable in economic terms , there is no reason to force such a financial restriction upon the country .
In this way , the whole of the EU would be given a boost .
I recommend that the Stability and Growth Pact be altered along these lines .     Mr President , firstly , I should like to say how sorry I am that the representative of the Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , Mr Hökmark , has left the debate .
What we need is more people in work , not a general increase in working time .
Thirdly , we need a balance in the Lisbon Process .
In the national debate at home , they do not talk about tax reductions or an increase in working time .
It would be regrettable if the PPE-DE Group were to adopt this neo-liberal policy and make it its own .
We cannot support paragraph 1 f , indent 2 , which recommends to the Council that it go some way towards harmonising national legislation governing the gathering and assessment of evidence .
What is more , it is doubtful whether there is any legal basis at all , be it in current treaties or in the forthcoming Constitution , for harmonisation in this respect .     Strengthening mutual trust in decisions by European courts by setting up an evaluation system may appear commendable , even if there now already exists a common framework of reference for the Member States in terms of the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and the case law of the European Court of Justice , which lays down minimum standards governing the right to trial by the courts .
The EU is , and must remain , a mosaic of minorities and cultures .
The matter of cultural capitals is one that individual cities and states should cooperate on and decide about without the EU’s interference .
In this situation , there is no reason for hurrying through a decision concerning future cultural capitals .
It is so good , even , that it can be funded in a host of other ways , for example through local sponsorship .
Aid for public activity should , as a matter of principle , also be accounted for and be easily accessible .
