It is remarkable that such a thing can be said in 2006 .     Mr President , I too wish to thank Mrs Doyle for taking such a heroic stance in this Assembly .
For example , why are we not banning fluorinated greenhouse gases in the refrigerators sold to consumers ?
The only way of obtaining an alternative is , of course , to set a time limit , whereupon research would come up with the right alternatives .
People’s legitimate anger , their anxiety and their political commitment are exploited in order to carry on the fight for a European superstate .
The 25 ladies and gentlemen of the European Council do not have a clue how energy technology and politics will look in ten years ’ time .
The report emphasises constructive solutions such as the importance of disseminating knowledge about the victims of Nazism and Communism .
The report is based primarily on an attitude of apparent incomprehension faced with the low turnout in the 2004 European Parliament elections and the fact that the draft Constitution was voted down in referenda in France and the Netherlands .
The work in relation to local amateur sports clubs smacks of contempt for people .
I also support the rapporteur’s view that the programme should be accessible to everyone and not just be addressed to well-educated and privileged groups .
Financial resources from the European Union should not be necessary to this project’s survival .
All this is encouraging , unlike the EU legislation that is forced on people and that limits their democratic opportunities for active participation .
We are proud that Sweden is one of the three countries not to have introduced any transitional rules .
We regret that the Heads of State or Government decided to introduce transitional arrangements in the accession agreement with the ten new Member States .
We believe that this issue should be decided on by individual Member States at national level .
We also question the proposal to introduce a scheme for ‘the systematic monitoring of migration of workers within the EU’ and to provide the necessary funds for this purpose ( paragraph 11 ) .
All this is made clear in our motion for a resolution .
This is partly due to the relative social equality and relatively high degree of social protection in the country .
However , it is undermined by other policy areas too .
A topical and instructive example of this type of damaging protectionism is the EU’s recent imposition of duties on shoes from , for example , Vietnam .
This process really would lead to the world’s poor countries being given a better deal , an outcome that should be the main purpose of aid .     We observe that those countries that have robust animal protection legislation in order to guarantee good conditions for animals , to reduce the risk of infection spreading and thus also to reduce the risk of damage to people’s health have not been hit by reduced sales of chicken meat .
In the situation that has arisen we are , therefore , in favour of its being possible to provide financial compensation to affected breeders .     We are voting against the European Parliament’s amendments .
For how long should the planned economy be allowed to continue within the food industry ?
We do not therefore believe that this is an issue for the European Parliament .
We are voting against the resolution in its entirety .     The Left Party’s delegation to the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left firmly repudiates the Lukashenko regime and its crimes in violation of democratic and human rights .
We believe that the presidential election in Belarus infringed a number of fundamental principles underpinning democratic and fair elections .
What , however , is crucial to us is to protest against the infringements of democratic and human rights in Belarus .     The global fight against diseases and poverty is a very important issue demanding large-scale international commitment .
We are also opposed to the EU having influence on , and extending its powers in relation to , issues already dealt with by other international organisations .
At the same time as relatively large amounts are invested in conducting a development policy organised by the EU , new EU barriers to trade are added to existing ones , making it impossible for the world’s poor countries to enter the EU market with their products .
What is it that is happening there ?
How does that feel ?
So what is the government doing ?
The Commission is now already giving EUR 160 million and my own country SEK 330 million by way of aid .
Mr President , twenty years have passed since the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl .
Even in my own little corner of Europe , in the north of Sweden , the radioactive fallout had an impact over many years through the contamination of the natural world that it caused .
Over the last 20 years there have been very few new nuclear reactors built in Europe .
The Chernobyl disaster is a reminder of the risks of nuclear power .
To this should be added the fact that the issue of nuclear waste has still not been resolved .
Nuclear power has also proved to be a very expensive source of energy .
We are currently on the brink of an enormous change–over of energy sources .
Instead of this , we have before us a unique opportunity to develop durable , renewable ‘green alternatives’ .
More of the EU’s research money needs , then , to be spent on sources of renewable energy , and less on research into nuclear power , and the current EURATOM Treaty , which has been outdated for a number of years , needs to be repealed .
However , it is important not to forget the rest
