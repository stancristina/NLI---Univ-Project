On one hand judicial measures fall outside the Community dimension yet on the other we have the free movement of people from which criminals are also benefiting .
It is this concern for basic rights , freedoms and guarantees which has led us to support the deletion from the text of the phone tapping proposals .
.
Past experience with ratification of European Union conventions in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal matters is unfortunately disappointing .
Furthermore , requests can be made directly between the competent authorities without any need to go via central authorities .
At the present time it is entirely up to the Member States to ensure that those rights are respected under the scrutiny of the Council of Europe ' s Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg .
However , we must be realistic .
The Commission sincerely hopes that the European Parliament will support its efforts to make progress in these important fields .
We have established requirements for the countries which want to join our Union and we must also establish requirements for the countries which we support , because we believe in democracy and its values .
It is a repressive dictatorship .
These cases keep occurring .
There are two sides in Angola or rather two armed groups .
This war must be stopped .
This situation , as in neighbouring former Zaire , is like a festering wound in which it is not clear who is infecting whom .
It is clear that such a scenario will never allow peace to be established in Angola .
In recent years , the behaviour of UNITA has merited our reservations and criticisms but this cannot be used to excuse the Angolan State for having established a disastrous war economy with widespread corruption resulting in the continued suffering of its people .
A universal service offering high-quality postal services at affordable prices throughout the country forms the basis for the operation of the whole postal system and must lead to a uniform nationwide tariff .
Any change to the current situation must be preceded by a rigorous study of its various implications , with the objective always being to guarantee a high-quality public service and to retain the current public operators and existing jobs .
The scholars of ancient Greece bequeathed to us the assumption that there is a natural link between equality and justice .
Because the conditions are the same for everyone , it is in no one ' s interests to make the conditions more difficult for anyone else " .
To my mind , preventing women from fully exercising their rights as citizens is one of the determining factors in the crisis of democracy , which only an integrated policy on gender equality can help to reverse .
Whilst progress towards democracy being irreversibly established throughout the world appears to have become an accepted fact , we are discovering at the same time the extent of the social suffering caused by the effect of globalisation on the weakest sectors of society and therefore on women , as poverty insists on being a feminine word and on having a feminine face .
Under the Portuguese presidency , and bearing in mind the efforts and the contributions made by the various Member States , the Lisbon Special Summit , which will be held on the theme 'Employment , economic reform and social cohesion : towards a new Europe of innovation and knowledge ' , seeks to counter these risks , which have historically always been more serious for women , particularly in those areas most directly related to the specific theme proposed .
That is why the choice of today ' s subject shows such good judgement , as it will be a determining factor in the future , once equality is established in legal terms .
Given that real democracy presupposes and implies the equal participation of all citizens , on this evidence the difference between the sexes leads to a significant strengthening of the democratic system .
That is why I believe in parity , the new face of sexual equality , which gives universality back its true meaning and its rightful place in a politically organised society .
This is the position that the EU must adopt .
This proposal offers a new way of viewing public and private life ; it is designed to combat the public ' s suspicion of politicians and of their behaviour , an alternative designed to overcome distrust about the way in which democratic structures function and about their transparency .
So let us build that democracy !
The truth is that the scant participation of women in centres of political representation and decision making demonstrates a democratic deficit which is incompatible with genuine democracy .
We want this opportunity to bring substantial changes to our lives in society at large , we want democracy to be synonymous with equality between men and women , and we do not want women to be excluded socially or economically as is still happening today .
The Lisbon Summit to be held at the end of this month is very much geared towards women .
( PT ) Mr President , I am grateful for the liveliness of the debate on this issue , the ways in which it has been addressed and the positions adopted on it in this House .
To my mind , quotas will - as was stated here , moreover - be merely a provisional instrument .
Furthermore , it is difficult to take people off the final lists in cases where a certain personal fondness may be involved .
If they approve these laws , it is because this process is about consensus , not imposition , nor is it a battle of the sexes .
At the moment , we are not taking advantage of women ' s dignity , usefulness , competence , their
