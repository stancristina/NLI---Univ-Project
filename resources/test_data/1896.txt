to try to leave a habitable world for future generations ; for this reason , the abuse of resources as though there were no tomorrow is disgraceful .
I welcome the substance of the agreement with Canada on the use of Advance Passenger Information ( API ) / Passenger Name Records ( PNR ) data of passengers on flights to Canada .
One of these is rightly Belarus , where events over a number of years are cause for serious concern .
China ’s power – both now and in the future – is not exclusively military in nature .
No democracy poses a threat to us , whereas a military , diplomatic and demographic power with huge economic strength and without democratic checks and balances might pose a medium - or long-term threat .     .
I therefore welcome the decision adopted by the Conference of Presidents on 9 June to invite the parliaments of Bulgaria and Romania to appoint parliamentary observers and to welcome those representatives from 26 September 2005 until the countries formally join the EU.     . –The archipelagos of the Azores , Madeira and the Canary Islands , and the French overseas departments , are referred to as the EU’s outermost regions and are characterised by their remoteness , insularity , small size , difficult topography and climate and economic dependence on a few products .
The proposal currently before us maintains the previous programmes , but proposes a radical change of philosophy , whereby the management of programmes is made easier and the decision-making process is brought closer to those principally affected , namely the regions themselves , whilst at the same time maintaining the level of support granted in the past .
Consequently , in some cases these industries need to complement their supplies with raw materials from outside and to export or dispatch their products to ensure their viability .
Fourthly , as regards the basis for defining the financial ceilings , I feel that the reference period of 2001 to 2003 is inappropriate for defining the amount of funding , as this takes no account of the impact of changes made under the 2001 reform .
I trust that the Commission will appreciate the enormous importance of this issue to the outermost regions , and I naturally ask the Members of this House to vote in favour of this report .     . – I should like to congratulate Mr Freitas and all of the ( many ) Members from the outermost regions and elsewhere involved in drawing up this report .
With this kind of attitude , we can achieve a positive outcome on this issue , too .
Of the suggestions and amendments that we tabled , I shall mention only the most relevant ones .
The third aspect is that of exports .
Each programme will contain a description of the current agricultural situation , its weaknesses and potential , the proposed strategy , the expected impact and a timetable of implementation .
The agricultural and supply policies provide for special treatment tailored to the specific reality of each outermost region , and this special treatment has been improved upon and strengthened in the light of experience gained with the implementation of the Posei schemes .
The report before us – on the proposal for a Council regulation laying down specific measures for agriculture in the outermost regions – forms part of the process of implementing that strategy .
This will be achieved by means of stepping up participation in the decision-making process , which is a positive step and one that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament wholeheartedly supports .
Today we have seen a degree of openness on the part of Mr Michel ; time will tell if there is more to come in the future .
The system of limiting exports of products under the specific supply arrangements to third countries and dispatch to the rest of the Community has served to choke the local agri-food industry .
The presence of international observers , of which our mission was the most significant in terms of numbers and professional commitment , was a key factor in instilling confidence among the electorate , who turned out in their droves and 90 % voted .
We called at the time for an independent inquiry and we continue to do so .
I have just heard the news that the main opposition announced this morning that it is pulling out of the complaint investigation process due to its representatives allegedly being obstructed .
The specific characteristics of farming and market supply in the outermost regions are evident and are rightly acknowledged by the EU.
We therefore feel that the urgent debate on relations with Syria should be replaced by one on the situation in Belarus .     – Commissioner Mandelson’s recent statements have been alarming and unacceptable .
Secondly , I should like to thank all of the Members of this Chamber , from north , south , east and west , and from all political groups , who have expressed specifically to us – the Portuguese socialists – their solidarity with the victims of the drought and the fires currently ravaging the western Iberian Peninsula , with Portugal very much the worst affected region .
We must also look into forest policy in order to ensure that it takes greater account of the climatic characteristics of the west of the Peninsula .     – We welcome the scheduling of this debate , as we proposed at the beginning of August .
In light of the seriousness of the situation , the Commission must quickly step up its collaboration with the national authorities to support the populations , to help minimise the effects of the fires and the flooding , to support all national support initiatives aimed at restoring the production capacities of the affected regions , thereby creating jobs and providing compensation for the social costs involved in job losses and destruction of livelihoods
