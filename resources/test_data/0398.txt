test aircraft without passengers , as well as data from the national authorities , from the manufacturers of aeroplane engine parts and from the European Aviation Safety Agency in Cologne .
I am very pleased , Mr President , Mr Buzek , that the European Parliament has proposed a detailed debate on this issue .
As soon as this became apparent , the European Commission , along with the Spanish Presidency of the Council and Eurocontrol , immediately set to work , and on Sunday - as Mr Kallas said earlier - there was a public appearance by the Commission and the Presidency - Mr Kallas and myself - explaining the situation and setting out what was going to be done .
I believe that what was immediately seen is that in this case , the European approach meant that a much more balanced decision could be adopted .
That is why I am again calling on all the European Union governments to help get people home , to make use of every possible means of communication , and to make a special , extraordinary effort to do so , because that is the main right that citizens have : to go home , to go to wherever they want to go .
Mr President , I just wanted to congratulate the Commission and its President , José Manuel Durão Barroso , on the ambitious , very pro-European programme that he has presented here today , which is clearly in line with the objectives of the Spanish Presidency of the European Union and with the programme of the trio of presidencies made up of Spain , Belgium and Hungary .
I am sure that we are going to have Parliament 's cooperation as well .
We have seen that , for the first time , the International Monetary Fund is not having to rescue a Latin American country , but a European Member State that is part of the Monetary Union .
At the same time , Parliament welcomes the initiatives that you have put forward to establish the Europe-Latin America Foundation and also the financial investment facility .
We also need to develop the association agreements with Mexico and Chile , which have been a real success .
Nevertheless , I think that what is important is for the relationship to continue to be promoted and strengthened after that Presidency has ended .
I will conclude , Madam President , by saying that of course , all of this must be considered within the framework of what the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament considers to be the basic socio-political philosophy in this area .
I am also happy that the Verts/ALE Group has succeeded in including the cultural rights of indigenous peoples , a proposal that came from the Committee on Development .
Will you speak out against mega-projects like the dam at Del Monte on the River Shingu in Brazil , which is being planned at the moment , and which will destroy swathes of living space for the indigenous peoples and is also not the best solution in terms of energy consumption ?
I would like to take this opportunity to ask Mrs Ashton to intercede on behalf of a dissident , Marta Beatriz Roque , who is on conditional release and is ill .
We represent 25 % of their exports , and they represent 2 % of ours .
The implementation of the Treaty of Lisbon and the creation of the office of High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy , as well as the European External Action Service , provide us with a dual opportunity .
It is a complex exercise in squaring the circle , but we hope that we can take it forward , together with the Commission .
We are also concerned , although there has been some discussion , that the resources of the Ninth and Tenth EDFs managed by the European Investment Bank ( EIB ) are not covered by the statement of assurance and should therefore be the subject of regular reports by the EIB .
We also welcome the fact that the annual accounts of the Trans-European Transport Network Executive Agency are legal and regular , although we are concerned at the delays in recruitment .
I believe that the Council budget for the 2008 financial year was correctly implemented , as can be deduced from the annual report of the Court of Auditors .
That is what Mr Gerbrandy said .
Criticising their absence when we had not even taken the trouble to invite them appears to me to be bordering on the ridiculous and bad faith .
The recommendation was immediately submitted to the rapporteur and certain Members of the European Parliament and forwarded to the Council of the Union .
As for exchanging data with third countries , our understanding is that , when the US authorities have grounds to think that there are data that may help authorities in other countries to prosecute terrorist crimes , such data should be used .
Parliament rightly considers that it , too , must be involved in this agreement , and we therefore agree that it should be provided with adequate information and that the Commission , as the negotiator of this agreement , should pass on that information at each stage in the negotiations .
I believe it shows that there is a real spirit of cooperation on both sides , among all the parties involved : Parliament , the Commission and the Council .
I would like to tell you that we cannot , of course , accept indiscriminate bulk transfer , whatever may be requested for any purpose .
It must be made clear , though , that the period must be as short as possible and no longer than is necessary to achieve the objective .
