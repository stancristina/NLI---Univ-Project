This way trade can be made to boost economic growth , the reduction in poverty and social development in the developing countries .
The developing countries themselves , however , must also be prepared to implement national reforms , promote good government and eradicate corruption .
In October a joint sitting will be held for both Ministers for Trade and Ministers for Development with the aim of achieving a strong commitment on the part of the EU to the World Trade Organisation’s ‘aid for trade’ recommendations and their speedy application in practice .
I also believe that we will be ready to go forward with decision-making in December .
The European Union’s human rights policy must nevertheless be founded on exactly the same rules in different parts of the world .
It is still an important objective for the EU to become a party to the European Convention on Human Rights .
A report by Luxembourg’s Prime Minister , Jean-Claude Juncker , contains excellent proposals for closer cooperation between the two organisations , but we have to work to implement the contents of this report .
Allow me to wax nostalgic for a moment .
The initiative was adopted with the Treaty of Amsterdam and today the cornerstone of the Union’s fast evolving crisis management policy is military and civil development and their successful coordination .
Hopefully , the situation will now remain stable , so that the campaigning and second round of elections can proceed peacefully and in a way that respects the democratic process .
The European Union is also working hard to resolve the difficult situation in Darfur .
The Union is the biggest supporter of the African Union’s African Mission in Sudan peacekeeping operation .
There are thus ever-growing expectations with regard to international action on the part of the European Union .
It is , however , vital that the parties involved will show commitment to its implementation .
The Member States of the European Union have taken a major role in the UN’s extended UNIFIL operation , which lends support to the frail ceasefire and attempts at establishing lasting peace in the region as a whole .
They are committed to sending approximately 7 000 peacekeeping troops to support the UNIFIL operation .
The entire UN operation is being headed by us Europeans , first by France and then by Italy .
This way the parties involved will have much greater confidence in the operation’s success .
To improve the country ’s difficult humanitarian situation , the total amount in aid granted by the European Commission and the Member States is now more than EUR 300 million .
In addition to granting direct humanitarian aid , the Union must play a major role in the reconstruction work and in repairing the damage done to the environment .
Everyone has to commit to the existence of two secure and viable countries .
Trust also needs to be built at the level of civil society and not just between governments , which in itself is obviously important .
I have already worked with the UN’s women’s organisation UNIFEM , which supports dialogue between Israeli and Palestinian women .
It is vitally important that in the future the European Union shows determination in establishing stability and security throughout the Middle East .
Iran must comply with the UN Security Council’s resolution and now actually seize the opportunity for genuine dialogue .
The fate of Russia and that of the rest of Europe have been interwoven for centuries .
Today , Russia is a strategic partner of the EU.
Broadly-based cooperation , ranging from trade to human rights , will benefit both parties and will also lend support to Russia’s democratic development and stability .
Most of the issues , however , are the sort where cooperation is vitally important .
This energy dialogue between the EU and Russia must be built on trust .
After all , we know that current energy resources are not limitless .
The EU must also aspire to broadly based cooperation with Russia in the area of the environment .
These are the economy , freedom , justice and security , external security , and research , education and culture .
The term of the Partnership and Co-operation Agreement between the Union and Russia expires at the end of next year .
The Northern Dimension’s main focus is on environmental cooperation and social and health issues .
I think that the European Union must be open in the future to all European countries that meet the conditions of membership .
Developments in the countries of Central Europe , in Turkey , in Croatia and in the Western Balkans are a clear indication of the power of the EU membership perspective as an incentive for reform , although , of course , the fundamental aim of the changes must be each country ’s desire to improve the ordinary lives and security of its own people .
At the European Council in December there will be a general debate on enlargement .
The result in the end was that no new membership criteria should be set , but the existing criteria should be strictly adhered to .
We should also remember what the list of requirements does not contain .
Varying political views are a natural part of Europe .
You and your political groups are a unique example of political party cooperation that extends across national borders .
This has been a long speech , and I know that we all have a busy autumn ahead , both you in Parliament and us in the country to hold the presidency and the other Member States too .
I believe that it has become clear to all of us that ‘Global Challenges – Joint Responses ’ is a principle and objective that we all share , and it is also ASEM’s motto .
I will confess to you the other reason : I also intend to pay a visit to the
