: it tells us how difficult it is to promote and support human rights and democracy when we are faced with a totalitarian regime and we have been trying everything for years : constructive dialogue , economic cooperation , humanitarian aid .
I would like , first of all , to express my deep satisfaction at the fact that the Thessaloniki Council endorsed the draft Constitution adopted by the Convention , describing it as a historic step towards achieving the objectives of European integration and then describing the Treaty as a 'sound basis ' upon which to open the Intergovernmental Conference which is to take place during the Italian Presidency .
It would not just be the failure of the Presidency or the Convention : it would be failure to live up to the expectations of those millions upon millions of Europeans who genuinely believe that the time has come to establish not just common rules but common , shared values too .
A great deal has been achieved .
To preserve this spirit and ensure continuity and consistency with the work carried out by the Convention , I believed and continue to believe it desirable for the representatives of the Commission and the European Parliament to take part in Conference and for the Chairman of the Convention and its Vice-Chairmen , Mr Amato and Mr Dehaene , to take part too .
It is in a spirit of fidelity to its Europeanist tradition , which is the heritage of the Italian people and of all the political groupings of my country , that the Italian Presidency intends to conduct the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference .
The future Constitutional Treaty - a Constitution for Europe , as Mr Giscard d'Estaing has described it - can then be signed sometime between 1 May 2004 , the date on which the ten new Member States will join the Union , and the European Parliament elections scheduled for June 2004 .
From this point of view , the opinions presented by Parliament and the European Commission will be factors to be taken into full consideration in the course of the Conference .
Any other solution would , indeed , represent a step backwards in relation to the democratic method for revising the Treaties based on the principle and the requirement of transparency and consideration for the citizens .
The successful experiment of the Convention has brought a lasting change in the course of democratic life in the European Union .
I see two extreme standpoints emerging and I believe we need to discuss this frankly .
It therefore involves a new phase of political ownership .
That does not , of course , demand a lengthy Intergovernmental Conference , but it does call for a proper period of reflection .
The task of the Intergovernmental Conference is to make the work of the institutions more transparent and more effective and to prevent duplication and halfway solutions that may breed future conflicts .
Essentially , this has been the case every time the Treaties have been amended .
This is true of unanimous decision-making , which still applies today in many sectors , and it is therefore even more true when it comes to bringing policies up to date , a process which we are unable to tackle now .
This takes the form of support for the most vulnerable in an inclusive society .
Mr President , the text adopted by the Convention indisputably represents a step forward for European democracy .
Clearly , this shifted the emphasis of the debate from what the Union should do and how to who wins and who loses under the new rules , which is typical of an Intergovernmental Conference and the basic cause of the regrettable failure of Nice .
If it is not possible to do this , if the unanimity safety mechanism is preserved , it is not difficult to predict what will happen in the future : the Union will be unable to move forward , unable to act , and , in the long term , it will become increasingly insignificant and divided .
Some progress has been made , some of the pensions which were not transferable between countries have been abolished , but the majority are still in existence , with the result that , when people with disabilities travel in Europe , they have to leave their pension for their government , which certainly does not need it .
It is with pleasure and satisfaction that I welcome the Community programme , Daphne II , on the prevention of violence against children , young people and women , supported by the delegation of which I am head and by the entire UEN Group .
If only the European governments were as diligent and if only the European Union were as willing to take the same interest and ensure the same accuracy in the statistics which relate to us , poor common mortals !
There is discrimination against elderly people and people with disabilities , who are given - or not given - financial support just because they are over , or under , 65 years old .
I regret to say that they detract attention not only from the reconstruction work in progress and the necessary measures for a speedy return to normality but also from the many indications of a genuine renewal : exchanges of opinions , freedom of religious practice , institutions representing an initial , albeit hesitant , stage of democracy , and the attempt to re-establish equal opportunities and rights .
The Presidency therefore hopes that , in the coming weeks , a broad majority in favour of a greater UN undertaking in Iraq will develop in the Security Council , and it is making every effort - I , personally , am making every effort - working closely with the principal players of the international community , to achieve this important goal .
