I would like to ask the Commissioner whether the Commission has drawn any conclusions on what is now required of applicant countries to improve the status of the Romany population .
I do not believe it is enough to speak of sustainable development in a general way .
We need to adopt an approach that aims to promote the improvement of the environment .
The best way of guiding consumer behaviour is by putting money in consumers ' pockets , and the Auto-Oil programme is a good example of this .
The forthcoming AGENDA 2000 programme now under discussion in Parliament and the Council is a concrete indication of where we really want to be heading .
In agriculture it is not enough to say that it is the task of the Member States to see to it that the environmental objectives agreed on are met .
The work that precedes enlargement is important and it requires great efforts , because we cannot allow a situation where new states join before they have completed their environmental preparations and lengthy transitional periods are therefore needed .
We know that if enlargement goes ahead like this it will only harm the state of the environment in the future .
Madam President , I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Chanterie , for his very broad coverage of this issue and for having taken account of the views of the committees .
The committee has also observed that the manufacturers of homeopathic medicinal products are usually small and medium-sized companies , and they are greatly hampered in their work by the diversity that exists in legislation and approval procedures among the different countries .
In this way we can ensure that there will be no safety risk of any kind .
But those countries where homeopathy is better known have been able to confirm that these medicines do not cause side-effects .
They are cheap , and , although the effect mechanisms cannot always be clearly ascertained using traditional methods , they work .
Mr President , the Commission 's proposal for the second phase of the Socrates programme connects with the broader situation .
Together with one other programme , the Culture 2000 programme , they represent a substantial confirmation of the EU cultural dimension .
Likewise , the committee considered it important to promote job creation through these programmes and also in cooperation with the research and new technology programmes .
The Commission proposed ECU 1 400 million in funding for the next five year period .
The Committee on Budgets considered this figure to be acceptable as an initial guide , but wished to establish some leeway and therefore tabled Amendment No 1 , which proposes a 20 % margin to allow for deviation from the sum allocated , should any new objectives or permanent factors that are clearly and precisely justifiable present themselves .
They represent a large item of expenditure , approximately ECU 85 million , which eats into the normal resources considerably .
For that reason , the Committee on Budgets continues to give this Commission proposal its strong support , just as we did before .
The significance of the exchange programmes in relation , for example , to the process of Union enlargement or the aim of equivalence in qualifications cannot be overstated .
It is vital to ensure that young people continue to be involved in the preparation of programmes , and the Commission must see to it that the voice of those participating in programmes makes itself heard in the working parties which decide on programme form and content .
In this way we can ensure that the programmes will continue to be popular in the future .
My impression is that European voters are looking to the left for protection against the forces of money and uncontrolled market trends .
While Britain continues to rely on the market to create jobs , in France and Italy there is a drive to shorten working hours and raise public spending to increase employment .
The first of these is the lowering of interest rates , to prevent Europe from falling into the abyss .
Unfortunately , the European Central Bank , which is ruled by the economic dogma of the last couple of decades , does not seem ready to lower interest rates so that production and employment might increase .
The current tax system favours ownership , investments and lazy money too much , and penalises work .
Fourthly , we must embark on action to shorten working time generally .
Mr President , my colleague , Mr Hughes , has produced an excellent report .
We would also like Parliament to remind everyone of the importance of childcare , without which equality between women and men will make no progress whatsoever .
We know that Mr Flynn has made enormous efforts here , and we would like Parliament to support him in this .
We would like this to be emphasised in the enlargement negotiations .
My thanks to France .
We are hanging flesh on the same skeleton .
Market forces have no social or ecological responsibility .
For example , the views of consumers in Europe on the one hand , and the USA on the other , on health foods are fundamentally different .
We do not want to eat poison-resistant , genetically-modified soya , maize or potatoes , nor any other new American foods .
Madam President , it is vital to focus and coordinate the aid for the applicant countries effectively by means of the three instruments available if we are to achieve maximum possible benefit .
Aid to improve nuclear safety must also be concentrated in accordance with the PHARE programme .
We have to prepare for the consequences of structural change in agriculture with an effective , wide-ranging rural policy to create new and varied enterprise action and new jobs , and that is
