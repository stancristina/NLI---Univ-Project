Central and Western Europe , and one that needs sufficiently efficient and competitive maritime links .
This is the main thing that has kept passenger numbers high and traffic busy , thus enabling , furthermore , high freight capacity .
Effective and regular car ferry services are a part of Finland 's main route connections to Scandinavia , the Baltic and thus to elsewhere in Europe .
Any deterioration in these will mean higher freight costs and bottlenecks regarding capacity , causing problems for economic development for the whole country .
This would have an immediate and deteriorating effect on maritime employment .
The rise in costs and transportation difficulties will also mean an increase in costs to the export industry , affecting its competitiveness and , indirectly , employment .
The flip side to the coin is always the knowledge that someone is trying to abuse freedoms .
The grossest form of abuse is unarguably the spread of child pornography and paedophile material .
According to a study by Interpol , the result of just two months ' monitoring of the network revealed over 70 000 sights containing images of child pornography .
Although their role as guardians of self-regulation is a crucial one , we can only achieve the results we want through tight cooperation between the authorities responsible for the form and content of the computer technology industry and the Internet .
A good example of official initiative in the fight against child pornography is the tip-off phone and web page set up by the Finnish police , which you can contact to give information on paedophile activity you have found on the network .
Mr President , Mrs Oomen-Ruijten 's report has an unusually long and colourful history here in Parliament .
When our committee discussed the report last February , most of the group voted against it .
This time , in Finland at least , a debate has arisen on the absolute necessity of transnational trade union rights as a counterweight to transnational markets .
Under no circumstances can European trade union rights be allowed to have a weakening effect on national and statutory rights .
When our committee discussed the report last February , I voted against it .
The basis for that decision then was that it was a matter of principle , and a delicate one too , and we could not come to any hasty conclusions .
Events last winter showed , however , that unless workers ' right to strike is safeguarded at European level , it might be tampered with in the name of internal markets and their ability to function .
Mr President , I would like to speak in favour of Mrs van Dijk 's report being switched , for example , to Tuesday , as it would be most regrettable if it were not discussed until Friday and the voting did not take place until September , when Mrs van Dijk will no longer be a member of this Parliament .
Because I myself am the European Parliament 's easternmost Member , from near the Russian border , I cannot help acknowledging the fact that I am very much in touch with problems connected with cross-border cooperation between Finland and Russia .
That would be an excellent way to solve this problem .
I also think it an excellent and most welcome proposal from the Committee on Regional Policy that coordination between TACIS-CBC and INTERREG should be included in structural fund reforms .
The frontier between Finland and Russia is the frontier between the EU and Russia , and the European Union must also bear the responsibility for smooth and contained operations at border-crossing points .
We warmly support the basic proposals it contains , such as the notion of one integrated funding system , and the idea that all activity should be coordinated very visibly in conjunction with other funding instruments , like INTERREG , for example .
I believe in future we must lay much more emphasis on problems of the environment , and we think it is right that the report separately identifies the problems of nuclear safety .
But we should also aim to actually shut down these nuclear reactors completely and deal with the problems of nuclear waste in a satisfactory manner .
I would still like to mention that it is terribly important that proper social policy be developed in Russia , exactly because of this huge gap in the standard of living .
Experiences with the TACIS programme have not always been positive however .
Furthermore , the programme lacks a proper investment component .
Opportunities for funding therefore have to be improved considerably .
I wish to finish by laying emphasis on the importance of the speedy resolution of environmental and nuclear safety problems that exist in the Russian/EU border regions by using the TACIS programme to its best advantage .
Mr President , first I should like to thank Mr Ribeiro for a very thorough and in-depth report .
In trying to cope with both structural changes in the sector and present uncertainty , the most important factor , alongside technical development , has proved to be social innovation , such as the reorganization of work , greater autonomy of workers , and management methods .
The European textile and clothing industry has been made competitive mainly by an efficient , skilled workforce , high-quality , innovative and up-to-date production methods , and specialization and flexibility in the industry .
Weaknesses in the sector in Europe have long been due to unfair access to markets .
An example of this is the latest agreement with Russia .
Large centres of population in Finland do not qualify for this kind of aid .
I would like to remind everyone that EU aid and action to encourage competitiveness must be such as to avoid distortion of competition and guarantee companies the same opportunities for competition in the market .
