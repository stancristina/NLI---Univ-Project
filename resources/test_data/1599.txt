The focus with regard to traffic is on the development of the trans-European transport network .
The Community should also be investing in developing travel and tourism , particularly by supporting SMEs in this field .
Mr President , right at the start I would like to thank Jutta Haug , as budget rapporteur , for the cooperation she demonstrated in dealing with appropriations relating to culture , youth , education and communication in the budget .
The Committee on Budgets has also shown understanding with regard to financing the Media Plus programme , which is still open .
I am sorry , however , that the Committee on Budgets voted to enter in the reserve Commission appropriations for information activities .
In all the EU spends just under two euros for each citizen on training , youth exchange programmes , culture projects , and support and information with regard to audio-visual production .
Decisions on applications for support have taken a long time and payments have been delayed .
We have to find a remedy for this .
That is vital for the programme aims to succeed but also for the legitimacy of the EU.
We were not entirely successful in this .
I wish , furthermore , to turn our attention to the financing of Euronews .
Mr President , Mrs Jutta Haug and Mr Markus Ferber have been involved in an enormous task in drafting next years ' EU budget .
Similarly , I would like to thank Mrs Rühle and Mr Colom i Naval and , in particular , the Chairman of the Committee , Terence Wynn .
My own group is satisfied that strict budgetary discipline was adhered to in the drafting of the budget .
Administration in the EU has been inexcusably poor , since , for example , last spring around EUR 3 billion of unused funds were returned to Member States .
At present massive unemployment is the scourge of the EU.
For that reason , it is appropriate to increase significantly the financing of unemployment initiatives .
The most difficult problems in the new budget concern external action .
However , just EUR 1 850 million were set aside for the development of this region at Berlin , while EUR 4 500 million were spent during the previous period .
The Balkans war , months of bombing and the tremendous devastation that followed will lead to bitterness and hatred that may even last for generations among the inhabitants of the region unless the EU also takes responsibility for the reconstruction work .
The committee is also aiming at a multiannual financial framework for both the CARDS and the MEDA programmes .
This would serve to lessen the yearly conflict that has tainted the preparation of the EU budget in the last couple of years .
Mr President , President-in-Office , there happens to be a section of the Finnish government ' s programme which refers to sources of taxation such as these .
Could you compile a new package of reforms from this on behalf of the Council ?
You are quite right and I would also like to remind you that we have already once discussed this subject in great detail , and these very same colleagues of mine asked the same questions before .
The reason why we have been quiet here on the right is therefore that we have already examined these matters once and , in our opinion , we do not need to talk about the same issues over and over again in this Chamber and use up our precious time doing so .
The adoption of the Tobin tax on a global scale will be impossible .
At the same time I bring greetings from Mr Sánchez , who would have liked to be here at this debate , but has not been able to attend yet , owing to illness .
Adapted action , which is meant to support the outermost regions , is justified as a result of the unfavourable conditions that prevail in these areas .
Neither may EU enlargement be allowed to cause these regions to fall outside the sphere of influence of regional and structural policy .
Our group is also in favour of broadening the scope of Article 299( 2 ) of the EC Treaty , which will strengthen the positive achievements of the POSEI programmes in remote areas .
In my opinion , it is very important that the outermost regions are integrated into the trans-European transport , energy and telecommunications networks .
He has withstood the pressures he has come up against in this emotional issue extremely well .
In my opinion , that was a wise policy .
It is , however , important to define what we expect from the Food Safety Agency and what sort of criteria should apply in selecting its location .
They include good reputation in the field of food safety , independence , and good scientific infrastructure incorporating the best available technology and good transport and telecommunications links .
In talks , there has been a call for the agency to be located in a city in which one of our Institutions is located , as , otherwise , it could not be supervised .
There must be other reasons for the euro ' s low value than the fact that the European Central Bank is situated in Frankfurt .
Mr President , very rarely from within the established power structures does anything new emerge .
The ban on anti-personnel mines has led to a process that is an excellent example of how NGOs and the European Parliament have been able to define and pursue with determination aims the statesmen either shun or consider unrealistic .
It must also be made a precondition of EU membership for the candidate countries , i .e . become incorporated in the acquis communautaire .
The Brok resolution , for its part , offers a political
