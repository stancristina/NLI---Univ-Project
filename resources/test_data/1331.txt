Allow me to comment briefly on the main elements of the proposal .
More importantly , the proposal makes provision for the tactic of re-evaluating all recognised countries every five years .
The examination on the part of the Council allowed us to introduce certain amendments which improve our initial proposal .
.
We shall vote against this report because , despite any efforts to mitigate the adverse arrangements , it moves along the same lines as the Commission .
Finally , the Mastorakis report includes worthwhile special proposals .
The enlargement of the ? U with 10 new members and the stagnation of the Community budget at the same levels are giving rise to serious concerns about Union action in island regions , mountain regions and regions with a low population density in the Union .
Finally , I wish to emphasise the urgent need to stop soil erosion in island areas , such as the Aegean , with an extensive drywall network conservation programme .
The Commission is prepared to accept almost half the amendments passed by Parliament , which really do improve the proposal .
The Commission , however , cannot agree to the amendments introducing the possibility of withdrawing the recognition of individual maritime training institutes in third countries , namely Amendments Nos 3 , 12 , 15 , 17 and 20 .
The Commission greatly appreciates Parliament 's efforts to examine the withdrawal of these amendments .
I believe that , in order to avoid ambiguities during communications between ship and shore , the parties directly involved in the communication should communicate in the language with which they are most familiar .
In addition to this , I should like in particular to draw your attention to the Council conclusions on improving Community shipping and seafaring professions approved by the Ministers for Transport in Luxembourg this year .
The Commission believes that , given the urgency of such situations , the Member States should be given the opportunity to withdraw their endorsement even before informing the other Member States .
We are certain that the European Parliament will support the Commission 's views on the above amendments .
I would remind the European Parliament that , eighteen months ago , a specific action plan promoting mobility was agreed and a number of these important promotional measures concerned the need for coordination and cooperation between social security systems , but not just that .
In other words , this regulation urgently needs to be simplified and updated and this is precisely the aim of the Commission proposal .
The proposed regulation will apply not only to workers who move but also to all citizens of the European Union covered by the social security legislation of a Member State .
The third important amendment proposed by the Commission concerns unemployment benefits for cross-frontier workers .
Thus , we believe that this proposal will help not only to update the system , which is necessary , but also to simplify it , so that it functions more smoothly both for the citizens and the Member States .
This being so , I should like to ask the Commissioner if there are any plans to investigate the question of worsening pollution as a result of this photochemical pollution and micro particles and the factor of the works for the Olympic Games , which are being carried out without suitable measures being taken to protect citizens ' health .
It is an issue which horizontally touches all European Union policies .
It is well in keeping with the Commission proposals and communication .
We share the same principles and the same objectives .
The emphasis has shifted from the medical model to the so-called social standard , to building a policy based on fundamental human rights , on the one hand , and on social rights and guaranteed equal opportunities on the other .
Discussions with the Council have continued up to today , while at the same time the Commission is working closely with the Presidency on the pre-preparatory work for the Convention .
Although it is difficult in the initial stage to call for disability to be incorporated into the central body of development aid policies , this is a clear declaration that disability must be included and dealt with in the policies of every state in all sectors .
Most countries have not yet presented even a preliminary bill for transposing this directive , even though the final deadline is December 2003 .
I think that this would create a difficult situation in the Council and it would perhaps make it even more difficult to adopt the first directive , which has come up against the difficulties I referred to earlier .
Participation in these negotiations will also continue after the European Year of Disability within the framework of continuing action here , because our objective is to present an action plan at European level at the end of 2003 , at the end of the Year of Disability , which will be the result of all the work carried out in all the Member States during this year , so that we have commitments on the part of the Member States at legislative , budgetary , policy and programme level .
What is not mentioned , however , is that the problem of disability does not concern a separate group of unlucky people ; it concerns all of us , because we are all potentially disabled .
However , what has not yet been fully realised is that this is not just a question of additional recognition of certain extra rights of a group of people .
Universal access to public services is a dead letter if the obstacles to access to services for the disabled are not removed .
This sort of celebratory proclamation has a practical impact not only when it is confined to raising people 's awareness or collating material , but also when provision is made for
