ask the Commission and the Council - and subsequently , Parliament - to issue an opinion at this part-session on a fact that has only recently been brought to our attention .
We can obviously disregard them and prefer to believe , like the President of Sun Micro Systems at the World Economic Forum in New York , that globalisation is a good thing and that nothing needs to be changed .
We do not always know how war begins to become a part of everyday life , but we all know what it can lead to .
All the developed countries have experienced periods of protectionism , although protectionism is , in the long run , detrimental to development .
If I have to mention some of the highlights , ladies and gentlemen , I would choose a debt tribunal , which is lending support throughout the crisis in Argentina , which outlined the extent of the devastating effects caused by the structural adjustment policies and the burden of debt .
Secondly , this movement is diverse and , as previous speakers have said , we can make ironic comments as to its diversity , as we have done with other social movements .
There must also be the vision of 'living together ', of solidarity between rich regions and poorer regions , and of access for everyone to a number of fundamental rights .
This involves defining targeted local information which is as credible as possible .
Your idea to develop a 'one-stop-shop ' in each country for European citizens is very much in line with the concerns of the Commission .
To sum up , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this venture that we are embarking upon together is of enormous scope , but it is also very exciting .
We cannot accept a common position today that is still too similar to the position adopted at first reading .
The Council and the Commission have not taken Parliament 's opinion into account .
In 2002 , 12 800 employees are due to retire , approximately 2 000 workers need to be recruited , which equates to 10 000 job cuts .
This includes the French socialist government , which urges us all to approve it .
We must therefore guarantee that the opening up to competition will not have any negative consequences on the access to postal services in the most isolated or most remote regions .
In short , they have demonised the debate and pretended that conciliation is a bad thing .
I therefore think it is important to use the Internet .
This imbalance is unacceptable .
Germany , for example , is in theory 100 % open , but less than 3 % of its electricity is imported .
Mr President , I do not share the enthusiasm of the majority of our fellow Members for the result obtained with regard to this directive .
This is a historical fact that cannot be denied .
We know it , fundamentalism or not .
In this Assembly , from now on , with the vote on this directive , let us give women the means and the signal to cast off their chains and let us once more assume our responsibilities .
This is the main benefit for our businesses , and therefore for SMUs too .
It would involve a fundamental change in international relations .
Secondly , as it happens , the WTO disputes settlement procedure is still in its infancy .
I would like to remind you that biodiversity plays a part in our own survival and that although nature does not need man to survive , we , as human beings , need nature in order to live .
We need additional action plans , particularly for forestry and for transport , as all these Community policies had or still have a negative impact on biodiversity .
Nonetheless , as rapporteur , I hope that the references to the environmental liability of GMOs for polluting the countryside are retained .
What are we aiming to achieve with this maximum protection approach towards biodiversity ?
First of all , the proposal for a directive provides a specific response to a reality , namely the lack of an internal market , which has damaging repercussions both for the economic actors in this sector and for consumers .
By way of example , it is currently virtually impossible for a vitamin manufacturer based in the UK to export and place his products on the market in Belgium or in France , for instance .
Firstly , the legitimate concern of consumers with regard to the BSE epidemic and the terrifying human form of BSE , namely Kreutzfeld-Jacob 's disease .
I can only reaffirm that , at local level , the professional workers , employees , citizens and local authorities , if they failed to grasp the scientific justification of this text , would find it hard to understand that , after all their efforts ( sanitary measures , tests , slaughtering herds ) , the European Union is asking them to make a further effort which goes beyond the financial limits that they are able to cope with .
I wish to talk about the statements which are made from time to time - and too often for my liking - by the leaders of candidate countries , political declarations which emphasise the bilateral conflicts between neighbouring countries in Central Europe , countries which today aspire to join the European Union .
Here it seems to me that there is a lack of information in our countries .
We know perfectly well that it is not acceptable to blame imports for all of the difficulties faced by the American steel industry , even if globally there is still surplus capacity .
We will take these measures in full compliance with WTO rules
