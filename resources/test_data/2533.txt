Madam President , I will not prolong this speech , but my intention was not sabotage .
It is true that I speak good English and it is true that I teach English , but I am not a lawyer .
Mr President , first I would like to turn to Mr Schr√∂der , whom I know to be a very agreeable representative for his country in this Parliament , and thank him for his short and concrete report .
The liberal group supports the programme and wants to see it implemented and strengthened along with an expanded internal cooperation between the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and between these countries and Russia and other OECD countries .
Both this report and the Commission document fulfil an important function .
The EU is currently the largest donor of aid to Latin America although , politically speaking , the region is of less importance to Europe now , despite the fact that culturally and ideologically we have grown closer in recent years .
To discuss , in this context , the inclusion , in the political dialogue with these countries , of EU security and defence aspects of the cooperation is , in my opinion , a step in the wrong direction .
The report also takes up the question of control over the export of weapons .
This must be seen as the first step towards a global restriction of the trade in weapons .
Mr President , as has been stated already , there are exciting changes taking place within the telecommunications industry .
But there are no 'free lunches ' .
The description to be found here and in many other Directives covering the Telecommunications market does not in any way correspond to the situation which exists in those Member States which have come furthest along the path of liberalisation of the telecommunication market , Scandinavian countries for example .
What can we learn from this ?
That , for this sector , where technical progress is moving forwards we find ourselves out of step which will lead to misuse of our resources and which will alter Europe 's competitiveness .
Mr President , the Telecommunications industry is growing and it is now vital to ensure that the personal details held in digital telecommunications networks are protected against improper use .
This is clearly regulated in the Swedish principle of openness and the Data Protection Act has worked well .
It is one way of resolving congestion and environmental problems , but a number of conditions must be met , for example , public transport must be accessible .
The second important thing is that there must be competition .
There are large discrepancies between Member States in the extent to which public transport is subsidised , perhaps because the service is purchased in very different ways .
I am convinced that , if we can meet the requirements , public transport has a significant and considerably more active role to play in the future .
Joint strategies ought to be restricted to issues of a general character .
There is a risk that the use of subsidies will perpetuate an ineffective structure and reduce both short and long term profitability .
It is also important that fresh ideas are not unfairly treated as a result of political decisions .
It is preferable to link forestry issues with issues related to the forestry industry and not to agricultural policy .
As a representative of Europe 's most densely forested country , I would just like to say the following to any potential supporters of a fully regulated , joint forestry policy : to those who wish ill on Europe 's forestry industry , there is now a fate worse than more forest fires .
Here , there is no desire to further enlarge the forest , instead people are anxious to preserve the open landscape and the biological diversity that it represents .
On the one hand forest protection is highlighted , while on the other , the emphasis is placed , and indeed priority is placed , on better commercial use .
It already has enough work coping with the tasks in hand .
Of course there are some good ideas in this report , including those concerned with the environment and with certification , but the question is how much space will be allocated to these ideas in a joint forestry strategy .
It is a question of 'use ' and in the English original the word 'exploitation ' is actually used .
All this , Mr President , leads me to believe that we should vote against this report , especially if we compare it with Swedish forestry legislation which is much better , but still much discussed in Sweden .
This should not be seen as a criticism against the report itself but more a way of expressing our scepticism of a joint forestry strategy for the Union .
As many speakers have pointed out , the problems vary enormously in the Countries of the Union .
Individual countries have forestry laws and the necessary authorities to administer these laws .
There is no lack of international cooperation either .
Trade problems are resolved within the framework of the WTO and so on .
We already have such certification , and it is well known that certain competitor countries on the other side of the Atlantic have exerted pressure on the Union to adopt certification at a lower level than we have in Scandinavia .
This is why such varied proposals have been put forward during the debate .
It has already been stated earlier in the debate that Swedish forestry legislation has allowed us to create a sustainable and strong forestry industry which maintains a balance between the interests of the environment and of production .
Such a policy should not be introduced within the European Union .
This is why I think that we shall
