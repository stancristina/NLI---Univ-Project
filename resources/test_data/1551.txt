overheard Mr Smith , an Englishman talking to Mr Rossi , an Italian .
Mr President , in order to explain the reasons for my declaration with reservations in favour of the Evans report , I would like , this time , to tell you about a conversation between Carlo and Fran√ßois .
I put it to you once again , Mr President : is this not also a State aid which should be included in the survey ?
Well , none of this has been achieved .
Well , I am going to give you a few references .
Are we not going to jeopardise the common economic and employment policy ?
Mr President , in countries with a high level of technological development , the protection of privacy is always more at risk , and therefore appropriate safeguards must be established .
Over months of work and with the constant assistance of the Commission , we have attempted - and we can inform you that we have been successful - to produce a detailed regulation responding to the concerns voiced by the Council and by the Parliamentary committees responsible for assessing the regulation and formulating opinions .
The willingness of all the institutions concerned to discuss the matter resulted in exemplary cooperation which , it is my fervent hope , will make it possible for us to reach a consensus at the first reading .
Moreover , provision has been made for an autonomous budget heading , in accordance with the prevailing system for the European Ombudsman , in order to provide a greater guarantee of the independence of the Data Protection Supervisor .
Effectively , the problem arises from the exclusions and exceptions in the protection of personal data with regard to the second and , in particular , third , pillars , but also from the exceptions already laid down by the directives as regards police activities and activities related to national security .
Mr President , we value the work carried out by Mr Bowis because , in addition to placing the subject in the right context , it raises important questions to which solutions must be found in the course of time .
Lastly , the intention to identify priority actions and class them in order of importance is certainly positive .
I would like to end by thanking all the political groups - the Group of the European People 's Party and European Democrats , the Group of the Party of European Socialists , the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance - for accepting a joint amendment initially tabled by Mr Fiori and myself which gives greater meaning to the very existence of the European authority .
Indeed , despite the fact that the creation of the European Food Safety Agency and the definition of its competencies are a fundamental point of the strategy proposed by the Commission , they are not the only point .
However , it is also necessary to call for a balanced approach to the issue because Articles 152 and 153 of the Treaty on European Union provide , as a general rule , for a high level of protection of human health and of consumers .
Mr President , developing an independent European Food Safety Agency is a major objective which must be achieved in conjunction with the national structures responsible for monitoring .
Far from it .
I would just like to mention a few of these points which , with regard to Parliament 's proposal , seem important and , in any case , represent a tangible step forward in this matter .
We will come to the political side of the report later .
Both the report and the opinions of the Committees , which we are presenting today , stress the driving role played by Parliament and the European Union in the abolition of landmines and in the provision of financial aid to the UN.
Europe must find a way to ensure that these stockpiles are eliminated from history but linger in our memories as a reminder that we must stop killing people with our lethal products .
We in this Parliament discuss tyre pressures and the length of vehicles , but we have not yet succeeded in grasping how important it is for there to be a common regulation throughout the 15 Member States establishing a decent minimum pension .
And yet there are so many urgent issues to be dealt with : 1 ) the need to define an economic policy which will rescue the euro from the stagnant depths to which it has plunged and boost employment ; 2 ) the need to attract investment to the Union in order to break out of the economic slump ; 3 ) the need to revise employment regulations to make the market more dynamic and more responsive ; or 4 ) the need to define a common line for a coherent diplomatic action to safeguard peace in the Middle East , etc .
All of these issues are extremely important and urgent in terms of the Union 's future and the function which it ought to be performing in the world .
How could the Pensioners ' Party not be pro-Europe , since it is the only party which is represented solely at the European Parliament and not in the national States ?
I therefore hope that we will opt in the near future for closer cooperation between certain States - including Italy - so that we can adopt common rules for the management of pensions and workers ' pension contributions .
These islands must be able to feel that they are an active part of the European Union , and I hope that the Union will turn them into a paradise both for tourists and for their inhabitants .
