a successful year in running euro monetary policy .
Clearly what matters is internal price stability , and the external value of the euro is of much less significance .
Indeed that was one of the reasons for creating the euro in the first place : it was precisely to protect the European economy from the volatility of the foreign exchanges to which Mr Goebbels has just referred .
I am particularly pleased , too , that Mr Duisenberg has reiterated his promise to publish forecasts and econometric models , and I entirely understand his caveats .
I hope that when he publishes the macroeconometric model he will do so in a form which makes it available and easily usable by outside researchers , perhaps on CD-ROM.
However , in connection with Parliament 's view of last year I would urge Mr Duisenberg to reconsider a formal framework for the publication of summary minutes .
As he said , much of the debate which happens within the Council is filtering out in the form of discussion within the monthly bulletin , but this is not the same as a regular report with a formal framework in which it is discussed .
That would help anchor expectations within the market , as well as fulfilling the important accountability mandate of the ECB.
It is also clearly crucial the ECB should look only at the euro zone as a whole in terms of its inflation and price stability objective .
It is essential to point out that different growth trends exist within the different national components of the euro zone economy , and that this implies different sustainable wage growth rates over time .
That is why it is important that there should be an overall discussion of what potential sustainable growth rates of wages are in each of the component parts of the euro zone economy , and why this will actually help deliver low inflation combined with low unemployment .
Those are the main points I would like to make .
I would also very much like to back Mr Goebbels ' remarks about the importance of enlargement , namely that we should not have two standards - one for us and one for them .
I very much hope that we will continue to apply the criteria of the Treaty , no more and no less .
Mr President , the Radwan report has addressed honestly many of the issues which relate to the functioning of the Central Bank , ranging from prudential banking supervision and the cost of international money transfers on the one hand , to convergence requirements for applicant countries and the role of this Parliament in providing the framework for the accountability of the ECB on the other .
I welcome the calls for greater transparency which I consider is the bank 's best defence against calls to amend the Treaty to reduce its operational independence , and Mr Duisenberg has undertaken to publish the econometric models , for which he should be congratulated .
I would also urge publishing the minutes and the voting patterns of the Governing Council , as winning the trust and the confidence of the markets is vital , especially for such a young institution .
The report welcomes the fact the ECB does not interpret its responsibility for stability policy one-sidedly , but that , in addition to inflation , it also monitors deflationary tendencies .
This is also important .
We all value economic and price stability , and the new paradigm in the United States gives us hope that such stability , including a balanced budget over the economic cycle , is consistent with growth and the steady reduction in unemployment .
The report , however , does not examine the markets ' lack of confidence in the euro and the huge capital outflows from Europe over the past year .
I believe this is due to the lack of faith in the core Euroland countries ' ability to govern and deliver fundamental structural reforms under their current governments , which Otmar Issing , the bank 's chief economist , has referred to as the serious structural rigidities in Europe 's labour markets and pensions systems .
Lastly , as a British member , I do not think it is fair that candidate countries should be subject to any stricter application of the Maastricht convergence criteria for joining EMU than the existing members and , as an out-country member , I urge the Commission to consider the flexible European model that we British Conservatives have adopted , allowing these countries to opt out of EMU in future if they so wish after joining .
Mr President , in many ways it has been a rather grim year for the euro .
I take a rather more pessimistic view than the previous speaker .
We have seen the external value of the euro plummet .
The interesting issue is to look at why that fall has happened .
There are many reasons which have been explored today , but a big reason is that the markets do not believe in a currency without a country .
They do not believe in a currency which is not backed by a political institution or a government .
This is a very good illustration of the inherent link between economic and monetary union and political union .
The one follows almost inevitably from the other .
That is one of the many reasons why the United Kingdom should stay out of the euro .
But what is vital is that the people across Europe have a debate about the future , a debate about political union .
Too often in the past they have been told that changes in Europe are technical .
Particularly the idea that a move to the euro was merely an economic choice is , quite frankly , a lie
