Foreign Affairs Committee , we have been sufficiently constructive , however , as to think also about how a medium-term solution might possibly be found in a situation where negotiations with the Council were taking place .
For if the Council definitely wants these appropriations to appear in the Council ' s budget , there is , of course , the possibility of the Council ' s , in return , entering into a type of inter-institutional agreement with ourselves here in Parliament , whereby the Council promises to give us the same information , control , inspection facilities etc as if the appropriations had appeared in the Commission ' s budget .
That is , therefore , the Foreign Affairs Committee ' s constructive contribution , and I should like to add that we , of course , also insist that , whenever anything new is adopted concerning the common foreign and security policy - be it in terms of expenditure or of initiatives - the Council must inform the European Parliament .
I do not think that it , in fact , is .
Proceeding from that point of view and inspired , in fact , by the EU directives , we in Denmark have begun a complete liberalisation of the electricity sector .
When you talk with them about liberalisation , they say , ' We are happy to have liberalisation , but it should be the same for everyone in Europe . '
We have obtained liberalisation in 15 different markets and15 different countries , but we have not in that way obtained complete liberalisation .
Employees in the sector shake their heads , and ordinary consumers do not obtain the intended benefits of liberalisation .
Of course we should have liberalisation , but it should be on equal terms .
At the same time , it is important to remember that liberalisation ought not to be carried out in isolation .
In future work on liberalising the energy market , we shall make sure that energy policy as a whole is involved .
I am thinking here of consumers , the environment , competitiveness , renewable energy sources and the employees .
Pages 60 and 61 of the ECB' s annual report contain a discussion of the situation in Denmark in 1999 .
This situation has , unfortunately , changed because there has been pressure on the Danish krone in recent months .
If there is , in fact , a 'no ' vote in this referendum - and I very much disagree with my French colleague who has just spoken and who , if I understood him correctly , is hoping for just such a vote - then speculation against the krone may be expected to increase , in which case Denmark will have need of that ECB support in defence of the krone which is provided for in the ERM 2 agreement .
Firstly , what conditions must Denmark fulfil before the ECB will intervene in support of the krone ?
Secondly , how much in the way of foreign reserves will the ECB , in practice , spend on buying up kroner in order to support and defend the Danish currency ?
Thirdly , for how long a period will the ECB be prepared to support the krone ?
I am glad that no money from the campaign is formally being used for propaganda in the Danish debate .
It could form part of a handbook for democrats or perhaps , rather , be used as an object lesson in anti-democratic manipulation .
It is also noted that there is no overwhelming support for the euro in the euro area and certainly not in the countries surrounding this area .
Or , to put it another way : the objective , as stated in the report itself , is that " the right means of communication can be used to respond to the European public ' s national and cultural features " .
The situation is that , in this programme , more than EUR 100 million has been used to influence the people of Europe .
That is to say , the Commission is using Europeans ' money to manipulate Europeans .
As I see it , that is the very opposite of how we really visualise this project .
If I say this , it is because , as is well known , we are holding a referendum in Denmark on 28 September on joining the euro , and it goes without saying that it is the public debate which forms the basis for this .
Such tellingly described manipulation has not been seen since the totalitarian regimes collapsed years ago .
My political Group and the intergroup SOS Democracy therefore recommend that we postpone the vote and give the agreement a proper reading in all committees , especially in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the Committee on Budgetary Control .
Now , the Commission is being given the opportunity to decide what it will hand over for inspection .
The framework agreement also contravenes our own rules of procedure .
Article 64 requires express equality between the Council and Parliament in the legislative procedure when the Commission transfers documents .
Now , it is only the President of the Parliament and the committee chairmen who are entitled to see different types of non-public documents .
As MEPs , we ought to be legally entitled to have documents made available to us whenever they have been issued to others by the Commission .
Now , a compromise is being proposed whereby those who are to be inspected can decided what they will have inspected .
I would therefore urge that we reject the proposal today and arrange for it to be improved so that we can vote for an improved version next time .
