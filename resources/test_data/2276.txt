this interest .
We will monitor compliance with the recommendations of the resolution we are debating today .
The proposal divides the territory of the States into statistical units organised hierarchically into three levels , and proposes criteria for the definition of these regions in the candidate countries , criteria which demand that they continue to be defined on the basis of territorial organisation and within the current demographic borders .
I still believe that the Commission ' s proposal should have been more daring , more coherent and , perhaps , if you will allow me , more European .
Its acceptance could prevent a second reading and a conciliation procedure and would allow the Regulation to enter into force on 1 January 2002 .
We are dealing here with an example of what , in many cases , this way of operating has consisted of : gentlemen' s agreements .
I would lastly like to point out an amendment which rather reflects what we are talking about : the amendment by Mrs Cerdeira on the division of the cities of Ceuta and Melilla , which are politico-administrative units , each with its own status .
Nor does this document in any way prejudice regional policy : we do not know who will be objective 1 , who will be objective 2 or whether the current regional policy system will be the same in the future .
Our document is essentially based on three principles .
But we are also aware that there are historic realities and legal situations in each of the countries which mean that this principle cannot be applied in an automatic or mechanical way , and that specific situations have to be taken into account .
It would be very difficult to establish political interests which undoubtedly would lead us to clear contradictions .
The Commission can therefore accept the 11 amendments presented by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism .
The European Union can play an important role in this context .
My political family is also trying to re-establish links and the new tour of the Middle East which you have announced is very important , with an active approach by the Union to the resolution of this absolutely key conflict .
On behalf of my group , I can tell you that we have two concerns : one , that there should be balanced representation between European parliamentarians and those of the Member States , both in the Convention and in the Presidency ; secondly , that the Convention should make a difference and not just be a talking shop or a debating club , and should make coherent proposals .
Mr President , justice is a key word on the European and international stages following 11 September .
I am grateful for the information on the elimination of double incrimination , because - as the Chairman of my group , Mr Bar√≥n , said - this House feels that the effort we make to keep up with circumstances is not always reflected in the Council .
Mr President , I will end by saying that none of these instruments being provided to the judicial administration of the Member States imply the least restriction of the civil liberties of European citizens , but quite the opposite : they provide additional means for protecting the freedom which those who use terrorism to try to impose their ideas take away from the individual .
We must consolidate this .
We are awaiting the Council meeting on the 30 October , from which we want a unanimous position from the Council with regard to the Belgian proposal on taxation , in order to bring about the statute of Members once and for all ; we also believe that the package of anti-terrorist measures is a great opportunity to demonstrate to our co-citizens that we are united .
Mr President , the golden age of the General Affairs Council has passed and it seems unrealistic to believe that the European Council is prepared to reinstate the powers which it has taken away from it .
The Poos report has the merit of proposing to the Council some minimal reforms , which are likely to lead to a process of self-reform which is becoming increasingly essential .
Only by extending freedom , human rights and development can we recover our security .
In return , Parliament and the parliamentary delegation which will accompany him to Qatar will offer him all their support .
I am thinking specifically of the textile industry , which has strictly respected its commitment to open up its market , increasing quotas and progressively increasing the application of the GATT rules in the sector , which is something that not all countries have done , including the most developed countries .
Europe is strong when united , but when fragmented is weak .
But we will have to start - and I am convinced of this - by creating a true common EU foreign and security policy with a common conscience that is efficient , coherent and visible , as Mr Brok ' s report recommends .
Lastly , it is very important that the European Union should play a role in the Middle East and in the Western Sahara , and we are also wasting this opportunity .
First of all , it ceases to class as crimes actions that are still crimes because they fulfil the conditions as such .
This is even more the case , Mr President , where a Sakharov Prize winner , Mrs Leyla Zana , remains in gaol , and we must continue to strongly demand that she be freed .
On the other hand , under the Ottoman Empire , the Greek monasteries , the Sufis and the Sephardis all survived .
We have to contribute to the strengthening of this strategy and its improvement , with European ideas used in governance
