in the ultraperipheral regions .
The Commission accepts the vast majority of the proposed amendments , with some changes to the wording in certain cases .
Once again , I would like to thank Parliament for supporting this proposal , Mr Beysen for his work , and all the speakers , and I hope we will also achieve a swift solution in the Council .
Mr President , I shall end by referring to the role of the Members of the European Parliament in these summits which - as the Commissioner so rightly said - should be substantial , but not because we want to be present in every single discussion , but because I believe we can be of help to the Commission and to those who are determined that the Kyoto Protocol should become reality .
Therefore , in the absence of detailed studies , does the Commission not think that the precautionary principle of maintaining the moratorium in place should prevail ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , at its meeting today the Commission adopted a series of measures which , within the framework of the Euratom Treaty , are aimed at achieving a Community approach to the management of nuclear waste and nuclear safety .
Secondly , it must be said that , in the negotiations with the candidate countries , we are demanding that the candidate countries comply with certain obligations and behave in a certain way , in the field of nuclear safety , which cannot be compared with anything in the current countries of the Union .
The first relates to increasing safety in nuclear power stations and the issue of their dismantling .
How can we guarantee to all the citizens that the required standards will be complied with in all the nuclear installations of the European Union ?
We therefore propose a series of elements , but essentially the externalisation of these funds or an equivalent means of guaranteeing their availability to prevent them from , for example , in the event of bankruptcy , being included in the bankrupt assets and therefore not being available for their objective of dismantling the installations when the time comes .
We are establishing the possibility that the underground storage of this radioactive waste can be carried out in a manner which involves cooperation between different Member States of the Union .
Furthermore , this may open up the possibility for us - and let us hope this is the case - to be able to demand and promote the speedy closure of the oldest nuclear reactors in Russia , some of which may clearly at some point cause problems and which are very close to us .
We have demanded that the candidate countries comply with them and what we are going to do is simply demand that the current countries of the Union do the same .
In principle , all countries are obliged to take responsibility for their own nuclear waste .
We are proposing the opposite .
That is the problem we have to resolve .
The majority of appropriations have already been used and even paid back by the borrowers of the loans .
With regard to the question of the Swedish example , I am not going to insist on the issue of joint storage .
This debate cannot therefore ignore public opinion .
And , for the future , they were very worried about the reports they were going to have to present periodically .
We are all dismayed and we all share in the pain of the families of the victims .
Why is the problem of safety being raised ?
We have in fact held a working meeting with Mr Giscard d'Estaing , but we have not raised the issue of the review of the Euratom Treaty .
I would like to say that , in making this proposal , what I am doing above all is following up a decision of this Parliament , and I am delighted , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , to be in agreement with Parliament and to be able to comply with an almost unanimous request by this House .
Therefore , as far as the citizens are concerned , we will increase what we have to increase , I believe : guarantees , confidence , information , transparency .
I would like to say , ladies and gentlemen , that in no way have I ignored the issue of renewable energy and energy efficiency .
With regard to technologies , a package for research and its promotion is proposed .
With regard to the problem of unfair competition within the internal electricity market , Article 11 and the corresponding Annex , which clearly establish that the funds for dismantling can only be used expressly for the purposes laid down , that is , when the time comes , for the dismantling of the relevant energy installations , something which is unfortunately not the case today in several countries of the Union , but rather these funds enter into the general assets of the companies and can therefore be used for any operational purpose .
And if you will allow me , Mr President , leaving aside something that we must debate in plenary session at the second reading in November , which is the state of the negotiations and the conditions for each candidate country , I will mention an important issue , that of funding , with a prior warning : I clearly support President Cox in his criticisms of all the governments - beginning with the Presidency - in relation to their continued treatment since Nice of the allocation of seats in the European Parliament .
We cannot .
There are now ten .
Are we going to continue working ?
We will have to hold a serious debate on this issue .
