of the previous Commission , and the 1997 accounts are just as incriminating .
As far as the decision to balance the accounts is concerned , we shall abstain from voting , and where , finally , the motion for a resolution is concerned , we shall attach most importance to the many correct instructions contained in this and vote in favour of it .
Mr President , the Commission is now to obtain its discharge for 1997 , but in reality it does not deserve it . 1997 was a matter for the old Commission and , therefore , the new Commission does not think that it can accept liability .
The new Commission has , on the other hand , undertaken to carry out a cleaning up exercise following former scandals , and I must admit that I am not impressed at all .
There are some who think that it is more in our interests to let bygones be bygones and make a fresh start .
I am referring here especially to the earlier scandals involving ECHO .
I am the rapporteur for ECHO on the Committee on Budgetary Control , and I shall have a lot of difficulty carrying out my work if the Commission will not give me the necessary information .
From the outside , it looks as if the Commission has something to hide .
My investigations also unfortunately suggest that this could be the case .
It was this practice which led to the Commission ' s downfall .
Otherwise , we cannot carry out our work .
Mr President , a couple of years ago , the previous Commission tried once and for all to tackle rigid and obsolescent structures .
This was stupid of the old Commission , and Parliament was of no help on that occasion .
There are too many rights , too many regulations and too little room for leadership .
Where is the beef ?
And I would also say this to you , Commissioner : please , deliver the beef even if it is British .
Romano Prodi promised a revolution .
Sort out the tangle of staff allowances .
Ensure too , that training becomes a management tool .
It is the posts which should possibly be made permanent and not necessarily those employed on a temporary basis .
We have not done this so far , and this is something you ought to be instrumental in changing .
Mr President , I should very much like to thank the rapporteur for his splendid report .
The process of reform has been going on for some time , and something like a state of emergency seems to prevail in the Commission .
The Commission ' s administration simply does not function particularly well .
Naturally , there are good , capable employees in the Commission , and they are in the majority .
There is too little action and too much unnecessary bureaucracy .
The Financial Regulation should be amended .
It is just a question of how .
We should be careful about this .
It is not enough simply to carry out spot checks once the money has been spent .
Instead , we should be reforming and decentralising control .
The Commission does not have enough staff .
As Members of the European Parliament , we must have the courage to explain to our governments and people back home that the Commission ' s staff resources are not at all adequate for the tasks which have been assigned to it .
The staffing system is too rigid .
It should also be much easier to sack inefficient and incompetent employees .
After all , the very bad experiences so far with disciplinary proceedings show all too clearly how necessary it is that we carry out reforms .
The two identical-sounding questions which are under discussion are , of course , underpinned by a mantra of the kind which , in recent years , has increasingly transformed politics into a type of ideology - fine-sounding , but pernicious .
Behind this lies another ambition on the part of the Commission and of the Council and of the overwhelming majority of this House , namely to introduce such an area .
The problem is just that this is not something the EU can introduce by means of legislative decrees and other supranational resolutions .
Freedom , security and justice are the root system of any society , reflecting its history , corporate experience and political development .
A system of this kind is not something the EU can introduce without society ' s sustaining damage as a result .
The agenda is not designed to secure justice for the citizen .
The agenda is designed to transfer vital parts of society ' s criminal law , policy on crime and administration of justice to the EU' s control .
You just have to think of all the resolutions concerning Fort Europa , Schengen , Eurodac etc .
First of all , the initiatives which have been planned are completely unrealistic .
Think of last year ' s deadly criticism of the Commission ' s lack of propriety , ethics and accountability .
But , secondly , the projects will put a strain on , indeed will be injurious to , the national democracies .
As long as the EU revolved around the internal market , only the body was being attacked .
Now , it is the soul .
I am , up to a point , concerned about how the Council will fight for the principles contained in the Treaty of Amsterdam and whose purpose is to ensure that citizens have a better opportunity to participate in the decision-making process .
Does not the Council ' s representative think that this makes it difficult to participate in the democratic decision-making process ?
Mr President , the President of the Commission was not being quite honest when he talked last week about the Intergovernmental Conference .
