We must resolve matters through states , by creating another Palestinian State .
A day , a week , a month ?
And under whose control have we placed it ?
I look forward to the time when I , the Israelis and the Palestinians will have the right to citizenship which is not your or our prisons .
The Commissioner cannot establish it as the main priority .
Mr President , in our view , the Roadmap represents , at all events , a chance of peace which must be pursued over and above any feelings of like or dislike .
On this matter , I agree with the French Foreign Minister , Mr De Villepin , when he said that Mr Berlusconi 'had not satisfied the European position' , which is one of wisdom , of dialogue with all .
It is inevitable that globalisation of the markets should facilitate the decentralisation of many traditional activities towards developing countries , where production costs are lower .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this recommendation for second reading on the Council common position on the proposal to amend the ' Seveso directive ' warrants a brief synopsis of its history .
In the sensitive climate of the tragic accidents which have affected the chemical industry and , in particular , the communities living in the areas surrounding these sites , as well as the environment , the Commission presented to Parliament and the Council its proposal to amend Directive 96/8 2/EC of 9 December 1996 , which lays down provisions , of course , on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances .
We are aware that the Commission has , just recently , launched a specific proposal for a directive on the management of waste from mining activities , the terms of which will , moreover , have to be decided together with the European Parliament at the appropriate time , but , until then , there is and will continue to be a gap in the law which , given the recent accidents which have alarmed public opinion , cannot be tolerated .
However , given the great diversity of rules , regional situations , competences and responsibilities which characterises this aspect of safety - situating plant in terms of urban development planning - I believe that we must , of necessity , invoke the principle of subsidiarity and leave it up to the Member States to decide on the minimum distances .
I remain confident , however , that , with a constructive debate , it will be possible to achieve a solution which ensures maximum safety in these plants .
There are many positive aspects of the communication , such as , for example , the delegation to the Member States of responsibility for managing coastal fishing , the involvement of fishermen 's associations , dialogue with third countries and the consideration given for the first time to leisure fishing .
The second point is the emphasis placed on the fundamental role of research to support an effective fisheries policy .
It appears to us to be somewhat incomplete in that it does not acknowledge that fishermen are more often victims of , rather than responsible for , environmental damage .
Quite right .
We must make every endeavour to support the small-scale fishing , the traditional fishing which , in addition to providing a vital source of employment for countless families , is the guardian of an age-old tradition which Europe must protect and safeguard .
In conclusion , Mr President , I support the line taken by Mr MacCormick , and I believe that , in acting in this way , Parliament will be setting a precedent for subsequent cases .
No one - neither the Court nor the Public Prosecution Department which has opened the proceedings relating to Mr Musotto - has applied to the European Parliament for authorisation : there has been no request or notification .
We are approaching second reading after overcoming a number of difficulties encountered recently with translations and amendments - even now , this evening , the facility for tabling amendments is open until 7 p.m ; in fact , it is about to close .
Debate , dialogue and the diversity of political positions and national interests have stimulated and shaped the conclusions .
However , since that cannot happen , a requirement has been proposed which , moreover , already exists indirectly , according to which the basic principles of the legislation must , at any event , always be observed , including by independent territorial legislation .
By respecting this principle we are consolidating qualitative competition too , which would otherwise be in danger of being squeezed out in a purely economic and technological context , being moreover the prerogative of the company alone and therefore not always beneficial to the contracting authority .
This principle is the basis for the rapporteur 's proposals .
The confidentiality of information which , according to the pre-established procedures , is provided to the contracting entity by the interested parties will be protected and safeguarded by specific rules .
All this is in the interests of the Union and in the interests of an internal market which must become increasingly consolidated and transparent .
The reform of our common agricultural policy also deserves a special mention , the agreement last week bringing these six months to a close on a high note .
As for the actual draft Constitution , there are positive and negative points in the Commission 's eyes , as you know .
When it comes to the institutions , moreover , it will be difficult to convince the citizens that only half of the Commissioners should have a vote in the College , at least in such a complex phase in our institutional life as this .
We are approaching the last year of the Commission 's term of office .
