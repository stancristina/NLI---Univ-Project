start or whether we will be joining later .
I look forward to meeting Parliament again following the Gothenburg Summit , where I hope we will be able to say that we have taken a step forward on enlargement , even though a great deal of work will remain to be done on that point .
We consider that with an increased budget and the foundation of a new Health Coordination and Monitoring Centre , the Trakatellis report is heading in such a direction .
It is a great honour to be able to talk to you today .
Studies clearly show that judicial cooperation is close to the heart of European citizens .
In the Treaty of Amsterdam and the conclusions from the Tampere Summit the EU has put forward a very ambitious plan for how we are to succeed in achieving an area of freedom , security and justice .
Often there is an intimate link between issues falling under the first and third pillars .
In that year the Justice and Home Affairs Council passed around twenty legal instruments , eight of which were regulations and three conventions .
Decisions were reached in several important areas in terms of combating economic crime .
A decision was passed on protection of the Euro , and at the joint meeting of JHA/Ecofin in Luxembourg on 17 October , a number of important decisions were adopted , e.g . concerning money laundering .
Furthermore , we succeeded in developing the principle of mutual recognition by adopting a programme of measures regarding mutual recognition of judgments in criminal cases .
Mr President , part of the question asked concerns the dialogue between the institutions and the measures which have been planned to make this dialogue more efficient and more clearly define the relationship between the institutions , the Member States and , for example , Europol and Eurojust .
The institutions have partly taken on new roles and the way they work is being redesigned .
The Council is fully aware that the ambitious work in this area also means a considerable workload for you in Parliament .
The Swedish Presidency has begun discussions on the way the Council works .
Such an improvement would make the joint work of the institutions much easier .
There may be measures which can be taken in the short term and which may not require any regulatory changes .
Where this issue , too , is concerned , I would like , however , to emphasise that we must consider the opportunity of further improving conditions for Parliament to gain access .
The mutual recognition of judgments in criminal cases and traditional judicial cooperation have the same purpose : for cooperation between Member States to improve such that we can achieve an area of freedom , security and justice .
The principle of mutual recognition as expressed in the programme of measures covers decisions before the judgment , the judgment itself and decisions after the judgment .
When the instrument was presented , it was received positively , and negotiations will begin this spring during the Swedish Presidency .
During the spring it is likely that initiatives concerning mutual recognition and enforcement of fines will be submitted .
A European Enforcement Order , unlike a national one , could be enforced in all Member States without any inter-state control .
A number of instruments which we agreed on at the end of the 1990s have already been able to enter into force .
One concrete example is what is known as the Brussels II Regulation on the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters .
Some form of control of implementation may be one way of putting pressure on all of us to really fulfil our undertakings .
Mr President , honourable Members of the European Parliament , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to begin by thanking you for also giving me the opportunity to take part in this annual debate .
Work to develop a common asylum and immigration policy is important for several reasons .
We will jointly be able to confirm international undertakings and values such as solidarity , human rights and legal protection .
The Commission has worked intensively and many proposals have been presented in the past year .
The Member States have applied for funding from this fund for 2000 and 2001 for various projects focusing on reception , integration and repatriation .
At the last meeting of the Council on 15 - 16 March , the Council was also able to pass the decision that Norway and Iceland be linked to the Dublin Convention and Eurodac.
I hope that - before the Swedish Presidency is over - we will be able to add to this list of decisions on Community rules directives on temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons and on the right to family reunification .
When it comes to temporary protection , experience from Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo show that we have to take joint , united responsibility next time the Union receives a massive influx of displaced persons .
We also hope to be able to reach agreement at the Council meeting in May on mutual recognition of expulsion orders .
The Council has also addressed two proposals , one directive and the framework decision on common rules for combating trafficking in human beings and assisting people to reside illegally in our countries .
The Swedish Presidency is currently investigating conditions for achieving political agreement .
In Lisbon we discussed , among other things , how we are to follow up the Tampere Summit on the basis of the Commission ' s scoreboard .
During the past year , on several occasions , we have seen pictures of tragedies in conjunction with people attempting to enter our countries .
