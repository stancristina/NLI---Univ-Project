Preventing the financing of terrorism and tracking clues that such transactions may leave behind can both prevent terrorist crimes and be important in the investigation of such crimes .
In recent years , information from the TFTP has contributed to revealing and investigating terrorist crimes and has also succeeded in preventing terrorist attacks on European soil .
Since SWIFT is moving its database from the US to Europe at the end of the year , it is essential that the EU concludes a short-term agreement with the US as soon as possible so that there is no risk of the exchange of information being interrupted .
If the TFTP is to be of use to the EU and the Member States , the US must continue to provide the respective authorised authorities within the EU with information from the TFTP in the same way as previously .
At the same time , we are clear that the interim agreement must contain the necessary mechanisms to guarantee the protection of individuals ' privacy , the rule of law and data protection .
The draft agreement therefore contains a provision stating that there must be a separate EU authority to receive , process and approve any request from the US to obtain information from SWIFT.
Allow me to mention certain other provisions that we will demand are included in the agreement .
Neither the US nor the EU may use the system to investigate other kinds of crime or for other purposes .
The task of the appraisal body will be to check compliance with the agreement , to check the correct application of the provisions on data protection and to check that the transfer of data is proportionate .
Mr President , thank you for these important points of view .
Secondly , the draft agreement mentions an appraisal body , which I described to you , and also the Presidency , the Commission and representatives of national data protection authorities , the involvement of which is intended to check that the matter is dealt with correctly .
Naturally , this restricts how the information can be used .
However , the US is keen to be able to use this tool in its fight against terrorism and we also think the equivalent information would be useful to us .
That is what I have attempted to describe .
However , I have tried to describe our starting point and the clear mandate that we have from the Council .
Mr President , I am delighted to have the opportunity to present one of the main priorities of the Swedish Presidency - the development of the strategy for the Baltic Sea area .
Naturally , Sweden and the other countries neighbouring the Baltic have a great interest in the strategy for the area , but we also believe it could serve as a model for other regions and other regional strategies that would be useful to the entire EU.
By working across borders and between different sectors in a particular region , we can deal collectively and more effectively with common challenges such as pollution and environmental destruction .
The proposed strategy for the Baltic Sea area is the result of a request made by the European Council to the Commission in December 2007 and the initiative was supported by the European Parliament in a resolution of 12 December 2007 .
Getting to grips with the environmental issues is , of course , one of the main priorities .
In particular , overfertilisation and algal blooms caused by excess nutrient run-off are threatening the ecological equilibrium of the Baltic Sea .
The economic crisis has made the matter of jobs and growth highly topical .
We want the internal market to function better in our region than anywhere else , and we want the new Lisbon strategy for jobs and growth to be implemented effectively in this part of Europe .
Rather , we are endeavouring to use the instruments and policy areas that already exist such that together , they benefit the area in a more strategically coordinated and intelligent way .
We deserve a cleaner Baltic Sea at the centre of an area that offers prospects for sustainable economic development across borders , supported by the entire EU.
It is only natural that we should be supported by the European Parliament , because in fact you were the founding fathers of the whole idea of a strategy for the Baltic Sea area and I am pleased that you are also going to ensure that this strategy becomes a reality .
One hundred million people live in this region .
There is a great deal of support in civil society and among the municipalities around the Baltic Sea for us to achieve this .
EUR 55 million has been earmarked for the region under the existing budgetary framework .
We also know that we can hope for contributions from international institutions such as the EIB , which has shown great interest in the Baltic Sea region .
There is a project that involves strengthening the training of customs and police officers in the region in order to be better able to identify and work on the issue of trafficking .
There are also other partnerships in the Baltic region .
That was an old decision that already existed from the time of Lithuania 's accession negotiations .
The Baltic Sea Strategy is an internal EU strategy .
We are looking forward to the conference tomorrow and on Friday and are pleased that Vice-President Wallis is coming to Stockholm .
We hope to be able to move forward in the discussion , although it is a little too early to set actual timetables at present .
It was thanks to the Czech Presidency that we managed to bring about quickly such successful cooperation between the Council and Parliament , as well
