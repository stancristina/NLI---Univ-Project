, on the one hand , compulsory expenditure and , on the other , non-compulsory expenditure , and with the prospect of pure codecision before us , this is an exercise that I feel demands our full attention , and I believe that Mr Wathelet , Secretary of State for the Budget , will be anxious to do a good job .
The next step must be to revive the real economy , and the European Commission has presented the relevant texts and plans .
Therefore , the EU must provide the right answer to the negative social consequences we are experiencing as a result of the crisis , which started as a financial crisis and has ended up as a crisis of the real economy , and is also being seen on the labour market .
One specific characteristic of my country is that , both at the federal level and at the regional level , our governments are composed of numerous parties .
First of all , I should like to emphasise , as you have also pointed out in your most recent resolution on the enlargement strategy , that enlargement has been a success story for the EU and for Europe as a whole and that it has brought benefits to both long-standing and new Member States .
In addition , Iceland needs to take action on the other weak areas to which the Commission referred in its Opinion , including financial services .
If confirmed , this timetable would enable us to start accession negotiations before the summer recess .
Enlargement is decided by merit rather than by an artificial timetable .
The Althing , the Icelandic Parliament , is the oldest parliament on our continent .
Madam President , I wish to thank the rapporteur , Mr Preda , who has mentioned the good cooperation between the European Parliament , the Commission and the Council , cooperation which the rotating Presidency very much values .
At present , we do not have a level playing field between Member States .
I am referring here to the coordination between national supervisors .
That objective should not become entangled with supervision .
On the subject of grotesque perversions , I should add that another practice in evidence today is that of hiring hit men to allow blood feuds to rage on without bounds .
The Commission is now talking about a moratorium , about supervising the supervisory authorities and about responsibility for good governance .
Can the international community or the European Union offer any perspective in this social climate of impunity , in which both the Kyrgyz and Uzbek communities regard themselves as victims par excellence of a veritable orgy of murderous violence ?
To conclude , I would urge the Council and the Commission to pay attention to the fundamental right of religious freedom in Kyrgyzstan .
I will look at a couple of key words , starting with stigma .
If we simply recognised those principles and notions , and if we had the support of all the Members in this House , then we could already eliminate so much misery .
In addition , if you are practical , we are in the midst of an economic crisis which hits countries outside the European Union particularly .
We do not have the names of any dissidents or activists in the territory of North Korea .
Madam President , officially North Korea claims that it guarantees religious freedom to its population of 24 million .
Both this regulation itself and its quality will benefit air traffic in Europe and also air traffic safety .
Nevertheless , the overall package represents a real step forward .
The provision of information on passengers involved in an accident , in particular , is a great improvement , and for this reason , we shall not be abstaining from voting tomorrow but shall instead be supporting the rapporteur by voting in favour .
I have heard one of my fellow Members from the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) saying words to the effect of : ' How can we make these readmission agreements more attractive to those other countries ? '
Therefore , I find it distasteful to note that , now of all times , we are being required to take a decision on a readmission agreement that will inevitably mean that Europe is able to send back to Pakistan illegal asylum seekers and those whose applications have been rejected .
How does the Commission intend to do this ?
Healthy ecosystems fix CO2 , provide clean water and ensure better harvests and more raw materials , among other things .
Biodiversity should form part of not only European nature policy but also other policies , such as fisheries , agriculture and regional policy .
Yet our ambition should also include the restoration of biodiversity .
I should like to conclude by thanking the shadow rapporteurs for the constructive cooperation that resulted in the unanimous adoption of this report in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety , and also by thanking Commissioner Potoƒçnik , who cannot be here today as he is in New York , on biodiversity business .
Natura 2000 has seen major successes in many Member States .
Let those same ministers make their fine statements , and on those occasions keep their heads held high and show courage by making the right choices .
Mr President , I should like to thank my fellow Members for their contributions from a variety of angles .
Win-win situations are what this is all about , not least in financial terms .
What we have not discussed is Corporate Social Responsibility ( CSR ) , however , yet that also needs to be included in this discussion .
