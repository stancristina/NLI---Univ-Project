I have a couple of remarks relating to the use and re-use of public information .
One example that might be mentioned is the significant interest shown in Denmark in a certain mayor 's restaurant and travel bills .
Since everyone in Denmark has access to such documents , simply by asking to see them , there were too many people who asked to see them .
The documents were therefore posted on the Internet so that any citizen could see each and every original document there .
In Denmark , however , we do have access to this kind of information relating to such people and , in this connection , the Internet is used , and it is made available free of charge .
Why is this kind of data made available free of charge , and why is such use of the Internet encouraged ?
Firstly , the more that people do for themselves , the faster the responses they receive and the fewer civil servants we have to employ .
Data can be made available free of charge , moreover , because the public savings are as substantial as they are .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , the EU Summit is to meet ' His Imperial Highness ' Giscard d'Estaing , who is in the process of preparing a draft democratic constitution behind closed doors in a Praesidium in which four of Parliament 's seven political groups are not represented .
We have still not received a reply .
President Giscard d'Estaing has refused another request to scrutinise documentation on the grounds that EU rules on transparency do not apply to him .
I should like to call upon the Presidency to inform him politely but firmly that the Praesidium too is funded by EU taxpayers and must of course act in accordance with the judgments of the Court of Justice and the principle of transparency , which now appears in Article 255 of the Treaty .
In the case of every single document in the Praesidium 's possession , President Giscard d'Estaing must weigh up its significance in the negotiations against the public 's interest in knowing about it and , like everyone else in the EU , he must ensure that the principle of equality is practised .
We demand equality - neither more , nor less .
It must now be clear even to those least quick on the uptake that a constitution , and not merely a constitutional treaty , is being worked on .
All the political groups should be represented .
Thank you , Mr President , even though there is not very much to say thank you for .
- ( DA ) The June Movement has , as far as possible , voted in favour of the highest minimum requirements , but voted against whenever there has been a risk of undermining the Danish tax-funded welfare model with its social and civil liberties for all .
We have abstained from voting in this vote because of the above-mentioned conflict .
The proposal contains quite a few constructive elements for improving and simplifying application procedures , as well as for ensuring uniform rights for the persons concerned .
The ELDR Group is in favour of an environmentally friendly plan for traffic through the Alps , but such a plan must support the development of environmentally sound transport .
Some say that this is exclusively Saddam Hussein 's responsibility .
We too have a responsibility , namely to work out how much cooperation is required here and now in order to prevent a war .
When we were in Baghdad last week , the weapons inspectors made it quite clear that , if they were to continue to be present , Saddam Hussein could neither develop new weapons nor use those he already has .
We must give the weapons inspectors more time .
UNHCR has drawn attention to the fact that 100 000 Iraqis would die in the first 48 hours of a war .
There would be a danger of civil war .
I also think that this debate is too serious to be subordinated to domestic policy .
I therefore think it important also to get the Council and the Commission to follow up this very important matter of how best to emphasise to one 's partners , and in any future situation , that to use anti-personnel mines , cluster bombs and depleted uranium is to use weapons that strike indiscriminately , that hit civilian as well as non-civilian targets , that hit the innocent as well as the guilty and that can be dormant for a long time and only make themselves felt perhaps years after a possible war is over .
I therefore think the Council and the Commission should understand that , firstly , we must prevent these types of war crime from being committed .
There are , however , other places too in which this could be relevant .
That was the first aspect .
The second is to follow up those crimes that have already been committed .
We must also be prepared to apply them , and we must be prepared to apply the sanctions available to us at present .
Otherwise , we shall end up in a world in which only the strong make the decisions , in which only the strong can do as they see fit and in which weak countries are entirely subject to the diktat of a stronger power .
The resolution deals with those aspects we are discussing in Parliament and , in general , with what gives rise to the problems in the regions when we implement such dramatic decisions concerning certain fish stocks - in this case , cod in particular .
There must be a balance in the stocks .
The EU must therefore intervene and raise some of these problems .
In that connection , I should also like to draw attention
