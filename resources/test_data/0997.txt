which could be available before the end of the Treaty of Nice ratification period .
So that is also why I wished to thank you , as well as to thank you for the form and the content of the initiative you have taken .
Mr President , the Duhamel report , which I shall be discussing , once again raises the European Parliament ' s old idea of giving Europe a constitution .
As to the results it will achieve , a disappearing trick !
And that is where the jiggery-pokery becomes abuse .
In this case , as stated in my Group ' s Amendment No 37 , we should have to go back , in order to reach a decision , to the sovereign people and give the European Parliament that will be elected in 2004 a clear mandate for a constitution .
Everyone , or almost everyone , who has spoken has done so in support of this idea and we feel that this is already a huge victory .
What is the meaning of " the introduction of the opportunity to move towards retirement gradually , via part-time work " , if not a threat to the age of retirement , which is already far too high in many countries ?
A great many of us here would like to hear this stated by the Court of Luxembourg , which is the guardian of the law .
It would also be useful if the assessment showed how many redundancies they cause , because all the mergers that have been authorised by the Brussels Commission have led to restructuring or , in other words , redundancies .
She has asked me to send you her apologies and to speak on her behalf .
I view this as an outmoded approach .
Concerning the CAP , or heading 1 , the significant 6.3 % increase in appropriations is the result , as I have said , of the Berlin Agreements reforming the CAP.
Concerning large-scale multiannual programmes such as the FRDP , the Framework Research and Development Programme , the Council has respected the appropriation schedules approved by Parliament .
Concerning heading 5 , the rationale adopted by the Council consists of stabilising current expenditure at the level of inflation while also granting supplementary funds for exceptional expenditure by the institutions .
The solution would thus be to significantly increase the level of payment appropriations in order to pay all the commitments outstanding .
I think I can safely say that the Union was efficient in its financing of all the requirements connected with the Balkans in the year 2000 , as the Community Budget enabled us to swiftly respond , among other things , to the acceleration in the timetable for reconstruction in Kosovo .
The Council will spare no effort to meet the needs of the Balkans , not least by granting significant funding under the budget .
The third is intended to fund measures in preparation for a programme to combat drugs trafficking , and the fourth sets up the funding for actions to be carried out conjointly with third countries , primarily Morocco , with a view to better controlling the flow of immigration .
Jacques Chirac spoke lyrically , in this very Chamber , of the Europe of all citizens , male and female , yet the draft budget of the Fifteen envisages an absolute reduction in appropriations in chapters as important as social action , employment , education , training , youth , culture , audiovisual media and the environment .
There is one fact which must be noted , and which we must , as French Members of Parliament , deplore , and that is that the Council has failed with regard to one of the traditional responsibilities of French politics , its responsibility to the farmers of Europe , with a cut of more than half a billion euros in heading 1 .
It is possible to make substantial savings , either by saving the monies arising from the under implementation of certain programmes , or by the European Union ' s at last taking a decision to stop using budget lines for the purposes of pro-Europe propaganda .
There will be a ministerial meeting , firstly , in Sochaux , on 23 November , and there specifically we shall have a debate on institutional reform in the context of an enlarged Europe , and on the second occasion , on the morning of the 7 December at the European Council in Nice .
They must , of course , pass local information back to their government , but the question here was to find a solution to a situation where fourteen Member States had taken measures with regard to the fifteenth for the political reasons that are familiar to you .
I am not unaware of amount of money the Americans are promising in aid for Colombia , for example , the bulk of which is earmarked for activities to combat drugs trafficking .
Let me make myself clear .
This movement raises fundamental questions , such as the respective roles of man and the world of finance in today ' s economy .
The real question I have , then , does not concern the objectives of the Tobin tax , i .e . regulation of the exchange markets , making these markets more ethical by using them to fund development , but rather on our ability to ensure that these mechanisms are effective .
Just as much as in the case of the Tobin tax , the debate is ongoing .
We do have to consider a number of questions calling for specific answers , particularly on the subject of funding development , and clearly efforts must focus on the improvement and the quality of state aid for development , the development of trade , strengthening international financial institutions , and the issue of debt must be considered in depth once again .
