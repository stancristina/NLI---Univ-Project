It is you 20 who are responsible for the fact that we , as Members of Parliament , are still not receiving the information we request .
You operate on the principles of absolute monarchy .
Come out into the open and acknowledge that it is no longer possible to govern with old-fashioned secrecy .
You will soon have been in office for a year , so we have to observe that you too will be accountable if you fail to meet your responsibilities .
We ought not to approve Parliament ' s accounts for as long as we have assistants who do not pay tax and yet obtain social security and for as long as travel expenses not connected to actual costs are refunded .
Mr President , the new Commission is not responsible for matters from the past , but it is to be judged on the basis of its willingness to straighten out its affairs .
The Commission has put the lid on the issue , and it has been impossible to obtain the necessary information .
That is not the case .
The Commission has , on the whole , employed many dodges to avoid responding to our questions , and that is completely unacceptable .
The Treaty is clear : in accordance with Article 276 , Parliament is entitled to obtain all necessary information in connection with the discharge procedure .
I should like to give an example .
It was sent to the Commission in November .
In the meantime , Mrs Fontaine received a letter from Mr Prodi , stating that the Commission was tired of answering all the stupid questions from the Committee on Budgetary Control .
The Commission is obliged to answer our questions , irrespective of whether or not it likes the content of these .
I hope the Commission will take our demands seriously .
I should like to explain what the ECHO case is about .
What signal is being sent out to present and future leaders of the Commission when the people responsible escape indictment ?
The ECHO scandal has still not led to any repercussions .
The case is at present before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg which admits that nothing will probably come of the case and that it will no doubt refer it to the Belgian authorities in a couple of years ' time .
It is about gross negligence and about an official who has taken decisions without regard to the finance regulation .
Now , the Commission has until 15 May to solve the problem .
I also think it is a good idea to look a little more closely at the discharge for the development fund .
The Commission ' s delegations have failed .
Unfortunately , there are too many delegations which are just there for the ride .
The final thing I want to say is that the Commission should undertake to refer the fraud cases to OLAF .
I obtained 11 reports under Pentagon-like conditions , but OLAF still does not know anything about these .
I therefore think it is time that these matters were tidied up , and I am pleased that Mr Nielson has now shown that he wants to get this process under way .
The Internet has created an entirely new situation where the duplication , sale and distribution of child pornography is concerned .
It is not , therefore , possible for an individual State effectively to contain the spread of child pornography .
However , we were very pleased about the far-sighted messages which were to be found in the conclusions from the Summit .
I also want to express satisfaction at the fact that the open coordination with which we are familiar from employment policy is to be used as a tool in other areas to promote the use of information technology and reinforce training and strengthen research .
Working for common goals in this open and flexible way , in which countries can measure themselves against each other and learn from one another , is a good way both of ensuring progress and , at the same time , of guaranteeing individual countries ' freedom to seek their own solutions to their own problems .
I would also express great satisfaction at the fact that the opinion sets a time-frame for developing the single market in important areas , chiefly through the commitment to rapidly create a legal framework for e-commerce .
In developing employment policy and combating social exclusion , it is only right to invest not only in economic growth but also in education and training as a way of giving those who are excluded from society a foothold in the labour market and enabling them to help themselves .
Finally , I would offer an important and perhaps less complimentary remark .
I hope that we are not to read too much into this apparent emphasis upon the intergovernmental character of EU cooperation .
It was with great interest that I followed the European Council ' s summit in Lisbon .
It is , of course , all well and good to have the strategic goal of becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world with a view to creating sustainable growth .
The second problem is that the social problems entailed and which ( for better and , particularly , for worse ) are a very significant part of actual life in the European Union have been ignored .
The Presidency ' s conclusions talk of " the European social model " .
I am not aware of any European social model .
In my own country , there is a tradition which differs markedly from the dominant tradition in the European Union .
This was hinted at in the negotiations prior to the intergovernmental conference , namely the problem of implementing reforms so as to create a European social model
