Mention has been made of another amendment by Mr Goebbels , which he is going to withdraw , but I think it is extraordinarily intelligent and is the second message that Parliament is sending to the Commission .
The debate on how to create a better-working international monetary and financial system lies at the heart of our task of responding to globalisation .
A 'contagious ' effect can occur between one country and others and it is possible that capital flows will fluctuate .
The problems and challenges inherent in the integration of financial markets must be addressed in a broader context , which is what Mr Goebbels has sought to achieve in his report and what we in the Commission are seeking to achieve in the study that the Liège Ecofin meeting asked us to produce on how we can respond to the challenges of globalisation , which we are intending to present next February .
Much still remains to be done and , in its report , Parliament shows the correct way forward .
We are now in the early days of a process which will be long and we must continue working in this direction over the coming months .
How can we improve the situation ?
These two steps must be made in the same direction and at the same time .
It will provide Galician youth with the chance to become integrated into the labour market , make it easier for them to gain the necessary training and experience , both in their quest for a first job as well as subsequently being able to keep that job or to move on to other jobs .
So , what exactly is the problem ?
I think that this gives us an excellent opportunity to send a clear signal to the public that , at European level , we have a concept of the company that encompasses all those that work within it , which , it must also be said , is not only a democratic right of workers , but , also , these principles of information and consultation set the right path for companies to become more efficient , more effective , non-authoritarian and participatory .
Representatives of the Council , we are at second reading .
It is worth remembering , Commissioner , that these measures should not be limited to including only physical causes , such as vibrations , but should also take account of electromagnetic fields , noise and waves and optical radiation , for example , and also bear in mind the transitional period needed to make the required adjustments arising from the adoption of these measures .
The Commissioner referred to the finely balanced measures we have had to take in the last few years : Commissioner , we cannot continue in such an unmethodical fashion , we cannot continue to finance new priorities with the same resources .
I understand that this is not an exercise in revising financial perspectives , but we cannot continually take on new priorities to the detriment of the commitments that the European Union has already made .
Despite the current circumstances following the tragic events of 11 September , tourism will soon be the largest service industry in the European Union .
Social exclusion is another concern of the Committee on Women' s Rights , given that we are unfortunately witnessing the phenomenon of the 'feminisation of poverty ' .
Mr President , on behalf of my group and on my own behalf , I would like to thank the general rapporteur , Mr Costa Neves , and the other two rapporteurs , Mrs Buitenweg and Mr Seppänen .
Let us hope that between the first and second readings , the Commission will clarify the situation of this programme and the possible funding proposals .
It has never been explained why the Commission included these appropriations in the reserve , but the true consequence is that the rapporteur has had to employ ( and the political groups support him ) a strategy of cuts in order to achieve the mobilisation of these fishing appropriations which were never used .
If I had not lived through 17 European budgets , I would be amazed .
We have Afghanistan : we have to help Afghanistan .
The other question I wanted to raise , which is related to the last point , is whether there are first - and second-class European Councils .
The Council will then come in at the negotiation at second reading .
I trust that you will take advantage of the flexibility demonstrated by our rapporteur , Carlos Costa , whose work - as well as the efforts of the other two rapporteurs , Mrs Buitenweg and Mr Seppänen - deserves to be congratulated .
We must bear in mind that in the last three financial years very high payments were not used .
The Commission had proposed the 65 % guarantee normally considered for this type of operation laid down in the general mandate of the European Investment Bank .
In his report , Mr Seppänen made references to other fundings : the Turkish case is the most obvious , coming from the 2000 contributions .
This could be one of the instruments , like any other which may be necessary , for creating a greater margin for manoeuvre in future actions .
Furthermore , certain important steps have already been taken , such as the most urgent stabilisation work , which , undoubtedly , were a great concern .
Thank you very much .
It is also important to stress that the directive deals with a work problem which unfortunately affects women more than men : sexual harassment , which will not only be prosecuted and punished , but prevention measures will also be adopted in companies .
The eventful journey of this report through the competent committees , leading to its approval , is a testimony to
