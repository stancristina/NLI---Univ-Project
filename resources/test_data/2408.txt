promote social access , and I wish to stress in particular the care we must devote to people with special needs .
Mr President , Commissioner , let me begin by saying that I regard this present debate on the excellent report by Mr Hughes as a very important symbolic debate .
I think this must be followed up , and I stress that the emphasis placed on dialogue with the civil society in various forums is extremely important , though more important still is social dialogue with the social partners , which is of course not just a fashion which has had its day .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it seems that the issue of trade and economic relations between the European Union and the USA is one which usually inspires very heated debates and , I would say , intense passions .
That happens because so far we have been unable to form relations of mutual trust and open , sincere communication , despite the prolonged talks and negotiations , despite the planning of an ambitious programme and despite the honest efforts both by the Commission and by our rapporteur , our esteemed colleague Mrs Erika Mann , whom I congratulate on her report .
So in view of the forthcoming transatlantic summit conference , the European Parliament must today send out some very clear messages , such as these : First , the bipartite approach is acceptable to the extent that it does not impede multipartite negotiations at WTO level and does not create obstacles to access by third countries to markets in the Union and the USA .
Fourth , cooperation must include and emphasise social issues , such as securing the rights of working people and safeguarding collective bargaining , the abolition of child labour and forced labour , job creation , and the mutual recognition of qualifications .
Finally , the European Parliament must be kept constantly informed about the negotiations , most particularly about matters that relate to co-decision procedures .
Commissioner , whilst you know that all of us MEPs stand up for our regions and for the correct implementation of the Second Community Support Framework , trying to get more money for the forthcoming Santer package , there is unfair treatment here and we denounce that .
To a written question I submitted to you a while ago about the Patras-Athens-Thessaloniki project , you answered that the work had not been put right even though you had asked for that to be done , and that the delay was worrying .
Do you know anything about that ?
Commissioner , thank you very much for your answer .
Finally , time marches on inexorably , Commissioner , towards the end of the Second Community Support Framework .
So the conclusion I draw is that the procedures followed had certain deficiencies .
What do you think of the syllogism I have stated , because you cannot both grant approval and say that in future the Greek Government must avoid such practices .
It concerns the accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union .
In that sense , I think it is very important to stand by what Mr van den Broek once said here , and our principle should be that the accession of the Republic of Cyprus must not be held hostage by any other country .
I believe that the precise effect of today 's debate on the Commission 's proposals is : to prove that a decision of such historic scope can be achieved by a specific strategy , as complex and detailed as necessary but at the same time one which is cohesive , harmonious , and has clear mechanisms , procedures and legal bases ; -to demonstrate that the European Parliament has powers and responsibilities in this great matter and aspires to exercise them .So : pre-accession aid for the applicant countries , enhanced where necessary , and in parallel internal reforms in the European Union .
The Union 's political and economic interests make it necessary to outline a strategy which will create a climate of security and hope for all parts of the European continent , which will abolish the divisive lines of the past , and which will guarantee a decent life for all social groups and will in practice confirm the principles of European humanism and the values of peace , equality , democracy and solidarity .
But how can it be functional when at present , between Maastricht and the present day , the European Unions 's most vital policy , the Common Foreign and Security Policy , has not only failed to be promoted but is being dangerously afflicted ?
Mr President , Madam President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , I think the new Wye Plantation agreement is important , as also are the results of yesterday 's vote in the Knesset on the implementation of that agreement .
In parallel with the huge economic and technical aid it provides , the European Union should also maintain a permanent political presence in the area which , - and I am sorry to have to disagree with you , Madam President-in-Office - does not now exist .
And secondly , establish the presence of the European Union in all procedures involved in the implementation of and compliance with the content of the Wye Plantation agreement .
I did not criticise the Austrian Presidency for the fact that the Wye Plantation agreement was not concluded in Vienna or Salzburg , I simply said that I would have felt much better if it had been reached in Vienna or Salzburg , and I repeat as much .
Madam President , we agree that the CAP needs to be reformed , partly because of the new economic circumstances but also because of the malfunctions that have been noted in it so far
