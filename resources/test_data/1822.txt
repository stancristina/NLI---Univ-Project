exchange , conflict management , combating terrorism , environmental protection and policies to promote gender equality .
We went to Geneva the previous week to hold a meeting of the Steering Committee of the WTO Parliamentary Assembly that we have created with the Interparliamentary Union .
The fact is that that is the situation we are in , and the Director-General , Mr Lamy , has been given a mandate to try to determine the methods for applying the agreements reached in Hong Kong .
It now falls to the Commissioner to explain to us why it was not possible to make progress , above all , on the basis of agriculture and the NAMA , with other products , and also to what extent we can make progress on services .
Firstly , the Commission reacted to Parliament’s demand for enhanced involvement in the policy level , which is closer to the implementation phase .
This is a purely technical issue linked to the fact that , in a first reading agreement , the normal process of legal revision and verification can only take place after the vote .
In short , the proposed origin marking system will inform European consumers of the precise country of origin of the products they buy .
Our products must increasingly be associated with a high level of quality and style .
This is also a question of justice .
For all of these reasons , the intention of this Resolution is to roundly condemn the restrictions to freedom of expression that certain governments impose via the Internet , and in particular the acts of persecution and detention that some of them carry out .
In a short space of time , action was taken effectively in an excellent spirit of cooperation amongst the administrations .
His lucidity and intelligence , his professional standards and rigour , his complete consistency , and even the impertinence of the most lucid : he offered us one of the best examples of a vocation for European public service , based on a federalist , Europeanist and genuinely progressive conviction .
At the same time , as you have quite rightly pointed out , Commissioner , we have maintained a fluid and fruitful relationship with the Commission and the Council , which has resulted in compromise amendments that will make it possible to approve this report at first reading .
It should be remembered that the purpose for which the Agency has been created is to provide an appropriate framework for carrying out concrete actions aimed at increasing maritime safety and preventing pollution from ships in Member States’ waters , and also to provide the States with additional resources when national response resources are insufficient to deal with a large-scale incident .
This time , the Agency wants to conclude four new contracts for ships that will prioritise the two major Atlantic regions and the Mediterranean region .
In order to prevent such dangers , it has been agreed that , independently of the four-yearly assessment laid down in Article 7 , the European Parliament should be regularly informed about the financial execution of the Agency’s resources .
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe supports the proposal with the compromise amendments shared with other parliamentary groups , and we congratulate Mr de Grandes on his good report and the work he has done in order to reach a consensus so that this regulation can be approved at first reading .
In fact , even though the Commission expressly acknowledged that the area most affected by large-scale oil slicks over the last thirty-five years had been the Galician coast , with more than seven slicks greater than 10 000 tonnes , of the seven anti-pollution ships contracted by the Agency , not a single one was located in Galicia : five in the Baltic , one in the Mediterranean and another in the English Channel-North Atlantic region .
As Mrs Miguélez Ramos has quite rightly said , that has now been overcome and we are facing a much more practical and better-organised future .
For example , within the framework of the Berend report , this House approved a raft of amendments aimed at updating the European Union’s Solidarity Fund .
I would like to ask you when you formally received the request for assistance from the Spanish Government , and on precisely what date you were formally asked to activate the civil protection mechanism .
Their causes have been very well studied : more than 80 % are caused by human actions , either negligent or wilful , with a deliberate intention to cause damage .
On the one hand , that the Commission facilitate the application in this case of the Solidarity Fund by means of the political criterion : we want the Solidarity Fund to be applied to the affected populations and regions in the European Union .
When we are facing fires or floods though , we in the European Union carry on acting as if each one were an isolated event that did not deserve or require a genuine global approach and , in some people’s view , as if they did not have a genuine European dimension .
A fire or a flood , and in this case I am referring specifically to the situation in Galicia , completely destroys the already scant resources that a region needs for its development .
We truly have to take seriously the consequences of warming in this case and the rise in temperatures .
We must also analyse the extent to which all of us and the common agricultural policy are responsible for the forced abandonment of traditional agricultural activities by those people who , unable to find any alternative work , have left the rural areas and upset the land-planning balance , and therefore no longer look after the forests , or raise early alarms , or prevent arson attacks .
