contrary , my fellow Members put public cultural and political interests and the general public good at the heart of their deliberations , and I believe this is reflected most clearly in the following elements of the Trautmann report : Radio frequencies are defined as a public good and will also remain the responsibility of the Member States .
Let me conclude with a few words on the Alvaro report .
Hacking threatens private and public networks .
I am keen to find out how far advanced the deliberations are in the corridors of the Commission .
To that end we need intelligent solutions , and we need network security , for security is paramount .
For all that , we can surely agree , in fact , on the following basic principles : we need to be more awake to discrimination in the media , and we also need national monitoring authorities with which complaints can be lodged .
The compromise presented by the rapporteur is balanced and takes particular account of issues such as workability and the clarity of the provisions .
When discussing the GHS , we therefore placed particular importance on implementing it in a way that would be practical for consumers .
The first 0.5 megapixel digital camera was developed many years ago for space travel and cost around EUR 10 million , but nowadays , almost everyone has a digital camera .
That is a very important point that I want to get across today .
The question of filling station infrastructure will be handled by a public-private partnership .
The most frequent causes of death are haemorrhaging , infections and illegal abortions .
President Arias said today : we need an asymmetrical approach .
The parent companies should also be subject to tighter regulations on transparency and competition in future in order that the systems are prevented from making preferential offers to the disadvantage of other airlines and to the disadvantage of consumers .
We have to stand by the fact that we are protecting consumers and also have to accept the obvious consequences of this .
For this reason the report is demanding a minimum investment of 40 % of EU transport funds in the railways .
Upgrading the transport infrastructures applies in particular to rail transport .
It does seem to be the case that in the Commission 60 % of the money flowing into transport flows into roads as co-financing and only 20 % of it into environmentally friendly railways .
We are taking stock of what has been done up to now , and the question we must ask ourselves is this : have there been any visible results ?
This area of work must not be allowed to come to a standstill , and we believe that we can take this issue forward . on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , the Council representative said that there is considerable controversy in the Council on this issue , and that exists in the European Parliament as well .
On the contrary : in the shadow of the nuclear crisis , the murdering by the Mullah regime continues unabated .
They are protesting against the inhumane conditions , against torture and abuse , and against the death penalty .
It has rightly been stated that these sectors are also regulated by national regulations , some stronger , some weaker , according to the nations ' different traditions and according to which financial market regulations prevail there .
The present crisis is the hideous aftermath of a credit mania , specifically of the excessive expansion of debt .
In the euro area we are also in urgent need of European banking supervision for the euro area because we cannot carry on living with national supervision alone .
It makes perfect sense to incorporate them all into a European financial market and regulate them uniformly .
In short , the labour pains were difficult , and they are not yet over .
I believe the theory is good , but it is not being applied particularly well .
This is something that goes way beyond what the European Union has been doing until now .
In this respect I am also glad that we have been focusing on people and fundamental rights across party lines in this report .
Incidentally , criticism of the proposal is shared by all groups across their dividing lines , and I think that this unequivocal message should give the Council food for thought .
Creative and innovative projects , with the involvement of the surrounding regions , will provide a cultural experience of a particular kind .
It should not be forgotten , though , that terrorists do not appear from nowhere , but come into a country and grow up in an environment hostile to that country .
President-in-Office , we wish to acknowledge that you and your colleagues have already made great progress in the individual discussions on the six dossiers .
You may perhaps have to break through the esprit de corps in the Council - if an individual is reluctant , the others will not push him - because this concerns the safety of the natural environment and people and we shall have to reach a majority decision if need be .
It is essential for maritime safety that we retain the maritime package as a whole .
In this respect , President-in-Office , it is good to set up a crisis unit , but we are expecting to see a well-defined operations base and well-defined operations during the next stage .
What we are concerned with is conducting parliamentary discussion and carrying out scrutiny on behalf of the citizens of Europe and thereby conferring greater legitimacy and public recognition on agreements .
I would like to mention two in particular : firstly , we need appropriate institutional bases , and that certainly means the Treaty of Lisbon .
