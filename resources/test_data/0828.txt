We have added to an amendment which speaks of 25 % - which would be two and a half times the amount of national coal Spain currently uses - the fact that Member States might be able to apply these measures as a function of their requirements , in accordance with transitional arrangements .
There is , in the proposal , no mention of the objective of full employment nor any reference to the means necessary for the application of common jobcreation policies .
We are also critical of the confirmation of the model and the time periods relating to the single currency and we would ask the European Council to embark upon a public and wide-ranging debate in which all the various positions are included and a dialogue to discuss this single-currency model and its consequences , particularly with regard to employment .

I believe that the juveniles detained in Honduras under inhuman conditions are yet another expression of the poverty and marginalization that applies all over the world .
We also spoke of our concern about the fact that many young people in Europe live in the shadow of poverty .
We know that Algeria 's problems have to be solved by the Algerians themselves , but in maintaining relations between the European Union and Algeria and in the new framework for those relations , Europe must not forget that its own essence is based on democracy and respect for human rights , and it cannot turn a blind eye to a situation which flouts the most elementary standards of universal democracy .

Secondly , the banana regulation establishes protection for certain African , Caribbean and Pacific countries with which we have economic relations and which depend to a large extent on our protection .
