Do we want a European Union which only concerns itself with monetary policy , with competitiveness , with the internal market – matters which it quite rightly concerns itself with – or do we want a European Union which , at the same time , will be present at the major problems of daily life , present where there is human pain .
An intervention by the Solidarity Fund would also be positive , but I think that the European Union needs to have more tools at its disposal .
It needs a more substantial and more effective European civil protection mechanism , as called for by the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats in its motion .
We need to move at long last from theory to practice and I trust that the fact that the Council welcomed this report is not purely and simply an expression of diplomatic affability , but expresses the will of the European Union to be more present when such issues arise .     – Mr President , this year 's fires in the Mediterranean were the usual sad summer phenomenon .
Two areas of Greece , Halkidiki and Mani , suffered incalculable ecological and economic damage .
What point is there in our endeavouring to create European civil protection mechanisms when some governments ignore them so flagrantly ?
I had the honour of drafting the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , in which we proposed – and I would emphasise this – that prevention should be included in funding .
The fires caused a chain reaction , with huge consequences both for the ecosystem and the economy and for tourism , agriculture , livestock farming and beekeeping .
However , that is not enough .
That is because we are changing – or rather we have changed – and we are downgrading the climate of the planet , thereby exacerbating the greenhouse effect .
Preventive measures for the future and a new fire policy need to be applied .
If we are not generous to those who have been destroyed , then we should not be surprised if the people soon stop following us .
Secondly , from the undermining of progress in certain sectors of activity which are especially important to developing countries .
It tabled noteworthy proposals and abandoned many of its objectives right from the start of the round .
It also helps to disseminate enhanced economic interdependence across international political cooperation .
The stability of the global trade system calls , in my opinion , for new dynamic impetus to the link between commercial interdependence and joint responsibility between the European Union and the United States of America and this link between interdependence and joint responsibility must be verified .
With Mr Barón Crespo before me and his country 's victory over Greece in the World Basketball Championship in mind , I would suggest that we look on the outcome of these negotiations so far as time out rather than a definitive breakdown .     – Mr President , I wish to say straight from the outset that I agree absolutely with Commissioner Mandelson 's approach and the considerations he expressed .
However , this success cannot be achieved at any cost , nor can it be achieved with unilateral concessions on the part of the European Union .
That is why I consider the priority for an initiative to be taken on the part of the European Union for a major ambitious democratic reform of the World Trade Organisation to be of strategic importance , just as I consider the need for the European Union to submit an integrated strategic trade policy for the development of bilateral and regional trade relations to be of strategic importance .
The rapporteur , Mrs Gröner , the chairman of the committee , Mrs Záborská , and all the members determined with sensitivity and almost unanimously the target of protection from violence , namely the most vulnerable groups of our fellow Members .
Given that funding of Daphne ΙΙΙ is , in our opinion , satisfactory within the framework of the agreement on the financial perspective , we must expect the results of actions to be spectacular and to eradicate violence from civilised European society , not only by 50 % , as the rapporteur proposes , but if possible in its entirety , with systematic work and cooperation on the part of the authorities , local agencies , organisations and civil society .
The positive results are also expected through transparency in connection with the involvement of non-governmental organisations , which must take valued action and guarantee their positive contribution to healing the wounds of violence .
I should like to stress that the Commission was right not to merge the Daphne ΙΙΙ programme with the drugs programme , a position that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament and Mrs Gröner have firmly stood by .
Two and a half thousand years ago , in the Republic of Athens , in the time of Socrates , there was no crime , there was no violence against women .
Penalties must suddenly get stricter .
This is a crime .
We must therefore look effectively at prevention and at effective penalties for the guilty .     – Mr President , I wanted to explain that our objection to Amendment 68 on street children was not to this category per se , but to the categorisation of victims , which is something that the Commissioner emphasised .
The so-called reduction in initial prices will be cancelled out by a differentiated pricing policy on the part of the automobile industry and fluctuations in VAT.
