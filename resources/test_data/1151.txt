the European Parliament , the national parliaments , the governments and the Commission - a formula which will be increasingly refined by Laeken itself and the subsequent European Councils in 2002 .
It will also do so through the White Paper on governance .
We have got to where we are , and we should be proud of it .
More State and less market or more market and less State ?
President Prodi , we understand how difficult it is to summarise in a short document the complexity of the issues dealt with by the European Commission .
The second issue concerns the Mediterranean , whose importance was shown by a forum in which we took part last week .
Well , as regards the Mediterranean , substantial problems still remain unresolved .
We are awaiting European regulations on the use of the Internet .
Secondly , everyone - including Mr HÃ¤nsch and many other Members - said that the Commission/Parliament report should be a question of working together .
I am only bringing this up as a problem we must think about but , clearly , in the spring of 2004 the electoral campaign will begin , in June the elections will be held , and then there will be the installation of the new Commission , which will not assume power until January 2005 .
As regards Laeken , I would really like to avoid any misunderstanding : in my view , the time has come to establish the full structure of the debate on the future of Europe .
There are - and we must work on this - some points that are essential .
This we must do , and we must accordingly think about the procedures necessary for achieving it .
This does not have to be compulsory but it is undoubtedly a tool which helps them to move from country to country more easily .
What is coming through is a strong desire for a Europe which is seen , by its very nature - precisely because it is Europe - to have relinquished all traces of a colonial past and any legacy which could cause tension , and which is seen as a new proposal and , above all , a model of cooperation they can follow .
I would like , once again , to emphasise that this is an extraordinarily important but extremely difficult matter .
Earlier on , I quoted Kofi Annan , but , in fact , the process of enlargement itself is regarded by the United Nations and by everyone as a supreme message of peace and civilisation to the whole world .

Report ( A5-0031/2001 ) by Mr Bakopoulos , on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , on I. the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation concerning the Committee on Safe Seas and amending the regulations on maritime safety and the prevention of pollution from ships [COM(2000 ) 489 - C5-0475/2000 - 2000/0236(COD ) ] II . the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending the directives on maritime safety and the prevention of pollution from ships [COM(2000 ) 489 - C5-0476/2000 - 2000/0237(COD ) ] ( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution ) Report ( A5-0042/2001 ) by Mr Nicholson , on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries , on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing measures to be applicable in 2001 for the recovery of the stock of cod in the Irish Sea ( ICES Division VIIa ) [COM(2000 ) 745 - C5-0683/2000 - 2000/0292(CNS) ] ( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution ) EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Hansenne report ( A5-0029/2001 )
Of course , this can be accomplished by improving coordination and the play of balance between the Union 's different policies , but there is no doubt that the Community legislation on the subject needs to be more effective and more stringent .
Therefore , we can wait no longer - and here the Commission must assume its responsibilities - for a revision of the directive on European works councils , mass redundancies and relocation of enterprises , which does not make specific provision for a system of effective penalties for failure to comply .
The reason for this is that a controversial , delicate compromise had to be found between all the interests covered by the directive .
I see this as an improvement on the text of the common position .
For all these reasons , it should I hope , be possible , at last , to adopt the text of this directive tomorrow .
The undertaking , confirmed yesterday in a letter from the Commission to the Members of the parliamentary delegation , is important in political terms but does not entirely make up for the delays in preparing a clear , well-defined proposal .
Improvements have been made in the areas of labelling and traceability , and a public information mechanism has been provided for .
So , as far as GMOs are concerned , we must not forget that the situations in many different countries are different .
