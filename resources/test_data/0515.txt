perspective , namely that for 2007-2013 .
It would mean that , instead of competing on the same basis , we should get into a situation in which agricultural policy would be about competition between the various national exchequers and between the different finance ministers of the EU’s 25 Member States .     Mr President , I should like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Graefe zu Baringsdorf , for his work on the report on risk and crisis management in agriculture .
Also fresh in our memories is the huge amount of expenditure incurred by Europe as a result of infectious diseases in animals and efforts to eradicate and combat these .
The CAP reform was a large and important step in that direction .
I do not , however , think that the Commission has shown a sufficient sense of urgency about coming up with proposals for eliminating or reducing risks and for averting crises and outbreaks of disease that we could well do without .
Who is to cover the losses due to future outbreaks of disease ?
Why has the Commission not put proposals on the table concerning the provision of insurance cover by private and mutual insurance companies – something requested by the European Parliament as long as two years ago ?
This area must therefore be investigated very quickly with a view to devising cover for the large losses that the agricultural budget will not in future be able to cover .
The committee takes decisions that often have only one purpose , namely to grab more money for itself and its friends .
Today , it is crisis management and insurance schemes that are at issue .
However , it also contains some bad things , and it is those on which I want to concentrate on this occasion .
I have been told that the spokesman for the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance fought hard for this to happen , but that he was in a minority in the committee .
What is more , crisis management and insurance schemes should have to do with genuine crises .
I find it commendable that farmers everywhere in Europe should show solidarity with each other if their farms are hit by serious diseases such as BSE , foot and mouth disease or avian influenza .
It is a sign of the Committee on Agriculture’s patent unaccountability .
Finally , I expect support for the request by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance for a split vote with a view to removing the committee’s demand for aid for offsetting high oil prices .
It is depressing to see how often Members of the European Parliament , who otherwise work to bring about a green Europe and to forestall disaster where the climate is concerned , go no way towards discovering what goes on in the Committee on Agriculture .
This is something that the groups ’ spokesmen on environmental and climate issues should have nipped in the bud .
I do not , unfortunately , believe that anything will happen until the European Parliament obtains real influence over agricultural policy and until we get rather more people with farther-reaching visions of Europe in the committee .     Madam President , personally , I do not care for the expression ‘forced prostitution ’ because all prostitution is more or less forced , but our group naturally supports the resolution put forward .
It is discriminatory and shameful and a disgusting crime .
It is crucial that we do more to help this extremely weak and vulnerable group of trafficked children and women .
On my own behalf , I should also like to welcome the fact that a thorough debate on prostitution in general is taking place .
The majority of prostitutes live miserable lives , exposed to the risks of , for example , assault , rape and sexually transmitted diseases .
Who , moreover , among those present in this Chamber would be pleased if his or her daughter were to become a prostitute ?
It now appears that this was not a pause for thought but , rather , entailed a change in the order of who is to ratify and when .
The process is under way in Estonia , and Finland will approve the Constitution before it takes over the Presidency on 1 July .
Just one small party , representing true Finns , will respect the French and Dutch ‘no’ votes .
The provisions of the Constitution cannot , however , be the basis for changing the Treaty of Nice , where unanimity is the rule .
The Constitution is therefore formally dead following the French and Dutch ‘no’ votes .
In the Netherlands the government has stated that it will not ratify the rejected document , and in France the leading politicians say the same thing .
I should like to ask the Presidency whether France and the Netherlands have formally agreed that the ratifications can continue without changes to the rejected document .
This is most certainly one of the areas for which real grass-roots support may be secured .
All investigations show , however , that it is very difficult to find grass-roots opposition to cross-border cooperation on precisely the areas we are debating today .
We support the attempt to split the two programmes up , and we are in favour of securing as substantial funding for the programmes as it is reasonably possible to obtain .
The idea is to make sure that as few resources as possible are expended on bureaucracy and that most go into increased efforts in those areas about which we are in agreement .
I hope that we really will succeed in sending a clear signal to Europeans that the EU can make a difference of benefit to us all in this area .     Mr President , I too wish to welcome the ceasefire and the fact that weapons are being laid down and replaced with voting papers
