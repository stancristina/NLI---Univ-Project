to the possible problems I may have inside and outside Spain .
In this way , this Parliament abandoned codecision for a mere opinion , without being able to control whether these programmes were going to be complied with or not , since they were being left to the Member States and were being transferred to a regulation whose control by Parliament was reduced to an opinion .
It was very difficult for the countries of the European Union , especially those which have been ablaze this summer – in all corners of Europe , but essentially the countries of the south – to understand why prevention should not be included in this regulation .
All of this means that the citizens of Europe aspire to having the same quality of bathing water , regardless of the country or location they are swimming in .
Introducing these parameters would enormously complicate the application of the directive and , furthermore , would make the framework directive which already deals with these issues redundant .
Issues of this kind are usually consigned to evening sittings .
Nonetheless , we are proceeding to conciliation .
We are only opposed to five of the 32 amendments tabled .
I should state that the Commission is able to support the two amendments tabled by Mr Sterckx at the eleventh hour .
The Council had already drastically shortened the deadlines .
We therefore support his amendments to Article 8 .
The House made this abundantly clear at first reading .
The last internal discussions are under way .
We trust this Parliament will begin work on it , and that it or its successor will bring the work to a satisfactory conclusion .
As soon as a European railway law comes into force , existing European operators will begin to compete amongst themselves .
Ladies and gentlemen , I certainly agree with you that the safety criterion is crucial .
Mrs Ainardi , Mr Jarzembowski , Mr Sterckx and Mr Savary have all done splendid work .
This represents a considerable challenge .
On the contrary , essential urgent legislation is called for .
They all need to be involved in the solution .
That is what we are about .
By contrast , orderly , appropriate and socially responsible liberalisation involves going out to companies and local authorities in search of freight .
The railways need finance .
Everyone seems to agree , however , that this is the last opportunity to give a real boost to the rail sector .
This will result in better services , prices and quality and increased competitiveness .
Turning to the human factor , this is crucial .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the House already helped to ensure the survival of the railways by supporting the first rail package .
We believe it is in line with the key tenets of our strategic position .
Firstly , there is the reference to the financial perspective after 2006 .
We are therefore retaining our amendment regarding the basic remuneration of the Council’s staff .
Decisions on allocations for the Union 's external action cannot be taken solely on the basis of accounting criteria or criteria for budget implementation .
Lastly , I am sure the amendment will deal with the following issue , and that other speakers will speak on it at greater length and more eloquently .
We note that everything from the protection of hazelnut cultivation to a pilot project for helping victims of terrorism has been included .
The European Commission is asking for , and can only justify , EUR 160 million for 2004 for the Community contribution to the reconstruction of Iraq .
From Africa ?
In this regard , on 9 October the Commission presented to the Council of Ministers its new proposal containing a statement of projects of European interest .
We therefore proposed that resources be allocated at European level to assist the promotion , monitoring and assessment of an ecologically and socially sustainable tourism policy , which , however , was rejected .
Regardless of the final result , therefore , in the basic instruments relating to the issue of pre-allocations , at first reading the Committee on Budgets has maintained the pre-allocation in the corresponding lines for the 2004 budget , as was done in previous years .
Further to that , I would like to point out that the plan to reduce other policies does not originate from this Parliament , which has increased external action , but was the niche prepared by the Commission precisely in order to fund this priority of Iraq .
We need to improve border control , combat illegal immigration effectively , which leaves victims on our coasts almost every day , and we need countries of origin and transit to manage migratory flows effectively while respecting human rights .
On 6 March , Germany notified the Commission of its intention to introduce a system of reimbursement of tolls – reimbursement , partial at least , or payment – based on special charges , which could allow payment of up to a sum of 15 cents on average .
I would like to say that there has not yet been any discrimination , amongst other things because the toll is not operational .
Furthermore , we can maintain that legal basis , which is the one for transport , because we are talking about a payment for the use of an infrastructure , provided that the money received in this way does not enter the State’s accounts , because if it enters the public accounts , the administrative budgets , whether of the State , of the Autonomous Community or of a region , we would automatically be returning to the fiscal legal basis and it would therefore require unanimity .
What we are ultimately talking about is genuinely protecting , , the human rights of women at international level , and we have the instruments .
