be more cotton in Greece ! "
I feel that advice from such an interested user , a connoisseur consumer of these nuts , cannot be ignored , and so I voted for the development of hazelnut production in Europe .
However , there seems to be little public knowledge of the Bank 's existence and operations , although it is a public institution that lends more money every year than , for example , the better-known World Bank .
Mr President , Page 6 , point 6 of this report on the impact of liberalisation and the economic reform process on the economic growth of the European Union reads : "( The rapporteur ) considers that the ageing of the population will necessitate new ways of increasing participation in the labour market , especially among women and older workers " .
Mr President , yesterday evening - the evening of Valentine 's Day - some friends and I were looking for a restaurant , but we could not find a free table anywhere .
I have asked for clarification and am told that a letter has just arrived , to which I have not yet replied .
This very afternoon sees the beginning - the first meeting with the trade unions and the staff will take place today at 4 o'clock - of a further stage of consultation and conciliation , which is just as important and just as exacting , involving all the staff and all the representatives .
Therefore , we intend to make every endeavour to secure a broad , intense debate on the guidelines and details of the reform , so that it becomes the common legacy of all and all commit themselves to furthering its progress .
I have to say , in this regard , that training has always been overlooked .
To return to the question of demoralisation among staff : clearly , we have created a sense of insecurity this year .
We plan to have the definitive reference framework ready within the next few months , before the summer , the following stage then being to implement the individual chapters .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I do not want to go back over ground that has already been covered , and so I will refrain from describing the content of the amending budget proposed by the Commission and already adopted by the Council .
The Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party has tabled a series of amendments on this point , seeking , as you are aware , to revise the intervention percentages to achieve a 50/50 split between the Union and the Member States .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in a short space of time , the European telecommunications industry has , thanks to the impetus given to it by the Community institutions and the innovative action of the market , moved over from a system based on national monopolies to one based on general liberalisation .
There is a particular risk of the rules and instruments set out in the directive being applied indiscriminately to extremely different situations , such as access for operators and users to end-user services , network facilities , system facilities , networks and roaming .
The proposal for a directive applies the 'new ' significant market power ' or 'reduced domination ' concept , which , its 'negative ' feature of hampering competition having been corrected , leaves the field open to ex ante measures .
An issue which is particularly close to my heart , as a local administrator apart from anything else , is reducing the number of masts in residential areas .
We would , however , like to emphasise the existence , in any case , of a serious contradictory situation affecting the electronic telecommunications sector which , if , something is not done , is likely , in time , to sabotage any endeavours to create a situation of competition benefiting the consumer .
The contradiction lies in the genuine conflict of interests present in many European States , who find themselves in a situation in which they are both regulators and holders of economic and political interests , both referees and players in the game .
We will only be able to achieve this when we have succeeded in prising out the root of this fundamental problem of multiple roles and the conflict of interests , which are still there at State level , with the weight of the State in the electronic communications economy : only then will we be able to bring this sector into line with the common competition law which prevails in the other sectors .
It was decided by the forum bureau to give the women from the European Parliament the subject of 'Globalisation , migration and citizenship' : this is the title of our contribution and also of the contribution of the speakers from Tunisia , for the reports expound two different viewpoints .
In my opinion , it is possible to meet this challenge and it will provide us with the opportunity to tackle , together with them , for example , the issue of respect for human rights - a recurring subject in our relationship with these countries about which there is always a hint of interference in their internal affairs - on fresh , equal ground , which will challenge those societies - but also our own - where , for example , the issue of migration poses cultural problems and problems of integration and convergence .
In any case , I feel that a text adopted in Parliament would provide the representatives of the European Parliament with a mandate which may well , so to speak , be less free but more representative : it would be up to the representatives of this House to strike a wise balance between these two criteria
