A common arms exports policy is essential to this process .
That is why the framework agreement signed by the six Member States in July was so important .
Despite the enormous progress made , there are areas where the code of conduct needs to be strengthened .
The Council annual report itself identified the need for a common list of military equipment to be established .
This was agreed in June and progress has been made on the list for paramilitary , public order , and internal security equipment .
I wholeheartedly welcome these developments .
The code , however , is only a political commitment between Member States .
It should be legally binding .
Article 7 of the code commits Member States to prevent exports being diverted to undesirable end users .
Yet end user regulations vary enormously from country to country .
They should be better coordinated and more effective .
As a starting point we need a Community-wide database of information on licences and sensitive end users .
It is clear that many weapons find themselves in the wrong hands because of the activity of arms brokers .
Yet most countries have little , if any , control over them .
In my own country I would need a licence to own a shotgun but not to set up as an arms broker in my garden shed .
This is wrong and I welcome the British Government 's announcement last week that it is to stop .
We need to control the activities of arms brokers throughout the EU.
I was stunned recently to discover that there are up to 300 arms brokers in the south-east of England alone .
Modern civilisation is rightly offended by this unregulated trade in death .
That is why progress has to be made on the German presidency proposals to control arms broking .
That should be a priority now .
Lastly , the greatest safeguard against abuse of arms exports is transparency .
The annual report is a large step forward but its transparency depends on the transparency of the national reports which it is created from .
Some are better than others .
Since 1997 my own government has published annual reports on arms exports which have been praised for their transparency .
I urge all other governments to do the same .
I commend my report to the House .
I urge the Council to act on my recommendations in order to enhance the EU 's commitment to global peace and stability .
Thank you , Commissioner .
I can see that you are tackling the task of bringing in the framework between 2002 and 2006 in a very efficient and workmanlike way .
You say that you intend to concentrate on projects where there is considerable European added value and that you will therefore be applying criteria .
Could you tell us a little bit more about what those criteria might be ?
Could you also say how you envisage the role of the Joint Research Centre in undertaking an evaluation of technological foresight programmes which might indicate to us the sorts of areas where this European added value might be most useful ?
Mr President , I would also like to welcome Mr Busquin 's statement .
Many of the ideas that we discussed in the report from the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy have been taken on board .
There are two points that I would like Mr Busquin to explore a bit further with us this afternoon .
The first is that he specifically mentioned in his statement EU participation in national programmes .
Could he expand a little on what he envisages and say whether that will entail the EU partly funding national programmes and acting as a coordinator or will the JRC become one of the actors in a broader research network on an equal basis , for example , with other national research teams .
I would also like to press Mr Busquin on a point that Mr Pi√©trasanta made , because I do not think he answered that and it was a point that I certainly supported .
Can he confirm that he will be considering some pilot programmes in 2000-2001 in order to develop some of the networking concepts ahead of full implementation ?
Mr President , the reason that prices differ between the islands and the mainland has nothing to do with excise duty .
Excise duty is absolutely identical in all parts of the United Kingdom .
I should like to ask this : is the Commission aware of a recent highly reputable Swedish academic study which has demonstrated that taking all costs into account , transport costs in the UK are in fact average compared with the European Union as a whole ?
Taking account of non-wage labour costs , the cost of licensing and insuring vehicles and road tolls , the UK is no more expensive to drive in than any other part of the European Union .
Given the Community 's commitment to meeting its Kyoto commitments , I wonder whether the Commissioner would accept that the best way of doing so is by higher fuel duties , as opposed to raising the other transport costs .
If you want to conserve fuel , the way to do it is through fuel duty , not other forms of taxation .
Mr President , I accept the Commissioner 's very balanced arguments about Kyoto and the economic repercussions thereof but we are talking here about particular problems in peripheral and remote areas .
If the Commission has no instruments to influence levels of excise taxes in Member States , and if favouring certain industries is not allowed under the competition rules , surely where a region suffers special disadvantages because of peripherality and remoteness , it would only be a case of equalising matters , not of giving any special preference if
