be they public - or private-sector employers , pay for this two-year delay by the Greek authorities ?     .
The Commission does not therefore have jurisdiction to take measures to abolish this term , in that no such obligation to convert contracts derives from the directive .
In addition , as Mr Papadimoulis referred to civil rights , the Commission could in fact take action against the Member State in the event of damage caused by late and incorrect transposition of a directive .
At the same time , we express our deep concern about future developments in the area in relation to USA and EU plans and the manifest copying of their strategy by the Russian Government in the areas of internal and external security , especially their adoption of the doctrine of preventive war .
The 'political solution ' which they propose and the so-called internationalisation of the problem aim to turn the area into a Kosovo-type protectorate .
Iraq is sinking deeper and deeper into violence and instability and is now lacking even fundamental security .
Despite the legalisation of the occupying forces as a multinational force by the Security Council , the occupation continues ; it is a fact of life and the source and main reason for the continuing conflict .
However , I fear that they cannot be implemented .
They place particular emphasis on public borrowing , in order to persuade the pension systems to make immediate changes , they further commercialise care , they reduce social spending and they promote quicker capitalist restructurings , in order to reduce the cost of labour and increase the profits of big business .
The proposed revision confirms that the only way to combat the Stability Pact and the anti-grass roots policy of the European Union in general is insubordination and disobedience on the part of the workers and by stepping up the working-class struggle .     – Mr President , the changes being promoted by the European Commission in the Stability Pact do not affect its neo-liberal philosophy .
The Confederal Group of the United European Left – Nordic Green Left , at the opposite end of the spectrum to criticism by European bankers mouthing their absolute neo-liberal doctrine , is demanding radical reform of the Stability Pact .
I agree that we must take account not only of the actual but also of the structural deficit , by overlooking short-term cyclical fluctuations in GDP.
I also agree that we need to examine the extent to which a country has exorbitant expenditure for which it alone is not responsible , as with Greece and the extraordinary spending on the Olympic Games .
It is a success of which we are all particularly proud .
Secondly , at the very least we must help to inform citizens in clear , simple words about the differences which exist between the Treaty of Nice and this new Constitution .
It does not end with its approval .
Rights which they need to know in order to take advantage of them .
I too have taken a stand by saying that there is a further source of assistance over and above the familiar financial framework and over and above the 2004 budget : are you assessing whether these countries in South East Europe are honouring their commitments ?     – I should like to ask the President-in-Office if he would allow me to extend the search for the positive profile of Europe somewhat , beyond the Europe of the twenty-five to the rest of the world .
It resulted in the death of thousands of innocent people , tremendous damage and the imposition of occupation on Kosovo and was the climax of the break-up of Yugoslavia and the imperialist intervention in the Balkans .
The rulings by what is referred to as the ' International Criminal Tribunal ' are not accepted by the people , who alone have the authority to judge their leaders and sentence any defendants .
Why does it maintain absolute silence and not denounce the governments of Member States of the ΕU , the USA , Australia , Japan and so on who voted against it ?
The political powers which endorse the resolution accept and support the occupying forces of Iraq , fighting and are cooperating with the occupying government and call the resistance of the Iraqi people to the occupying forces and the collaborationist government terrorism .
The people , and the people of Europe , are demanding the immediate withdrawal of all the occupying forces , which must compensate the Iraqi people for their crimes and for the destruction which they have caused .
The powers which endorse the resolution have opposed the general demand by voting down the amendment calling for the withdrawal of foreign forces and again supporting the war .     . – We are voting against the resolution on the situation in Vojvodina , which we see as an attempt to create particularly dangerous conditions in order to pave the way for further gratuitous imperialist intervention in the long-suffering area of the Balkans .
We cannot tolerate and we denounce both the efforts to mislead public opinion , as some would wish , and the EU 's blatant intention to confirm the threatening and aggressive role of the European army once again in Vojvodina .     – The policies promoted by the outgoing Commission had an adverse impact on the working classes and grass roots sections of society .
The Commission contributed to and promoted a deeply reactionary Constitutional Treaty , which will create new ordeals for the workers .
The implementation of the Lisbon strategy confirmed the objective of increasing the profitability of big business by reducing wage costs and creating conditions of insecurity and uncertainty for workers .
The results , once again , have been tragic , with dozens of Palestinians , mainly civilians and children , killed or injured .
