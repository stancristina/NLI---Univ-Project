codecision .
I am particularly addressing the groups that are blocking this decision in Parliament , starting with the Group of the European People ' s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats .
In this respect I would also like to address my colleagues in the European People ' s Party - and I would ask Mr Poettering to listen to me - because what we advocate in this Assembly , we should also advocate outside it .
To this end , I believe that we should apply the same standards to all .
In other words , we might yet please him by providing this report he is so keen on .
It therefore seems that mentioning the Charter in the Treaty of Nice is something that makes perfect sense .
Right now , Mr Barak and Mr Arafat must make their people understand that it is only through dialogue at a negotiating table , with painful concessions on both sides , that the conflict can be definitively resolved .
Some would consider this to be the equivalent of throwing a lifebelt to enable certain states to survive the shipwreck of Community construction , and to others it involves creating a hard core of supposedly elite countries , or patanegra states , as we would say in Spanish , states that would , by virtue of their power , cohesion and weight , act as a veritable cabinet .
Dividing up legislative and executive powers or replacing them with a greater number of bodies , secretariats , parallel chambers and the like does not lead to democracy but to inefficiency .
I hope that the spirit of Biarritz that we have talked about so much today will materialise , as spirits that do not materialise become ghosts and the attic of European construction is full of such ghosts .
We must ask for maximum progress to be made in this field in a coherent manner - as indicated in Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado ' s excellent report - seeing reinforced cooperation as a last resort that would make it possible in all areas in which decisions are not taken by a qualified majority and also with regard to the CFSP and defence , for the permanence of the single institutional framework to be guaranteed , for a sufficient critical mass of countries to take part in it and , of course , for it to be open at all times .
That is , there is an error in the Italian version of the text resulting from an incorrect translation .
It is to be hoped , therefore , that on Thursday it should in principle be approved without any difficulty .
I think I can say that , essentially , the problem is the tremendous increase in legislative work in the European Union as a whole , in particular the exponential growth of legislative codecision , the huge range of legislative decisions taken in parallel .
The Commission is implicitly required to consider at the beginning of the legislative procedure whether it has the necessary human resources and whether the proposal might require a revision of the financial perspective or a redeployment of previously approved programmes .
I shall end , Mr President , by thanking the other institutions for their diligence in the handling of this joint declaration .
This is not enough to meet the challenges of the Common Fisheries Policy , to finance the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance , the fisheries agreements and our participation in international organisations , to monitor the implementation of the CFP , the common organisation of the market for fisheries products and aquiculture , research into the fishing environment and the compilation of data which is essential for the implementation of the CFP.
Whilst employment may be the European Union ' s priority policy , fisheries , as another economic sector , cannot remain on the sidelines .
All parties must assume their responsibilities and fulfil their obligations .
All in all , we would like to see these amendments approved .
Many of us believe that the problems in Colombia , as in other Latin American countries , stem from the issue of whether or not peasant-farmers own land .
However , what emerges most clearly now is the huge problem of the under-utilisation of all categories of spending : in rural development , in the Structural Funds , in the major external aid programmes .
We should recognise that she is being a very reasonable rapporteur and that she is seeking consensus .
Now , in 2000 , after more than 15 years of parliamentary history , is when this initiative comes to Parliament .
We are now at first reading and you have enough time to seek full agreement with Parliament .
There have always been a great deal of problems with payments .
But I would like to focus my comments on the ECSC operating budget , which needs to be examined in the light of the fact that we are on the threshold of the expiry of the Treaty .
The ECSC operative budget for 2001 does not move away substantially from the line taken in recent years .
On behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , I would like to thank her for the way that she took on board our amendments and points of view , both in the spirit and in the actual text of the report .
The Commission has sent a communication , which is a programme , a sort of timetable for what is going to be done .
This may even be the view of some of our fellow MEPs of the outermost regions .
Mrs Sudre has succeeded in putting together a balanced report that includes many of the amendments - more than 100 of them - which were tabled for the initial draft report
