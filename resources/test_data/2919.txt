Maritime security must be more than a response to the terrorist threat .
The amendment of the SOLAS Convention and of Part A of the ISPS Code involves mandatory provisions .
The European Maritime Safety Agency will be charged with providing support for the execution of these tasks .
Another concerned setting up a European coastguard service or body before 2010 .
It would then be possible for this regulation to be applied as from 1 July 2004 .
The rapporteur has made it possible for the opinion of the Committee on Citizens ’ Rights , Justice and Home Affairs to be largely incorporated into the work of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism .
They are all liable to become soft targets .
Illegal handling of such substances represents a particular hazard both for the environment and human beings .
I must also reiterate that I am in favour of the broadest interpretation of the concept of maritime security .
It is also important to monitor application of the security measures and train teams through practical experience and simulations involving staff responsible for the safety of ships , ports and both international and domestic maritime transport .
It is clear that we are facing problems and that adjustments will have to be made , but improving our safety , improving traffic safety , improving security in ports is a necessity and an obligation which we must fulfil .
The European Parliament must be on the front line in this fight and I hope that the recently created temporary committee will continue with this consensus and provide the best possible resources and instruments in this fight and lead it on behalf of the European Union at world level .     . – Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Miguélez Ramos , once again for the work she has done , as well as the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism on the way in which they have carried out their work and the improvements they have made to the text , since the majority of the amendments are acceptable , although in some cases with a slightly different wording .
Two of them we cannot accept because they call into question the delicate balance we have achieved with the Council with regard to the extension of these measures to national traffic .
I would like to say very clearly that the Commission supports this compromise ; although I know that certain honourable Members are opposed to it , I would like to ask you to reflect before rejecting this compromise .
We have had three years of negotiations and I simply believe that rejecting this initiative would cause very serious problems for transport policy in the coming years .
It is obvious that this self-handling by on-board personnel is going to function with short distance transport .
What we are talking about is , for example – and once again we are talking about cabotage and short sea shipping – the captain who uses a route on a daily basis , or two or three times a week , who knows the route perfectly , being able possibly to obtain authorisation not to require pilotage .
I would like once again to thank Mr Imbeni and of course Mr Jarzembowski for their work throughout this time .     Mr President , the truth is that , as has been quite rightly pointed out , we have dedicated two and a half years of work on an important and critical issue which , as we can see , inspires great passion .
The Europe of the nineteenth century , the Europe which reflects the Chicago of the Twenties , is not my Europe .
One of the questions arising from this organisation of maritime transport is – this question has been asked here – whether or not it is sustainable to try to regulate and liberalise ports .
In this regard , it is notable that the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats has already approved a law in the Spanish Parliament which allows for self-handling for this type of service on the part of any shipping or brokering company and takes it for granted that this crazy liberalisation will be approved by this European Parliament .
At the time it was said that this would pose enormous risks in terms of aircraft safety .
We are not talking about liberalising and implementing the various controls of maritime traffic in ports , nobody is proposing that .
They are not going to have to change it .
If there is really a security risk , do you believe that any national authority is not going to recognise the obligatory nature of pilotage ?
I could accept you saying to me : ‘there is a political problem , we need the support of the unions , they are against it and we cannot vote for it’ .
How are we really going to develop more cabotage in the European Union if we do not improve the performance and efficiency of our current port services ?
Whatever the result is , we will continue working once again and I will continue to count on your support , as I do generally in relation to all the initiatives I present .     Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to begin by saying that this is a good proposal from the Commission which furthermore is coherent in general terms .
It is particularly important to establish clear rules for the transport of waste by ship and , in this regard , Mr Blokland has presented Amendment 92 , which we support , because it resolves the problem of ships which are exported in order to be scrapped .
Mr President , Commissioner ,
