Moreover , there is , in our opinion , a danger that the market would lose its dynamism if concentration processes were to be interfered with on a far bigger scale than at present .
We accordingly consider the Commission ’s proposal for increasing its investigative resources under this Regulation excessive , particularly if viewed in the context of the enormous fines that the Commission can impose for non-compliance with the provisions of the Regulation .
This could also speed up the procedure and improve the quality of the administration of justice .     Mr President , it will not have escaped the attention of those involved in this issue that those members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs who are also members of the Group of the Party of European Socialists have voted against the final report .
Consideration should in this respect also be given to the required cohesion of policy .
Then there is the question of whether their arguments will be addressed seriously if they are consulted about the employment and social implications of the proposed merger .
Never do we in any way take note of these statistics .
The nineteenth century saw the start of railway tunnels , to which were added , in the twentieth , tunnels for cars .
Roads offer individual drivers too much freedom for dangerous and deviant behaviour .
Not to mention European expressions of support to Syria , which , let it be noted , whilst being a member of the UN Security Council , has for years functioned as a training camp and base for Lebanese and Palestinian terrorist networks !
The likelihood of an accident varies widely among different regions and continents .
Visits of one’s own free will are already in practice affected by the attempt to demand thirty-nine items of personal data on each and every passenger on transatlantic flights , including the choice of meals as a means towards determining whether someone is a Moslem .
Moreover , and this is perhaps the worst of all , there was also talk of restricting freedom of speech .
The question is now how we in this House should respond to this .
The proposal for revision , submitted by the Commission , is more flexible ; it takes the inflexibility out of the existing directive and is , as such , an improvement .
However , the legal basis of the directive is the environment .
In short , there is confusion all round .
We could copy the example of the blue flag .
As a result , the higher standards are somewhat questionable .
Are we not more likely to run the risk that such beaches will simply no longer be designated as bathing water , while people continue to swim in it ?
Together with the improvements introduced by the Commission , I think that , on balance , we will arrive at improved legislation after all , on the understanding , of course , that Europe should legislate in this area .     Mr President , the quality of bathing water has improved .
The amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy are good , except for Amendment No 19 .
After all , even with these new standards in place , 1 in 20 bathers fall ill , so the standards are certainly not too high .
This is why the placing of signs with information at the relevant locations – although labour-intensive in terms of maintenance – is the best solution , because it will reach the highest number of bathers .     – Mr President , first of all , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur warmly on the conclusion in his explanatory statement .
Stricter quality is now being enforced – I have nothing against stricter quality – and Parliament would like to extend the directive 's scope to include all forms of recreation .
The share of emissions of non-mobile machinery has increased relatively speaking , precisely because of the success of engine cleaning techniques used in lorries .
In this respect , the rule that applies elsewhere should also apply here , namely that the sector is given a reasonable amount of time , coupled to technological development , to carry out the necessary innovations .
This means that the environmental benefit from freight trains and inland waterway vessels is completely back to what it used to be , something with which we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance are delighted .     – Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I am delighted that the campaign that we , together with a few members of our group , have launched will bear fruit .
We should not point the finger only at the United States .
We would thus ask for a maintenance policy for European end-of-life vessels .
It also promotes the understanding of other cultures .
This requires sound cooperation among European universities and the universities from the developing countries , which must have the broadening of knowledge and experience of students and lecturers as a priority .     – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , probably few topics are discussed in this Parliament on which there is consensus within this House .
I am therefore stressing that it is not only students from third countries who should be encouraged to have a command of at least two EU languages .
Grandmothers can chat online with their grandchildren – I am an expert at it .
I have attended the prize-giving ceremony and I was deeply impressed with what was on offer , to which this prize gives a boost .
We were able to eliminate a whole range of problems , as there were quite a few differences between the common position and our first reading .
The European Parliament wants to proceed
