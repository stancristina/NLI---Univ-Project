serious is that the Commission , in its proposal of July , seems to be edging towards positions which are far removed from those of the European Parliament .
Amendment No 4 in particular seems to me to reduce the scope of supervision too far .
A number of points condemn any discrimination - it restates in this respect the contents of the resolutions on human rights adopted on every month , on a Thursday , by the European Parliament .
I only wish to say to its author that , although a fervent believer in the insertion and integration of a large population within European society , I regrettably have no intention of actively promoting the foundation of a Euro-Islamic university within the territory of the European Union , nor of encouraging the vocational training of imams , nor of implementing many other actions to suit religious rites .
Furthermore , much of Averroës ' work in its original Greek has been irretrievably lost .
Of course , there are men of intelligence in Islam who would like to see an end to the Islamic law which , as noted by my excellent colleague Mrs Seillier , currently represents a theocracy which , at the very least , is unsuited to the modern world .
Basically , we must make a personal investment in all these areas .
Russia has a powerful president governing a phantom State .
This must be enshrined in the constitution , which will put an end to the unproductive infighting which has set each centre of power against the other , resulting in paralysis .
Firstly , I am happy to note that no one here is considering abandoning our great neighbour and major partner .
This is where we must target the bulk of our advice and aid , Mr President , while hoping that the Primakov government can rise to the enormous challenge weighing on its shoulders .
If the State is now powerless and unable to regularly pay its officials , this is surely primarily because the Duma refused to adopt the tax code and buried the proposed tax system under a mountain of amendments .
The world order has changed , and to ignore this would be irresponsible .
The administrations of the Member States , whatever the criticisms which we sometimes lay at their doors , are proven administrations which take into account almost all business movements .
We hope that the move towards a social market economy is assessed in each country concerned according to the institutional capacity of these countries to manage and regulate this .
And yet , cooperation and friendship between Europe and Russia are needed more now than ever .
Kosovo and the Balkans are a thorn in our side .
It is too late for Russia : it has committed irreversible acts ; it has used up its international credit ; it has literally refused to pay its debts .
That is why the European Union and in particular the euro zone must assume their responsibilities faced with this worldwide chaos .
How can we not consider taking into account , in our perception of how to implement market economy reforms , the social and environmental dimensions of these reforms ?
On behalf of the French members of this group , I would like to call for a separate vote on the word 'political ' since , whilst we are in favour of their right to vote at local elections , we are not in favour of the right to vote in national elections .
To check this , I suggest that this text be referred back to the committee responsible , as happened with the Bösch report .
Nothing .
Therefore , I am formally asking the Commission to take urgent action to allow our rice producers to continue with the 1998 harvest and to allow our cooperatives to stockpile our production .
In our opinion , such a philosophy will not lead to the construction of Europe , but rather to its destruction .
Mr President , last July the Europe of Nations Group spoke out against the actions of the Commission which , having been condemned by the Court of Justice for implementing expenditure without the appropriate legal basis , then came to Parliament and asked for its support .
In its judgment of 12 May , the Court of Justice highlighted these requirements .
The Commission 's role should be to advise and to provide the necessary tools for a certain degree of convergence between Member States , not to intervene in a policing or fiscal capacity .
Of course we must help , but we must first punish those who do not respect the law .
But if we are to believe Maimonides and the Catalan philosopher Raymond Lulle , Averroës could be the man who wrote the booklet ' The Three Impostors ' about the Hebrew , Christian and Muslim religions .
Of all Spaniards , he is the one which has left the deepest imprint on human thought . '
In his work ' Politics' , Aristotle explains that all democratic cities are culturally uniform and that uncontrolled immigration can destroy the city .
We voted against the report drawn up by our colleague Mr Mohamed Alí on ' Islam and European Averroës Day ' .
Such an initiative would be a way of honouring Averroës 's memory , whose thinking was undeniably important for European philosophers but - and this does not bode well - his thinking was not as important for the Muslim world .
And the reason for this is very simple ; Europe should be European and Turkey is not European .
My second comment is related to the MEDA programme .
Azerbaijan is very close to us and we could conceivably draw up a far-reaching plan which , using Georgia as a platform , would create an area of stability in this region
