political agreement will be achieved , the people of Kosovo will be settled under the new agreements , and the Serbian people will more easily put the ghosts of the past , which they too find oppressive , behind them .
However , the agreement also has a number of shortcomings and disadvantages .
And finally , this agreement will have to prove itself in practice if we are to welcome it as we welcomed the agreement in Ireland a short while ago : the whole of Parliament gave that agreement a standing ovation for ten minutes .
An agreement of this type needs to be sincere and to look towards peaceful , political solutions which are fair and even-handed to all sides .
I see no point in continuing with my speech , since neither the relevant Commissioner nor the Council is present .
And the same question applies to Bosnia now and will apply tomorrow to Tetovo and the day after tomorrow to other regions which speakers here who like to solve all our problems at a stroke will hear about for the first time .
It must prove itself in the long term , otherwise we will for ever be reacting spasmodically .
It has potential in Yugoslavia , Palestine and Ireland , and there is no need to rush to resort to arms .
Fourthly , it is important that we should stress the framework within which developments in Kosovo - full autonomy while at the same time respecting the existing frontiers in the Balkans - are to take place .
In light of these developments the Green Paper should first consider and highlight the connection between convergence and the way the market is being controlled more and more by monopoly interests , the prospect of vertical integration in the sector , the imposition of restrictive policies and the control of critical resources and services , and the consequences for employment and labour relations .
In fact dealing with the crisis will entail coordinated action and international cooperation , which unfortunately does not seem to be happening at the moment , especially between countries whose currencies occupy an important position in the world economy .
However , it should be noted that in the early stages of a profiteering raid , well organised and coordinated intervention by the central banks can have the effect of preventing profiteering from getting out of hand .
If the conditions are otherwise , then they will naturally hold on to those assets .
I therefore think that we should have been rather more conservative in the amendments we tabled , and for that reason my group , having consulted those who introduced those amendments , would prefer not to adopt this rather superficial and premature approach to the problem .
The plant has 6 high-pressure water reactors of Soviet design , numbers 1 to 4 of which are of the VVR 440 230 type and are among the most antiquated and the most dangerous .
Since 1991 the European Union has granted more than ECU 50 million from PHARE for improving the station 's nuclear safety , and more than ECU 70 million for the adoption of short-term urgent measures in the traditional energy sector .
That has already been made clear in a letter from President Santer to the Bulgarian authorities .
Capacity for the storage of radioactive waste has already been exceeded , with the result that it is now being stored temporarily at the site where the Koslodui station is located .
We must therefore act very promptly before it is too late .
Yet , the basic problem that concerns me is the level of support for nuclear energy , the dangers involved , and the real costs .
And not just those of Soviet design .
We have information from France and Spain which puts the cost at tens of billions of francs , and which indicates that possibly as many as ten years may be needed for decommissioning , which is a further cost factor and one that cannot be calculated .
Tens of thousands of hectares are destroyed every year throughout the European Union , especially in southern areas and more disastrously still in Greece .
Unless we decide to adopt an organised forestry policy with the necessary resources for the research , science and technology needed to prevent and combat fires , what we are debating today is only so much hot air and there will be very painful economic , social and ecological disasters .
My first concern is that this regulation seems to enjoy varying and rather disappointing degrees of success in different countries , as I think is only natural given that it was designed to reduce agricultural production and to use the development of forests as a vehicle for doing so .
The last speaker said that situations vary .
Of course they do .
This does not mean that the same policy will apply to all islands .
That , of course , does not mean that the same measures would be adopted in Finland and in Greece !
I would like to mention two points concerning the situation in Greece .
Greece is a typical example of the latter , and I confess that I felt a certain envy when listening to what happens in Finland .
The characteristic picture in Greek families with students finishing high-school is that in the evening , when the father or mother get home from work , the 17 - or 18-year-old child sits there reciting the book to them from memory , because self-testing is not good enough .
In that sense , I think a general impetus to promote libraries , one which would attach special importance to those concerned with the languages and cultures of other EU countries , would be a very positive development .
