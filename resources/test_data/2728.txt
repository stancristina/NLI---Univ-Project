protection , and that , in all cases , we must guarantee − as happens in certain countries , such as Belgium or Italy for example − that , in order to encourage them to denounce their procurers , their right to residence after making that complaint is recognised .
This is a difficult problem that requires cooperation at European level .
The Committee is going to produce an initiative report , the rapporteur for which will be Mr Papastamkos .
We shall have to assess jointly whether the necessary , though not sufficient , conditions are in place to achieve a global agreement .
Finally , with regard to the situation of the emerging countries , who are partners of ours , who may benefit from the ‘everything but arms ’ initiative , which is an important European initiative , and who may see their preferences eroded , how do you intend to secure the support of the countries close to us for a possible agreement in which we must create a balance between advantages and disadvantages ?
No.
There are other people who need to make progress in this field and , as other speakers have said , perhaps what has most grated in this House has been the United States’ hypocritical position with regard to the European Union in the field of agriculture and also on development issues .
As you have said , involving Parliament means involving the citizens .
The proposal is similar and the rapporteur is the same person ; I say this with respect and affection for my colleague , Mr Jarzembowski , but I believe that this proposal will also be rejected by a majority .
Europe and this Parliament must not be seen by the citizens as an instrument for unbridled capitalism .
It is fundamental for the Member States to guarantee the recognition of a method for the provision of port services that contributes to the genuine development of short-distance sea transport , which , by its very nature , requires efficiency and speed not just in customs operations , but also , in particular , in loading and unloading .
Based on my conviction , therefore , that this Parliament will do what it has to do and reject this proposal , which has amply demonstrated its inadequacy in terms of the current needs of European ports , I would ask the Commissioner to be sensitive , as he has shown himself to be in other areas of transport , and , because the global situation requires it , as soon as possible to prepare an updated , necessary and courageous consultation process which deals openly and thoroughly with all of the necessary aspects of European ports .
This last issue , ladies and gentlemen , is a genuine obstacle to the beginning of negotiations and we believe that the European Union must maintain a very firm and demanding position towards our Russian partners .
In this regard , his particular reference to the move from national airlines to European airlines is extremely hopeful .
Finally , I would like to say that , in the case of the application that is taking place within the agreements or the requirement for environmental rules and legislation on social rights , we would like this negotiation to move increasingly towards international rules that are closer to the stricter European rules , in other words , they should be harmonised upwards .
Not one .
Has the Commission looked into any financial aid for preventing fires and alleviating their effects in the rural areas in question ?     Mr President , I would like firstly to congratulate Mr Fruteau on the effort he has made to improve the Commission ’s proposal , which represents a u-turn in what has been the European Union 's policy on the sugar sector since 1968 and which , furthermore , is going to put an end to sugar beet cultivation in many regions of the European Union .
These countries are being penalised , while an extra quota is being provided for the large producers of C sugar .
Some of us have been working to reach agreements , to bring positions closer together , in order to achieve what in the end has become a reality .
In the future , we must prevent Parliament 's voice from being ignored again in such a blatant manner , particularly on decisions with such significant economic and social importance .
I believe that the Århus Convention , which is already being transposed in some countries , such as Spain , is clearly a victory for the possibility of transparency , training and so forth .
The main principle , which we have raised here many times , is that the concept of sustainable development is integral , it must relate to a specific place , and in one place certain things can be done for economic and social reasons which cannot be done in another place .
Furthermore , the right to promote the administrative or legal resources they consider appropriate must be recognised when it is judged that those rights have been violated by public administrations .
I believe that it is important to stress – whenever I am teaching in the future , I shall explain this to my students – that this is a genuine example of the extent to which environmental policy is an added value for the economic system , for the wellbeing of the citizens and also in terms of increased land values .
Nevertheless , six months may be long enough to point out the appropriate direction for this change and rectification that the European Union requires .
We need to do some political work in order to make the public aware of what the European Union and its institutions are doing in these fields
