' s priority is to get out of the particular country , not to get into one .
Barring exceptional circumstances it is not unreasonable to expect that someone escaping from oppression would apply for sanctuary as soon as he reached a safe state .
I am proud of Britain' s role through the centuries as a safe haven for those fleeing from injustice and wrong and I know that Members across this House will feel a similar pride in the honourable record of their countries .
That record depends on our ability to distinguish between economic migrants and genuine refugees and it depends critically on our having the resolve to secure our borders against false claimants .
As cooperating states we can do this , as a single territory the evidence suggests that we cannot .
Mr President , each of the countries referred to in this report is different and each of the plans varies accordingly .
I will speak only about Sri Lanka , a country I have visited , and a country many of whose citizens have sought refuge in London and other parts of the European Union .
It is a country , President , in which a civil war has raged for the past eighteen years - eighteen years which have seen the proportion of defence spending by the Sri Lankan government rise steadily .
This money is spent fighting a war that the Sri Lankan government cannot win and it is a war that the Tamils cannot win either .
The only solution must be a brokered peace .
It could be that the European Union , with its historical links , could act as that intermediary .
My colleague , Anna Terrón , has said that this report is naïve .
I feel that the report skirts around the real issue and is a diversion from the debate that we ought to be having on Sri Lanka and the other countries .
The report says that there is no end to the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka .
It speaks of human rights abuses , cases of aid not reaching the most desperate areas and of economic deprivation .
That is the effect of the war and it says that we should work more closely with the Sri Lankan government .
Yet it is they who are controlling what we know and it is they who control what coverage we get and we must be circumspect .
We all know about the well-publicised cases of Tamil action against government forces .
We have heard less about the hospitals and schools being destroyed and of torture by Sri Lankan government troops .
So when the report says , Mr President , that we should look for ways to find a political solution to this conflict , I agree .
Nothing else matters .
Nothing else will solve the problems or lessen the human rights abuses .
Nothing short of a cessation of the conflict will end the misery of the Tamils in Sri Lanka and nothing else will end the number of people seeking refuge in the European Union .
Nothing else will stop people from fleeing the country .
A high-level action plan , Mr President , that does not recognise these fundamental reports is - I would argue - not worth the paper it is written on .
Mr President , I welcome this procedure this year because it is the earliest start we have ever had and this will enable us , I hope , to give more serious consideration and more detailed consideration as the process develops .
So I treat this as a beginning and not an end .
As a beginning , I would say the Environment Committee would like to reiterate the demands it made last year with regard to the budget .
We have a persistent and clear need to continue to work towards greening the budget in all areas of policy activity and I want to see further work on this this year .
In addition , we are spending a lot of money on our external policies , particularly through the PHARE and TACIS programmes , on ways of developing the important role of the environment and the sustainable development of those areas so close to our own borders .
I want to see more work from the Commission showing us how that money is being properly and correctly applied and what the positive outcomes are .
I also want to give more consideration to what the agencies are doing and take a more differentiated approach to them depending on their particular roles and activities which we have not done in the past .
In particular we want to consider the problems that the Treaty of Amsterdam presents and the fact that the full financial implications of the Treaty of Amsterdam are only being realised this year and we have to take account of that .
The committee also wants to reiterate its support for continued financial assistance to NGO participation in much of the technical committee work of the Parliament and the Commission .
Finally , Mr President , I would say that we continue to oppose the tobacco subsidies which are continuously being paid by the Commission and the sooner we get a chance to do something about it the better .
That is the view of this Parliament .
Mr President , I would like to start off by congratulating Mr Ferber on excellent guidelines .
I welcome the clear orientation of the report to planning for enlargement .
The drive towards efficiency is especially vital in the context of enlargement .
It is important even at this early stage that we have a clear strategy on how the institutions will respond to the accession of new members .
We need to be imaginative about how we address the issues of staffing and building requirements .
