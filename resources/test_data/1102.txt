Turkey cannot demand a date in Copenhagen .
Galicia lives by the sea , and the sea was destroyed by merchant criminals who sail along the coast in old tankers full of oil .
It is a particularly bad state of affairs and reference is often made to the situation in Newfoundland , where fishing has gone on to the point where the Grandbanks are empty , but we should also set in motion drastic measures to stop excessive fishing .
This is an example of hasty , rather than careful , decision-making , with a negative result .
We should think of alternatives , think in terms of cutting the link with flatfish , and consider setting up a compensation fund .
There is , of course , the warming of sea water to some extent , but we should also examine the probable causes of overfishing in the first place .
It is unacceptable for fishermen to have to suffer extra for sole and plaice .
At the same time victims of trafficking in human beings are victims of a whole range of abuses and criminal practices .
This proposal for a directive is however based on thorough practical knowledge of experts active in the field .
Allow me to say a few words on two other points .
The risk of kidnappings or even of manipulation and intimidation is also very real .
Mr President , the Commission 's proposal is a creditable attempt as a Union , to get a better grip on smuggling of human beings and trafficking in human beings .
This directive in fact affects a different group of people from those in the UN protocol .
Especially as legislation in this area exists only in Spain .
And with more power for the European Council , as some want , we will of course be breaking the balance between the institutions .
And at the same time , the struggle over the choice of whether or not we have a social Europe .
I am also pleased that this document is so very much in keeping with Parliament 's position and that it is also so much in tune with the Benelux Memorandum that has just come out .
If you divide the work up in this way , then the President of the Commission will have rather more freedom to take on these presidential duties .
Consequently , Mr Prodi , you have our full support .
It says that it must be decided by the Council , having been prepared by the Commission , and then in brackets we have 'where appropriate after consulting the European Parliament ' .
Do you start with the economic or do you start with the social ?
This is important if we are to bring this to a successful conclusion .
Yet we have to be careful that no new injustice arises .
According to this line of thinking , the expected drawbacks concerning labour and the environment are automatically offset by an increase in profits and employment .
.
This money would be better spent on mass public transport , namely city transport and local transport , which is experiencing cutbacks everywhere .
Despite the dangers at sea , many fishermen would ideally like to carry on , and even for those who would like a change , no replacement employment is being organised .
.
If the seas in those areas soon run out of fish stocks , as the North Sea is doing , those countries will be left with an insoluble problem .
In response to the criticism of preferential treatment , a statute for MEPs was discussed in 1998 and in 2002 .
Not only the health , housing and income of those victims deserve support , but also their opportunity to witness in a legal court against punishable offences and to claim damages from those who made money from them .
These proposals were more inspired by practical political considerations than by justified concern for poor cod levels .
It is high time we did something about this .
She is therefore right to call for a proposal to step up this directive before the end of 2003 , aimed at better control , a compulsory ethical evaluation procedure , a ban on experiments on primates caught in the wild and also a ban on animal abuse for the development of chemical weapons and cosmetics .
You know , Mr President , that I have already mentioned this and I have not heard anything from the Commission over the past four weeks .
We are currently debating the Napolitano report , and are trying to get it endorsed here with a view to better anchoring down the foundation of our European home in the European constitution at both local and regional level .
In this respect , I endorse the views of Mrs Kaufmann and Mrs Frassoni .
This is necessary because this illness-inducing substance has for far too long been treated as the solution for everything , because dwellings and industrial buildings in Eastern Europe contain high levels of Russian asbestos and because also people other than those handling asbestos can become affected .
Mr President , Commissioner , first of all , the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs would like to join the others and extend its best wishes for a speedy recovery to Mrs Dami√£o , the original rapporteur , and also congratulate Mr Hughes on his work as the deputy and much more .
This automatically leads to the need for legislation and directives in those countries , but also sanctions , hence also an amendment .
However , it would be unfair to say that food is irradiated for the wrong reasons - in order to give it a better appearance , or to disguise any imperfections .
From the above , I conclude
