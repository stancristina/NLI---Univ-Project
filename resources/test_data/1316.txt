These elements are , of course , of crucial importance , particularly for the poorer sections of the world 's population .
It is also related to the issue of environmentally harmful subsidies , something that we know Commissioner Wallström wishes to address in the EU.
I am , however , somewhat surprised about the comments by Commissioner Nielson on this score .
Johannesburg was not a success .
This is why it is logical that these G77 countries have focused on the traditional fight against poverty and for clean drinking water , sanitary facilities and energy for the poor .
If it is impossible to conclude a treaty at world level , Europe should at least act consistently on its own patch .
Why does the European Commission not suggest that a clear label be introduced for timber and timber products ?
This is hardly a balance , therefore .
When will this happen ?
The implementation of the goals will certainly need to make a contribution to this .
It is true that the often ageing diesel locomotives should become cleaner and that the canal network has been neglected .
As a result , employers ' interests have weighed down heavily on the EU 's management structures and EU policy .
Given a declining economy and growing unemployment , the neo-liberal approach is a recipe for certain social disaster .
The pressure on Saddam Hussein to allow unfettered access to all weapons and to destroy all dangerous weapons must be stepped up to the highest level possible .
If that does not change , we only have ourselves to blame for America being able to take global control on its own .
Although it is in place , it is not enforceable , not at European level or in our countries .
The problem , however , does not only lie in the country of origin .
This represents a serious misconception and analytical error .
I beg you , Mr Yiannitsis , spare us all a disappointment in this respect .
The need for joint EU action has never been so great and , as you said yourself , support among the people has never been so great .
I fully endorse Mr Titley 's remark about the absolute need for multilateral discussion once one Member State has refused a licence .
This was most recently illustrated by the very harsh words in the national security plan that is being presented this week .
And I would urge Mr Möller to draw the line there in respect of the Council 's willingness to strike a compromise .
This is exactly where the present resolution on the Criminal Court falls short .
Only in a politically calm climate can the Court develop more legitimacy and , one may hope , persuade countries such as the US to gradually leave behind their objections to this Court .
Needless to say , it was to be expected that some states would object to this Court .
This follows on from the criteria of Copenhagen .
Europe 's criticism would therefore gain more weight if the European Union were to accept a more proportionate share of the operations under the wings of the UN , which still needs to be negotiated , in fact .
The International Criminal Court 's very existence is on the line , as destructive bilateral agreements undermine its raison d 'être .
This is why I would ask Member States to abandon destructive bilateral agreements with the US , and urge the Council to remain united .
We are now talking about an improved generation of catalytic converters that are about to be used .
It would be unfortunate if they abstained from the vote tomorrow , for then we would be unable to achieve the required majority .
The improvement , which will reduce noise and exhaust to some degree , has been adopted by the Commission .
Organic lubricant is used on the famous lake in the Alps , for example , which we talked about earlier , where it is compulsory .
The resolution links this to a statement by the Security Council about the result of the inspections .
Meanwhile , the Dutch Schiphol airport remains the link and focal point of the arms trade between the USA and Israel .
Problems will arise in the current Member States , which will undoubtedly be faced with a major , fresh wave of immigration , but also in the candidate countries when their highly trained people , engineers , doctors , nurses , construction workers and many more will almost certainly , for financial reasons , leave their countries to find a better paid job elsewhere in Europe .
We , however , have not shown the same level of commitment to forcefully implementing the changes that are necessary to fashion this real Europe .
Hence the need for us to inform our citizens of what is at stake .
We said in Parliament at the time that the loose ends should be few and short .
This is transgressing the rules of decency .
The contribution to this by new members may be significant in this respect too .
We already know this and we should be prepared for this .
This is why I wonder whether the Council is not a little too upbeat .
This is currently the case with , for example , the directive on working conditions for temporary staff .
As I have already said , we are still facing a difficult situation in the area of employment .
At the moment , the transnational labour and knowledge potential that is available is still very much under-utilised , and this must improve .
I shall keep my comments brief , for small groups have little speaking time .
How can we sum this up ?
My final point concerns Mr Bushill-Matthews ' report .
The xenophobic campaign in the
