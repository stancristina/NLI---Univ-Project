I also said this at the meetings I had on 3 July and again last week in New York .
We must hope that the United States can be prevailed upon to adopt a more positive approach once the International Criminal Court has in practice had the opportunity to show that it operates in accordance with the highest standards of the rule of law and does not allow itself to be exploited for political reasons .
Madam President , the setting up of the International Criminal Court is of course a quantum leap in the struggle for human rights .
It is clear , in my view , that the United States is trying to make use of its position as a superpower merely to take care of its own narrow interests .
An International Criminal Court without American participation is naturally a weakened court .
A legal system neither can nor should be set up in that way .
Madam President , I should like to thank Parliament for its very strong interest in safeguarding and preserving the ICC.
That is also the Danish Presidency 's attitude , moreover .
The EU countries should also ideally offer the same response to the United States .
It should be borne in mind that the task of offering the United States a response is a bilateral one .
It is not for the Commission to respond to the United States ' representations .
That is all we can do , but I also assume that the recommendation will be followed .
I agree completely with Mr Lund that we must not have a cosmetic and phoney compromise .
We are of the view that we must have a global court which will have an effective deterrent effect upon those war crimes described in the statutes of the court .
We have discussed the matter on several occasions with the United States , but to no avail .
With this in view , the bilateral approaches can be used to devise an agreement along the lines that I mentioned and that are not at all different from those mentioned by Commissioner Patten .
If wordings can be devised whereby the United States becomes part of the international legal system without being a member of the ICC , that is nonetheless to be preferred to a situation in which the United States is excluded from , and does not have , any such legal system .
That , moreover , is what our efforts are designed to achieve .
I should like to point out that the United States does not want to see exemption from prosecution , either .
That has never been the desire on the part of the United States .
It is a question of it wanting to do the punishing itself .
This is apparent from the letter written by Mr Powell to the individual countries , and also from the remarks he made to the European Union at our ministerial meeting with him .
There is a principle of subsidiarity .
That is of course the principle .
I also assume that Denmark itself would bring prosecutions , meaning that I do not anticipate any Dane 's ending up in The Hague .
I anticipate our prosecuting war criminals ourselves , if we have any .
It must , then , be the task of the actual country concerned to say that a particular matter is so serious as to be something that we ourselves should no doubt deal with .
Against that background , I therefore cherish a reasonably justified hope that we can grope our way towards a solution whereby the ICC remains unaffected and with its integrity preserved , while still more countries undertake to prosecute war criminals than is the case at present .
There will be no compromise whereby the court is weakened and the crimes concerned go unpunished .
Particularly through the GSP 's generalised systems , they can , as Mr Bar√≥n Crespo mentioned , be given the opportunity to increase their own export income , promote industrialisation in their own countries and speed up the diversification of their economies as a stability tool .
They are not subject to the dictates of the European Council or to joint decision-making by the European Council .
It is therefore up to these states themselves , and not to the Council , to decide how they are to conduct themselves in these international financial bodies .
It is nonetheless clear that coordination between the EU Member States in relation to Article 19 of the EU Treaty may be of benefit to their work in these institutions .
With regard to the Member States ' efforts to remedy the situation in the Mercosur countries , they are participating fully and actively in the IMF 's work to secure stability and sustainable economic growth in the region .
The arrangements made to support Paraguay , Uruguay and , most recently , Brazil have received backing from the EU Member States , and work is being done on securing a strong , sustainable and credible IMF programme for Argentina , as outlined in the Council 's conclusions of 21 January 2002 .
The parties have not set any deadline for the conclusion of the negotiations , the date 's depending therefore upon how the negotiations progress .
The European Union has undertaken to reach a comprehensive agreement with Mercosur and make further progress in the negotiations .
It is absolutely right that it should be taken seriously .
First of all , everyone here must be aware of the need to go home and say to our own governments that they themselves must work in the IMF on behalf of the institutions and say to the Mercosur countries that , first of all , they themselves must implement the financial changes .
