Translation costs have been a considerable problem and must be reduced to make it easier for companies to be listed abroad .
This is a clearer solution than the Commission 's original proposal and will benefit both issuers and investors .
This is of course a positive move .
We achieved broad and balanced consensus regarding the necessary amendments .
I hope that we can remain in agreement in tomorrow 's vote .
The Liberal Group tried to do this back in January .
We must be clear-sighted and see that it is Vladimir Voranin who has stopped economic reforms .
For instance the Moldovan Government refused to allow the people to set up an Orthodox community attached to the Romanian Orthodox Church .
This has been condemned as contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights .
The Christian Democrat party has been mentioned .
We now have a situation where a Romanian diplomat has been declared persona non grata .
We must avoid being confronted with a new Belarus .
Mr President , in thirty years there has been a huge increase in the number of standards relating to the environment , with more than fifty times the number of national agreements , protocols and similar instruments in this area .
In general they are flawed in that they are not sufficiently specific and their implementation has been inexcusably ineffective .
The proposal for a directive , which is based on the EC Treaty and Article 175( 1 ) , is the correct instrument in this instance and , pursuant to Article 47 TEU , the Community legal instrument under the first pillar must clearly take precedence , as the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs has stated in more detail in its opinion .
The utilisation rate was 99.28 % , and the ratio of payment appropriations to all commitments was 91.05 % .
In the future this sort of practice should be done away with and we should budget strictly for actual estimated expenditure .
Parliament 's accounts are abstruse , however .
The main points of focus in the budget for 2000 were the promotion of activity based management and better allocation of human resources .
We furthermore have to change to a form of administration in which it is the results of actions that are assessed and not so much the way the administration is organised .
We must be able to redeploy human resources more flexibly and put an end to functions that are unnecessary .
The European Parliament is still a very old-fashioned place to work in .
In the last eighteen months eighteen people have been appointed to posts in categories A1 - A3 .
The report criticises this and calls for the introduction of quota arrangements until a normal state of affairs is reached .
For that reason the report requests that this special feature should be taken into account in one way or another when the Financial Regulation is amended .
In addition , the responsibility of the group as party to agreements in general and as employer in particular must be legally clarified so that the European Parliament is not always ultimately accountable .
Shortening the length of a part-session produces savings of just 1 % .
This matter would perhaps be worth looking into by the Convention dealing with Treaty reform .
No agreement has been reached concerning the final investment costs with the project 's promoter , SERS .
There are also disputes between the promoter and the subcontractors .
The city of Strasbourg and the Alsace Region have the controlling interest in SERS , owning 60 % of the shares in all .
It is unfair that Parliament should continually have to remain vigilant to ensure that it is not being billed for costs that are unjustified .
With these observations the report proposes granting discharge to the Secretary-General in respect of the implementation of the 2000 budget and to the Accounting Officer in respect of the accounts for 2000 .
Mr President , on behalf of my group , I would like to thank Mr Schmitt for the excellent work he has done in preparing this report .
To achieve these goals the Aviation Safety Agency must function as independently as possible .
The longer transitional period contained in the common position is necessary to allow time for the Member States to replace the current complicated regulatory and certification procedures with certificates .
Although air traffic has always been a relatively safe form of transport , its growth , as well as airport and airspace congestion have increased the risk of accident .
Close cooperation between Member States for the purpose of raising levels of civil aviation safety will be an important precaution as air traffic grows .
In my opinion we should move towards a compromise as quickly as possible and avoid conciliation .
We in Europe enjoy high levels of air safety but the growth in traffic continually obliges us to take more effective action .
National pride must make way for rational cooperation .
The concentration of information and harmonisation of standards are essential for the prevention of accidents , but regulations should not normally be tightened up only after accidents have occurred ; instead , there should be a systematic analysis of present and future risks .
That , again , will not succeed unless all the Member States have the same tools at their disposal .
The Aviation Safety Agency should make decisions that apply to the world as a whole , whenever that is possible .
Parma 's excellent food , such as its ham , would guarantee the contentment of the authorities working there and , hopefully , some equally mature decisions for air safety and the private individual in Europe .
This must be the objective of all of us , and that objective must be achieved soon .
The Palestinian leaders have not shown themselves to be
