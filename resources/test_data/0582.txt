There is to be a commitment to majority decision-making in this area .
The most significant legacy of the European Council ' s summit in Lisbon is all the unresolved problems .
Mr President , I should like to thank the Commissioner and the President-in-Office of the Council for their reports on the Cairo summit and say how really surprising I think it is that there has never been a summit of this kind before .
Will anything come out of a meeting of this kind ?
Well , that probably depends upon how you look at it .
If you start by considering the disasters , famine , conflicts and problems with AIDS which Africa faces , then , as Mr Prodi says , it is certainly a long way from Lisbon to Cairo , in which case not a lot will come out of the summit .
That was not , of course , the purpose of the summit .
That dialogue was in fact initiated , and it is safe to say that , at times , it was fairly unrestrained with its demonstrations and its wrangles or , in any case , point-scoring .
I believe that the final document will prove to be an important reference point in connection with further cooperation between the EU and Africa .
Whether or not concrete results will be achieved in this way will depend , of course , upon the political will we show in the future .
I should like to thank you for your answer .
I should like to point out that what we are concerned with here is an individual citizen whose livelihood has been affected .
It is a matter costing an incredible amount of money .
As some of us who have been involved with the equine trade know , there is a great deal of money at stake here .
I would therefore ask whether it is once again necessary to make an application in connection with this matter .
I think it is a very competent piece of work , and I think some important improvements have been made to the common position .
First and foremost , I think it is right that we should now have an actual ban proposed on the use of substances which can produce resistance to antibiotics .
The second point I would make is that , unlike Mr Liese , I am in favour of including proposals to the effect that measures should , if possible , be taken to prevent gene-transfer from GMOs to other organisms , otherwise known as GMO contamination .
Instead , an attempt should be made to carry out an overall assessment of the accumulated effects of the many consents which are issued upon the fertility of the soil , the food chain , biological diversity and the health issues which are of importance to us as human beings .
I think that is a major flaw in current practice in this area .
In this connection , I also think that consents ought to be reviewed every ten years , so that they can only be issued for up to ten years at a time .
I also think it is right that this proposal should provide us with legislation ensuring that , whenever vertical legislation is enacted in specific areas , the same conditions regarding risk assessment and monitoring should be complied with as also apply in the case of the general directive .
I agree with the original proposal in Mr Bowe ' s report to the effect that businesses seeking consents should be made objectively liable and that liability insurance must also be taken out in connection with an application for consent .
I hope we shall see the adoption of these amendments designed to tighten up on the common position .
In that way , we shall , in actual fact , obtain the legal basis that should have been in place before the first consent for new GMO crops was issued .
We must be careful , however , that we do not now just sit back in the belief that we have finished our work .
We have selected an authorisation procedure which is more restrictive than its American equivalent , and this will of course be significant in terms of our ability to hold onto the best companies and researchers .
The time limits we adopt for processing applications should not , therefore , be applied as the rule but , instead , constitute an absolute maximum .
A natural consequence of Europe ' s strict authorisation procedure must be that the authorities assume a portion of the liability .
Consumers require information about where the animal was born , bred and slaughtered , and cattle should be identified and registered so that their traceability can be guaranteed .
The issue is also one of credibility when it comes to implementing joint resolutions in all Member States .
A bit of drive needs to be shown , and no exceptions should be made in the case of cattle which graze in the mountains .
I am in favour of beef being labelled with the name of the country or countries it comes from and I am strongly against introducing a common EU label from which consumers cannot see which countries are involved .
The purpose of the regulation in question must be to achieve a situation in which consumers have confidence in meat from all EU countries .
Until this is a reality , consumers need to know precisely which country their meat comes from .
In this way , I wished to ensure that small and medium-sized slaughterhouses could continue to supply meat to butchers .
