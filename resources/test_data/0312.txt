.
Third contradiction : while trying to use Community regulation to ward off the danger of other epidemics in the future , the Commission is continuing to water the seed bed in which such epidemics can grow , by proposing a framework for an ultra-productivist agriculture , based on the lowest prices in the world market , in its Agenda 2000 programme .
This is the essential reason why I am abstaining from the final resolution .
To keep rigorous control over the Commission , we do not need , as is proposed in the compromise resolution - with which we do not agree with on this point - to extend codecision to agricultural expenditure .
For this purpose , no manoeuvre , no trickery , no felony has been spared .
I am a socialist member of Parliament , and I believe that the participation of workers should enable the regulation and influence of the great free market which is being imposed upon us .
The recent lorry drivers ' conflict in France highlights the risk of social dumping , of an open market , without commonly accepted social and labour relations standards .
Now we understand why the budgetary framework of Agenda 2000 was not bold enough in the eyes of the report .
We should not lose sight of this idea , and of the necessity of this point of view , when we come to the study of the reform of the structural funds .
Unemployment , insecurity , immigration , tax , drugs , loss of identity , ageing of the population : this reality is not social cohesion , but generalized social disintegration .
I may therefore be in agreement with the demands contained in the report of our two colleagues at the institutional level .
It would be better even so to ratify the treaty .
We could have adopted a more radical position , especially as our expectations were so high , and our hopes so dashed .
I think the question was already settled in July .
Mr President , Mr Minister , Mr Commissioner , it goes without saying , and hence I shall not take up further time on this point , that our group is perfectly aware of the extreme importance of the relationships between the European Union and the United States of America , and that we wish for them to be reinforced within the framework of the new transatlantic agenda .
Shortfalls in this field , or even the absence of such policies , will have perceptible effects , not only in the field of foreign policy as such , in Yugoslavia , the Middle East , Africa , or elsewhere , but also in the commercial field .
Furthermore , leaving such legislation on the books unchanged may only encourage other lobbies to mobilize and - at the federal , state , and local authority levels - impose new legislations with extra-territorial effect , as we have seen with Massachusetts .
Not a word about the discussion which might affect the steel market , the electrical construction markets , the agricultural markets , where America is wholly dominant .
Let it be said clearly : this treaty is not up to the challenges and ambitions of European construction , which should , in less than five years from now , have completed single currency , enlargement , the fight against employment , political Europe , and social Europe .
Only the European bars reacted spontaneously , by expressing their opposition to reform .
It is unacceptable .
Instead of making good the democratic deficit , it is increasing the democratic deficit .
Personally , I have doubts about that , and I would like to say that , under the current circumstances , we must establish positive dialogue with all moderate elements , belonging to all the factions , once they have opted for democratization and for the rule of law .
I must admit , this is a question to which I would not wish to give a wrong answer .
This is a purely personal viewpoint , which would perhaps make it possible to avoid a number of controls , which are , so to speak , unfortunate or heavy-handed .
The strategy which the European Union may well adopt is one of continuous dialogue at all levels , a dialogue which will make it possible to progress on a step by step basis .
I believe that if the Commission , with proof to hand , can demonstrate other more efficient means to react to the problem , it will be the Council 's responsibility to take these decisions , and take its appropriate share of responsibility .
On the other hand , I do not know which ambassador you had in mind when you were speaking , but to me it does not appear that this ambassador had a very sophisticated understanding of medicine .
The honourable Member is being too kind to me .
We nevertheless wish to emphasize here the urgency of a more determined momentum in one of the fields raised by the action plan , that of taxation .
At the same time , specific ( albeit marginal ) powers should be reserved for the Union , in terms of setting VAT levels , for this would make it possible to bring into play timely corrections in VAT rates at the European level .
It will be quite the opposite , as everyone knows .
It presents the advantage of establishing long term objectives and this is something we should welcome .
The state control level seems to us to be the most suitable .
We are well aware that nations are quite often complacent even if , out loud , they denounce the Mafia .
Tobacco and alcohol are freely available for sale , and yet look at the situation there !
