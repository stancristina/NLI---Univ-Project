Firstly , everyone agrees on the need to ban human cloning , which is hardly surprising .
Science is obviously an issue , not just science however , but also the social and political system in which science evolves .
It would also give far more influence to an ethical committee that is chaired by a person of unblemished reputation , Mrs NÃ¶elle Lenoir , who also works for the Council of Europe and who has a very wide following , even outside Europe .

We should certainly not take state capitalism measures and make the tax-payer pay for the loss of productivity ; on the other hand we should certainly pursue a concerted policy of boosting demand and take support , reconversion and flanking measures , making more use of the structural funds , as was done for the mining and shipbuilding industries .
I think it is now vital to consider how to distribute social powers between the states and the European Union , but also to consider how to formulate a European industrial strategy .
Secondly , I am thinking of the inevitable retaliatory measures the consumers will spontaneously take by boycotting all products made in France which , in the final analysis , are far from irreplaceable .
The Europeans will turn against Europe unless it formulates a genuine industrial policy that is in their service , provides public financing of research that matches up to the requirements , opens a social dialogue worthy of that name .

What our fishermen need , on the contrary , is for the rules of the game to remain stable .
It is true that there are opposing economic arguments : the hundreds of Spanish fishermen , who are , moreover , Carmen Fraga 's voters , and the Italians .
The Commission , in its wisdom - which is rare , and therefore worthy of comment - has finally , for once , arrived at a sort of compromise , which originated with the United Nations , and which the UNO itself adopted in 1989 : a 2.5 km net instead of a 5 km net .
