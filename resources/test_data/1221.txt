Our group is reviewing a few amendments that were rejected by the committee .
This is such an important matter for consideration that firm conclusions have to drawn .
The Commission would have abolished URBAN , but this time Parliament drew the longer straw .
The majority of the population of Europe live in cities , and their problems are among the most pressing within the context of regional policy and very complex matters in themselves .
None of us wants South American type favelas in Europe .
We always come back to the same basic problem in Europe : our economy does not support the individual sufficiently , nor is it sufficiently dynamic .
The economy has to be strong for us to be able to attend to the problems of our fellow-citizens and our environment .
It is good that spending has become focused , as otherwise the buckshot gets scattered to the four winds .
The basis for all this is that we should be encouraging individual innovation and entrepreneurship , as group action begun by the individual will help revitalise an area internally .
Madam President , Mr President of the Commission , I greatly admire the openness with which you admit that the European Union must change fundamentally .
At the same time , however , it has to be said that , unfortunately , your programme reminds me in many ways of a party manifesto .
There are a lot of good intentions in it , but it very much lacks concrete proposals concerning how this can all be achieved .
I would like to take this opportunity to help you recognise them .
Should we at long last be drafting convergence criteria , in which - as you in fact hint at in this programme - the aim would be that unemployment in no Member State should be higher than , say , the three most successful countries in this matter ?
Do please raise this issue at the intergovernmental conference .
One contradiction within your programme relates to globalisation .
I think it is very creditable that you should mention the concept of 'global administration ' , as others too have said here .
You must embark on a dialogue with the international community .
We can submit motions for this together with you .
We have to table motions proposing that our citizens might really have a direct impact on decision-making .
Mr President , Commissioner , this is a very important directive .
The public must have a right to clean water .
We must make sure that we get started quickly with the programme to improve water quality .
It is important that the timetable is an ambitious one .
I would like to comment on one issue , which was spoken about earlier .
I believe the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy has restricted too tightly the debate on the transfer of water .
The entry into force of the treaties and their final form is , however , in addition to this recommendation , dependent on implementation by the parties themselves .
It is worrying that the position adopted by the previous Parliament does not support this balanced WIPO system .
Parliament ' s amendments would mainly improve opportunities for the media enterprises that are well established in the market to move their old , in excess of 80 % market share to a new environment with rigid , excessive copyright regulations .
I am not now speaking of Charlotte Cederschi√∂ld ' s recommendation , which is an excellent paper , but of the matters of copyright that the previous Parliament discussed .
There is no consciously adopted position in the WIPO Treaty on temporary copies .
The real benefit of culture is that art and knowledge can be transferred safely and easily from the artist directly to the user , the consumer .
Parliament has tried to take account of this in its own recommendation .
At the same time , however , we shut our eyes to the Union ' s own problems : to the violence , inequality , and fourth world reality , which is part of everyday life in the EU.
It is absolutely right that we pay serious attention to the violations of human rights that are to be the subject of talks in Geneva .
It is nothing less than hypocritical to condemn the flagrant violation of human rights that occurs in non-EU countries if we are not prepared to extend a helping hand to those genuine refugees and asylum-seekers , whose position is now becoming more difficult in the EU.
I worked for many years on the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission and it was really moving to see how a nation in such difficult circumstances was reaching out for a more open , European-style , pluralistic democratic society .
Mr President , in Kotka , in Finland , there is currently a vessel carrying chemicals , which is sailing under a flag of convenience .
Mr President , Commissioner , the proposal for a directive now under discussion brings with it several welcome reforms to the current legal provisions .
The greater the trust consumers have in investment market operations , the more consumers will be prepared to invest on the open market .
Whether or not the money will come onto the equity market in the form of direct investment or via UCITS is not relevant here .
However , I would like to express my position with regard to a few detailed proposals .
The directive should not treat over-the-counter derivatives differently from standard derivatives because they are used in many Member States and were also used before .
With regard to Article 5g of the other proposal for a directive , the so-called Article on Delegation , I think the Commission ' s original proposal on rules concerning authorisation was better than the one now approved in the committee , so I would support
