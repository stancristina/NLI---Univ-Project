Is he able to successfully transfer assets , even after the opening of insolvency proceedings ; forum shopping as it were ?
Such procedures are then conducted as concurrent or secondary proceedings - termed territorial insolvency procedures - the effect of which , however , is confined to the territory of the country concerned .
This represents a breakthrough and could be held up as an example in my view .
The Community is prepared to co-finance 50 % of this .
Fine speeches and bitter tears are not much use .
This is the challenge Europe faces .
Ultimately , all producers , be they Israeli or Palestinian , should be afforded easier access to the European Union market once the territorial issues have been conclusively resolved , which will come step-by-step with the construction of a future Palestinian state .
We do not need any more secondary theatres of war in this complicated peace process .
There was a grave danger of this House 's reputation being damaged .
But their contribution to employment growth is overstated almost religiously by their proponents .
One important point is unfortunately missing completely from the debate , despite the fact that this House is otherwise so fond of consumer protection and mentions it so often .
This means that if we in Europe get our act together in good time then we will also be competitive in this field of new technologies .
Mr President-in-Office , you have made us in the European Parliament eager to leave for Lisbon already .
We must also recognise that we need another type of economic and financial policy .
This is the most effective way of reducing unemployment .
That would give you another ally for your policy .
However , the arguments that excessively lengthy negotiations with the Council are putting existing projects - projects which are already up and running - at risk have persuaded me otherwise .
We will start again .
This is because if the forests continue to be damaged to the same extent as they have been up until now , the local people will be the first to suffer and then we will all suffer throughout the whole world , because dramatic changes in climate can of course already be identified .
So where do we differ from the Council , apart from on minor details such as the fact that we wish to exempt museum ships from the bureaucratic rules and that we are a little stricter where large fishing vessels and recreational craft are concerned ?
I believe that in the interests of protecting the environment and of a permanently thriving tourist industry in many countries of our Community it is better to have an effective system .
The Council is after all also saying that all ports must have appropriate port reception facilities available and must be equipped with them .
We must not sit back and accept this .
That is why , on the procedure , I should like to say once more that Amendment No 3 replaces Amendment No 2 which was adopted by the committee .
That is why this is not about the question of whether we are in favour of subsidiarity or centralism .
Because of this I am glad that the report is not actually controversial and that Parliament is once again proving to be the driving force in the debate about traffic safety on Europe 's roads .
The boundaries between fairness , equal treatment , and the law of the European Union - of the European Community - are sometimes blurred .
When Parliament asks the Commission to prepare proposals , then we expect the Commission to keep its word in future and to deliver the goods .
That is not how we envisage Europe to be !
This would be a shame , not just for us MEPs - who may no longer be here in that case - but for Europe as well .
Therefore , I infer from what you have said that the European Commission will work in even closer cooperation with the European Parliament , in a spirit of openness , transparency and partnership .
Take trade policy , for example , nothing , not a single word , Mr Prodi .
You see , Mr Prodi , it is a lot more simple than you might fear .
The two do not go together .
It is difficult to imagine us amending the Treaty without the consent of Germany ' s LÃ¤nder , for example .
I would willingly support you there if I knew what you meant by this .
You have our full backing on this as well , for money laundering is partly what motivates organised crime .
Of course I picked up a few tips for the Commission along the way , as well as a log book which has been a must for every fisherman since 1 January 2000 .
Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , you should look to the right !
Mr President of the Commission , please tell Mr Liikanen from us that he must do his homework !
If the Commission is to be the guardian of the treaties then please , Mr Prodi , be thorough in your work .
They would be happy if this directive was at long last to come into force .
We are not one people .
It should therefore disturb us that fresh fundamental rights conflicts are breaking out in the spheres of information and communication science and biotechnology , but Europe does not have a consensus on fundamental rights with which to provide answers .
I am grateful to you for trusting in me , and although it may not be customary practice , with your permission I would very much like to dedicate my contribution over the last few months to this work , to the
