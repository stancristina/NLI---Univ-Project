are faced with a choice where the issue of democracy is extremely important .
This is another Pillar .
The idea behind the precautionary principle is very simple : provisional safety measures must be taken where scientific information is incomplete and when there are still concerns over safety .
There is no possibility of the Community being party to international agreements where we believe this would jeopardise our citizens ' health , even if this is a highly controversial point .
It is our duty to be cautious , concerned and committed to action .
No food can ever be guaranteed totally safe .
President Prodi , you rightly said that scientific information is always incomplete .
To move on to another matter , we believe - and there have been various surveys in past years which uphold this - that large-scale distributors often 'like ' to coat defrosted meat with toxic substances in order to put it back on the market .
Meat meal was fine for fish , fine for chickens , sheep and pigs .
But we must be aware that , if we look closely at the figures , 0.15 % of 4000 tonnes of feed for cows means 6 tonnes .
These are two matters which have been explained to citizens as extraordinary events , but given the frequency of similar cases in the European Union , in our opinion , we can no longer use stopgap measures but need real solutions instead .
They lose out in the market through no fault of their own and can only look forward to a prolonged period of trying to win back the confidence that they had gained by hard work and production costs which here again , were all too often undervalued or at least , not given their full value .
Therefore , after continuous intake , there certainly will be an accumulation which can be dangerous .
It is an extremely important issue because we must have - let us call it - an agency , which will take these two fundamental principles into account .
We must have a coordinator , but also keep in mind that the whole Commission - and there are various Directorates-General - are still involved .
This is far-reaching and of unprecedented seriousness owing to the way this illness is affecting , in particular , a continent which the European Union has special relations and links with .
But in recent years , I think these have slackened and have completely missed the mark .
With us there to oversee things , we could meet this situation head on and finally agree on measures that are appropriate for an international authority , given that in this regard the WHO is completely incapable of offering specific responses .
It is also harmful for the users who have successfully , and with notable efforts , reached the targets set out in the SAVE 1 programme ( 1991-1995 ) .
I refer here to Amendment 1 to Recital 11 , to new Recital 15a and to Amendment 6 to Article 1 .
This agreement is somewhat bewildering , leaves questions unanswered , and still has grey areas .
European countries have asked for access to South African waters to be regulated , despite the price concessions on South African exports of fish products , against the wishes of that country .
I can see that it does not draw large crowds , but major objectives are never straightforward .
This fact is extremely important .
We have stressed the importance of a good work programme .
Our programme is the one we proposed to you and we will present it in an analytical and comprehensive way .
The aim of the communication is to establish the potential objectives and the possible actions geared to the internal market over the next five years .
Commissioner Verheugen has already been in contact so that the parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs can be immediately informed about the situation .
If we look at that item , then I must say , Mr Bar√≥n Crespo , that it is not only external policy expenditure which must be reallocated , but I would say that we must reallocate all items in the budget .
In terms of power alone , no I do not have this power .
You are perfectly right to ask the question , Mrs Hautala .
I would only remind you that the cultural revolution needs more time .
So this is one of the themes we must talk about in the cultural revolution , and one that we must discuss with the administration .
However , in studying all this , I have realised that there has been no effort to create an administration for the duties the Commission must perform .
The basic philosophy , however , seems to be this : there are some subjects which upset or violate competition and so we must have thorough harmonisation .
( Mr Blokland gave President Prodi the petition ) Well , I do not think there is anything more to say .
Certainly the President is available in all important and necessary cases , otherwise , and quite rightly , the level of debate they say , will drop .
I think that all this will take place in the space of a few hours and so the formal undertaking made by Commissioner Byrne this morning will be put into practice in the next few hours .
It is just difficult to communicate these changes when we ourselves only know that urgent facts have come up a few minutes before the start of the meeting .
So , in these cases , it is likely that mistakes will happen .
In fact , after discussing this with the representatives of various countries , with the people who objected , the consequence was this : we must invest more in training the young and we must put more energy into sending high-level officials to Brussels .
