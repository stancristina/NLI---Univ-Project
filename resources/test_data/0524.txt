Competition between countries to find good solutions to this type of problem normally results in faster progress than central management at higher levels .
Mrs Locatelli should therefore have asked the question : what can EU institutions do for research in Europe that the countries cannot do themselves ?
EU research policy is on the wrong track .     Mr President , this shows us that science and research last in the long run .
The research policy and the report that we are discussing today will help build sustainable economic growth through investment in excellence and technology platforms and will help create the social cohesion that we desire – for example between men and women , from a gender perspective , as well as between different regions .
All day long , we have discussed the Lisbon Process and how we are to become more competitive .
I believe that it must always be the party who requests the information who pays .
I hope and believe that Mr Frattini realises that it is a good idea – even necessary – to ensure that the protection of people’s privacy on a third pillar basis is at least as good as the same protection based on the first pillar .
I share my fellow MEPs’ viewpoint that it would be interesting to hear how you intend to deal with this matter .     – Mr President , as regards the issue of the transfer of passenger data , I would like to add my voice to the questions raised and the criticism made by my fellow MEPs in the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance and the Socialist Group in the European Parliament .
I believe that this draft goes way too far in infringing privacy , for it is based in practice on the concept of surveillance even when no crime is suspected and is actually based on a kind of underlying suspicion of everyone .
This is a key issue concerning our credibility , which the Commission must address .
It is in times of crisis that the rule of law is put to the test , and it is in times of crisis that the rule of law is needed most of all , in order to protect people , partly from unwarranted surveillance by society itself .
Far too often we have discussed these issues – on many occasions without getting answers – only to find that it is then too late .     Mr President , I wish to thank the MEP who honourably declared his interests .
Current sugar policy in the EU has some thousands of winners and 450 million losers .
A weakened reform will lead literally to famine and destitution .
The problem is not that the ‘Everything but Arms ’ initiative exists but that it is not supplemented by social and environmental considerations and by guarantees for small farmers .     The Moderate delegation has voted in favour of the resolution but wishes to emphasise certain problems we see with the wording .
The resolution confuses issues that belong at EU level with those that are quite clearly national issues or , quite simply , matters to be decided by individuals .
The resolution we are voting on today has not been thoroughly prepared .
For many , childlessness is very painful and traumatic .
The reason why , in spite of everything , we choose to vote in favour of the resolution has to do with the situation that gave rise to it , that is to say the exploitation of poor women in Romania , which is something we view seriously , without having a detailed knowledge of all the facts .     Nuclear weapons constitute a serious threat to our global security , and not only in countries such as North Korea and Iran .
The June List’s MEPs support the call to limit the spread of nuclear weapons , something that , in the long term , should lead to a phasing-out of all nuclear weapons .
The resolution contains , however , proposals that would gradually strengthen the role of the EU’s foreign and defence policy , something that would be in danger of weakening the UN’s position .     We welcome the development of a peaceful and democratic Lebanon as an important part of a peaceful and democratic Middle East .
Hezbollah has many parliamentarians and civil activists , and an across-the-board fight against all parts of the organisation will not solve the complex situation involving its status in Lebanon .     We abstained from voting on asking the Commission to defend the proposal that the EU budget should amount to significantly more than one per cent of GDP.
The expansion of nuclear power constitutes one of the most important means of reducing these .
Given that all the amendments to Parliament’s draft resolution tabled by Mr van den Berg and others with this aim in view were defeated , the resolution will not take the issue of the EU’s sugar market down this route .
Today , the European Parliament has voted on a resolution subsequent to an oral question put by Mr Daul and Mr  Fruteau .
Their situation should not , however , be remedied through a less far-reaching reform of the sugar market .
This is partly because the present system costs EU taxpayers a lot of money to maintain and partly because today’s high agricultural subsidies involve EU products being dumped on the world market , something that has serious consequences for the developing countries ’ ability to export and produce .
Finally , it is important for these countries to be given an adequate transitional period in which to adapt to the new situation .     Mr President , I wish to begin by thanking the Commissioner for his answer to the
