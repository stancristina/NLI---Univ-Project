the Banana Panel at the World Trade Organisation , has lost the argument with the Panel on Hormones , the only panel where it really had any chance of winning , has now sought a consensus-based solution when it is still negotiating questions as important as the principle of laws ' extra-territoriality and the same World Trade Organisation body as an instrument to solve this type of conflict .
Mr President , Commissioner , I think that this Council decision is very timely because , if we go down the way that we are going down , I have serious doubts that there can be a common energy policy , perhaps it is very difficult because there are fifteen countries with very different energy systems - and the countries which are going to be incorporated into the Union have different ones again .
I think that is what is missing in the European Union .
We should not forget that this is a geographical area with considerable energy resources , especially natural gas and petroleum , but that it also needs Western technology and business experience .
Madam President , I should like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Myller .
We must bring Europe closer to the citizens and if there is one place where our citizens can see that Europe exists , it is in the border regions .
In conclusion I hope that the Member States have the courage to resolutely pursue this cooperation .
What I would call the 'incrementalist ' approach which consists in the analysis of given programmes or activities , and then , as Mr Baggioni mentioned , an approach which places the accent upon a certain political imperative which is linked to the fundamental geographical reality of the islands .
Island regions have specific needs and the Commissioner , who is a cultivated man , will recall how in Greek literature there are two basic fundamental great works the Iliad telling of the conquest of Troy and the Odyssey describing Ulysses 's efforts to get back home and in practical terms , the tasks facing Ulysses are greater than those required to conquer Troy .
I mentioned earlier the example of the Balearic Islands , currently the richest region in Spain and an island region .
I therefore hope , Madam President , Mr Commissioner , that today 's debate will serve on the one hand to establish the need to consider the subject of the islands in its global perspective and on the other and in a very special way , to stress the effort needed in this final stage of the Intergovernmental Conference , so that the outermost regions of the European Union receive different legal treatment so that they may be regarded as a special case .
The limited amount of space requires great pains to protect the natural environment and makes these regions susceptible to phenomena such as variations in air and sea transport , an interruption in the supply of essential products , provision of drinking water , water treatment and the management and recycling of solid waste .
Whatever may be in the Coca Cola bottle , the mere mark Coca Cola has inestimable economic value .
Along these very lines , again in Madrid in 1995 , a protocol was adopted making it easier for international organizations of a regional nature and with their own system , such as is the case with the European Union , as opposed to signatory States , to accede to the Madrid Agreement .
That is accession of the Council and of the European Community to the Madrid Protocol and subsequently , as a result of this accession to the Madrid Protocol , Community law in force will be amended by a regulation in order to resolve the whole matter .
Mr President , I regret that I have to protest again to the plenary - as I also had to do last time , in Strasbourg - at the burning , in Montpellier , yesterday , of a lorry from Murcia , bound for Russia , with a load of chewing gum .
Mr Patijn , Mr Oreja , as you can see , all of the spokesmen have thanked you for appearing before the European Parliament today and nearly all of us recognize that the Dutch Presidency has worked very well , as did the Irish Presidency before it ; our representatives , Mr Brok and Mrs Guigou , have had good communications with you ; the previous President of the European Parliament , Mr HÃ¤nsch and the present one , Mr Gil-Robles , have made an effort to communicate with and represent the European Parliament at the Intergovernmental Conference , but all of us must show our concern , nonetheless .
At the moment , almost ten years after the fall of the Berlin Wall , I should like to tell you - and this is not a joke - that the European people are now at the wailing wall .
We do not think that there is going to be genuine codecision in areas as important as the budget and legislative processes .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , our group agrees with the basic analysis presented by the Commission on the major thrust of the policies of the Member States and the Community as a whole , which is the subject to which I shall be referring implicitly .
Madam President , not all members of the PSE Group share the views expressed by Mrs Roth-Behrendt , because many of us think that a progressive attitude to so-called 'alternative ' medicines does not mean putting it above any other value of freedom of choice .
That is an ultra-liberal attitude .
The history of medicine , like the history of mankind , is a fight between knowledge and beliefs : the more knowledge advances , the more withdrawn beliefs become
