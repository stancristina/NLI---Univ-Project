Committee but also here in Parliament .
This too would be in line with the Lamfalussy report .
That is why I would invite the Commission to be rather more plucky at this juncture and to make its political priorities clear .
So they have to be labelled .
And now the proposal is to replace the marketing ban for cosmetic products with a ban on animal testing in the EU.
This is what I have done since entering this Parliament , in respect of foodstuffs but also cosmetics .
There are very many experiments underway , and wherever you go - you have the best contacts , Mr Nisticò , but others too - listen to what the scientists are saying ; they do not have enough money .
That is why in exceptional cases , where there is no alternative , we need to allow animal testing until further notice , above all when the optimal protection of infants , children , the sick and older people is at stake , including with respect to shampoos and creams .
In certain product groups , for example , window frames , many firms are already using calcium-zinc compounds as a substitute for this stabiliser today .
Although this is a non-durable PVC product , it is the most suitable because of the product 's properties .
It really is not up to us to repeat industry 's panic-inducing arguments about jobs .
This has been quite perceptible here today .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Green Paper before us has , in my opinion , served its purpose .
The second pillar , the supplementary occupational pension , will certainly play an increasingly important role in the Member States of the European Union .
You have now explained that this is just one step in the process and that others will have to follow so that the directive - and here we are of the same mind - does not perpetuate existing distortions of competition .
If it wanted to do this it would not need a directive at all , because all of the pension funds and financial markets are covered by the OGAF directive .
Even if you leave this to the Member States a contradiction still remains , namely : how can further progress be made and what then is the significance of the directive ?
The committee is therefore calling for sufficient funding for the budget line on statistical information .
The number one topic is , of course , the problem of how , in view of the foot-and-mouth crisis and the BSE situation , we can take budgetary measures - and all of this has an impact on the budget - to achieve sustainable agriculture guaranteeing optimal consumer protection and so that we can also sell European products in other parts of the world .
So we need to make a distinction between politically significant themes , including justice and home affairs policy , in the coming year .
I can accordingly only ask the Council to finally come clean here - to drop their trousers , as we say in German - and adjust the financial perspective , as otherwise we will not be in a position to meet what is required and expected of Europe in budgetary terms in the long run .
In this case I must insist that we cannot simply forget and sweep aside something that we have fought hard for for two years , by which I mean the issue of peace in Europe and , in particular , peace in the Balkans .
How can we deal with immigration that is either unwanted or which we may find desirable at some point in the future ?
We need long-term planning for the administration of the European Parliament .
I believe that the call for the financial perspective to be adjusted is justified .
That is the only way we can translate these objectives into reality .
( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the present crisis in farming - the BSE crisis and the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease - has stimulated public interest in the EU budget .
But , of course , the question that arises is whether we can cope with this rate of increase without having to make decisions about structural savings .
I believe it is fair to say that there is a general consensus within the EU that that would be totally out of the question .
I would like to point out once again that the 2001 budget already includes funding for an action to carry out educational and information work in the countries of origin , in order to tackle the problem at source .
I believe that this is a number that we should keep reminding people about , because the public often imagine that far more people are involved .
However , this new system for budgetary and own resources calculation will not apply until the new own resources decision comes into effect .
However , it is also no secret that on this issue the Council 's approach is just as unwieldy as the rather long title of the regulation whose amendment we are discussing right now .
You now want to scrap the independence of the Financial Controller and make him report to the relevant Director-General as part of the reform programme .
One more comment on the Fléchard case , and let me be clear about this : the Commission cannot in all honesty avoid making a clear admission that the procedure adopted at the time was wrong and that everything must be done to prevent such an unlawful decision ever being made again .
But at the same time , we expect the Commission to refrain from setting up its own new implementing organisation and to draw instead on Member States ' competencies , as they should be playing an active role in this area as well .
