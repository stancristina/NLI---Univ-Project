I would like to point out to Mrs FerreroWaldner , as we tackle this point together , what is in my view the ultimate issue : it is not just a question of law and order - in other words looking at how many monks have been arrested and how many Tibetans have been killed recently due to brutal Chinese repression , hoping that the count will be lower than it was a year ago .
There are two conflicting positions : one of the parties is lying .
This exodus of researchers , year on year , is becoming a definite trend .
However , other important aspects should also count as merits in a researcher 's career : innovation capacity , research management skills , training and supervision skills and collaboration with industry .
Mr President , I voted in favour .
As has been said , it represents a turnover of more than EUR 35 billion and more than 350 000 jobs among sales , distribution and transport .
I will finish , Mr President , by pointing out that in Italy alone , EUR 120 million of cosmetic products , including perfumes and toothpaste , in fact come from the parallel market , with potential serious effects on health . on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , thank you , Mr Verheugen , for coming and giving us the opportunity to discuss this document together .
Following this , the scale of charges and common time periods for examining applications in the different countries should be harmonised , and the authorisation process should be simplified in the case of formulations with minimal differences or variations in colour , for example , thus avoiding extra specific tests requiring further evaluation by each Member State .
It is essential to have complete ownership and a democratic partnership open , therefore , to the public and not confined solely to governments and committees .
It is fantastic to see - Commissioner Michel , whom I know well , is aware of this - that there is great wealth and not just death , destruction and war , although we must , of course , work on those areas to build peace and democracy . rapporteur . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I think it is particularly fitting that Commissioner Michel is taking part in our debate .
This girl is not only physically mutilated , but it is impossible for her to resume a normal relationship with other people ; she feels diminished , different , and in our society we do not want people who are different .
I agree with the rapporteur that tariffs to be charged by the air carriers designated by Nepal for carriage of passengers and goods wholly within the European Union should be subject to European Community law .
I wish to abstain on the report by Mr Hutchinson on MDG contracts .
In fact , although I partially agree with the text tabled , I diverge on several points that I consider important .
In particular , I do not think the exchange of good practices can solve the problem of how to use Structural Funds more effectively or can really contribute to the development of innovative projects .
In view of the sensitive and laborious process of evaluating the active substances used in biocidal products , I agree with the rapporteur about extending the transitional period to four years instead of three in order to give the industry enough time to meet its commitments .
In particular , as a university lecturer , I strongly support the proposal to promote language teaching and exchange programmes in the educational and cultural spheres , such as the well-known youth mobility programmes .
I agree with certain points in the report , but I am decidedly against several other points , and therefore I cannot fully support the tabled text , hence my abstention . on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , firstly I would like to thank those responsible for both reports , which we in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance support .
For example , it would be a serious mistake for the EIB to support large-scale projects such as the bridge over the Straits of Messina or the Brenner base tunnel for high-speed passenger trains .
The key words for European businesses must be cutting-edge research and development .
It is clear that , as the market develops , recourse to mergers or strategic agreements is another possible route , but this must not be at the cost of Europe 's car-making tradition , which is the jewel in the crown of the Community manufacturing industry . on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this debate on the car industry is unfortunately too late in the day and also inadequate in content .
Can we accommodate nationalist measures ?
Vice-President of the Commission . - ( IT ) Madam President , honourable Members , on the eve of the European elections and two weeks away from the adoption of the third maritime package , the European institutions are about to send another positive signal to EU citizens , demonstrating that , at this time of crisis in particular , the Commission , Parliament and the Council are on the side of the citizens , are capable of tackling a difficult crisis and are capable of providing practical answers .
Furthermore , the swift introduction of an air traffic network manager , in addition to facilitating the deployment of national systems , may set an example for all modes of transport , but also for the telecommunication and energy sectors .
