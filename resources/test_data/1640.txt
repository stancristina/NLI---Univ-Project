In particular , is the Commission , despite its role as guardian of the Treaty , afraid to take on Member State governments over Article 296 in order to enforce the fact that many defence items should be subject to the single market ?
Will the Commissioner reassure me that he intends to take the initiative in this area and not run away from it ?
Commissioner , you give a very full response .
I would have liked such a response to the written question which I sent to you .
Your answer simply referred me to the Commission 's opinion on the IGC.
It is not acceptable for a Member of Parliament to take time to write a question and then to get a response from your services which is two lines long .
I can read documents .
I wanted your personal view on Mrs Zabell 's question about legal issues .
We have a tradition with the Treaty of Amsterdam of using protocols to protect specific characteristics .
We could perhaps look at the potential of a protocol to protect the specific characteristic of sport in Europe .
There are many areas now where we have legal challenges , as you rightly know , in the sport domain , particularly in the commercial sector .
We could have a protocol that would allow us to give a political direction to authorities to take proper account of the specific nature and structure of sport in Europe .
Would you be prepared to back such a protocol and do you see a way for us to try and protect the specific nature of sport without , as Mrs Zabell asked , having a particular legal competence ?
Madam President , I extend my thanks to Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca for the way in which he undertook his role as rapporteur and the way in which he involved those of us who were shadows on behalf of our groups .
It was an exemplary way of setting about proceeding on what is a very difficult issue .
Of course with hindsight this is something which should have been considered long ago .
However , the European Commission and the Joint Research Centre have listened to the comments made by the European Parliament about this matter of concern .
I accept that they are trying their very best to put forward a solution which enables them - who know as well as anyone else the seriousness of the situation - to tackle this problem .
The methodology , however , is quite inadequate and can only be very temporary .
We have this historical liability but , colleagues , this is not something that can possibly be funded from current research .
This is not current research .
We would be stealing money from research programmes which are badly needed and a top priority for the European Union if we financed the decommissioning from that budget That would be a completely incorrect use of research funds .
These installations are the property and liability of the whole of the European Community , not uniquely of the research programmes .
Conclusion 9 spells that out most clearly , and I fully support it .
The traditional budgetary procedure is inadequate and inappropriate for the reasons that have been stated by colleagues .
Not least , it is far too uncertain for a very important task like this .
The trialogue is urgently needed .
I support Amendment No 20 which says that the present situation , the present conclusion , is adequate for this year only .
That means that we must have a trialogue meeting called within days after the passing of Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca 's report .
We must ask the chair of our committee , the Commission and the Council to get together before the summer so that a solution can be found for next year 's budget .
This work must be done in the safest possible conditions .
We cannot have any corners cut in an area where it would actually be dangerous to do so .
It must be done properly and properly financed ; no cutting down on the amount of cooling time .
Certainly not !
We face a time-bomb in the Joint Research Centre : the imminent loss of very many skilled people who have the knowledge from their time at the Joint Research Centre .
Those people are getting older and will retire .
We have to have emergency measures to ensure that people with the appropriate skills are brought into the workforce at the Joint Research Centre .
Of course we must look at the historical liabilities , but I urge colleagues to support Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca 's report .
Madam President , I recently visited the JRC at Ispra and it served to remind me firstly of the great amount of good work across the wide range of research activity that is carried out there and , secondly , of the historical legacy from the site 's origins as a nuclear research facility .
In particular , I saw the need to open up stores of waste which were deemed fit some decades ago and met the requirements of the time , but now do not meet our current high standards .
We must bear in mind that times change and the standards change with them .
I note that the procedure proposed by the Commission for the financing of the decommissioning and waste management work on the research reactors has a familiar ring to it .
It sounds rather like the Tomlinson procedure which was adopted for financing Parliament 's building in Brussels .
That was by transferring unexpended funds in odds and ends of budget lines on a year-by-year basis .
So , perhaps colleagues should be cautious before we criticise this proposal .
I recognise the widespread view that funds should not be taken from research lines under the Fifth Framework and that research money should not be used for this purpose .
I see a certain irony in such
