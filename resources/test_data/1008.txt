which he listed what had happened over the course of January .
We can invest in better and more diversified means of providing ourselves with energy .
Have we made mistakes ?
The Cubans are not free to travel abroad , not even to receive a prize that has been awarded to them .
It was Louis Michel who , not so long ago , following a congenial four-day visit to Havana , advised the European Council , in strong terms , not to consider imposing any diplomatic sanctions .
Mr Solana , the Commission and the Council must enter into dialogue with it .
That is to be welcomed .
I assume that the Council is familiar with the Böge resolution on the financial perspectives .
Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Toubon for his commitment and the way he went about things , but also , and all , to express my gratitude to the Commission and Commissioner Verheugen for the proposal they have made for the drafting of better legislation and deregulation .
Similarly , it would be unfortunate , in my view , if we were to travel to other countries in Europe , as tourists or otherwise , and if we would no longer be able to enjoy the weights and measures that apply there , like , for example , the pint in the United Kingdom .
We need to explain to the people what we are doing and why it matters to them .
The responsibility in dealing with those problems lies with us all – all the institutions – and not only with the press room downstairs .
Here was a case of the Commission not even listening to its own Parliament , never mind the people .
This turns the differences between national regulations into a nuisance factor in the competitive struggle .
Better legislation could have already been in place and will need to be put on the agenda once again in the near future .
His commitment and involvement were phenomenal and I should like to thank him for that .
The direct link with working times inspection has been removed .
We have also gained a definitive date for the introduction of the digital tachograph .
It contains a readily workable break regulation – 11 hours instead of 12 hours of rest – and allows drivers to decide for themselves where to sleep rather than having Parliament deciding the matter for them .
Overall , I think the proposal is acceptable , even though it does contain elements about which I am unhappy .
I would ask you again to ensure we have a normal debate with a normal ending before we start the voting procedure .     Mr President , quite simply , in the second sentence we propose that ‘strategy ’ be replaced by ‘policies’ .     .
New legislation , however , appears to reflect a trend towards new restrictions .
I would ask the Members and other groups to support this proposal .     .
Too many animals sustain injuries on legs and chest due to poor litter .
The directive also provides for professional and daily health and welfare checks , which , particularly in this day and age , are an important preventive measure against animal diseases .
It makes no sense whatsoever to increase the severity of penalties or increase their duration for longer than is strictly necessary .
In Article 20 of this Agreement , import restrictions to protect human , animal or plant life or health are said to be justified on moral grounds .
The Commission fails to take this into account in any way , and as the previous speaker said , we have not yet seen an economic analysis .
Madam President , although all things considered , Mr Berman’s report strikes a good balance between the importance of animal welfare and the interests of the agricultural sector , I would like to argue that the interests of chickens should count for more where stocking densities are concerned .
One could say that we do not make that mistake in the World Trade Organisation and that although Europe tries its hardest , more should be done .
As long as there are no guarantees , though , that imports can be subjected to the same criteria , as long as we are once again putting the European farmer on the back foot and are again making things more difficult for animal welfare in Europe , it will be extremely difficult for us to vote in favour of this report .     .
It disrupts the market and distorts competition .
I should like to repeat – and I am increasingly feeling like a voice in the wilderness in this respect – that the phrases ‘services of general interest ’ and ‘services of general economic interest ’ have still not been defined , and it is , in that light , very odd to legislate for them .
State aid should not only be seen as a deviation or aberration from perfect market forces , but as an instrument for achieving socio-economic objectives .
Given the interests of town and country planning , the integration of minorities and social integration in cities , certain players within the market may well be granted government support in order to achieve those broader objectives .
I would urge you to keep up the good work , for much remains to be done .     Mr President , I should like to make three observations with regard to the human rights clause .
If anything , Europe should be able to give more account of what happens with taxpayers ’ money .     .
We only have to look at the German example , where between 1998 and 2002 , employment in the energy sector doubled to approximately 125 000 jobs as a consequence .
