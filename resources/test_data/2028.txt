This proposal suggests that , on emotive subjects , the Commission is prepared to act on the basis of that emotion , without the kind of sensible assessment of risk that we need here , as we do for example on risks in foodstuffs .
There has to be , even with the precautionary principle , a substantial link between the assessment of risk and action by the European Union .
If not , then surely we do not even need a European Food Agency : we can just legislate on the basis of the precautionary principle .
It is the Commission 's task to assess that risk .
In this case I am not satisfied , as Mr Bowis has said , that the Commission really heeded the advice of its own advisers .
When the chairman of the scientific committee came to us he most certainly did not convey to us any sense of the urgent need for action .
The conclusion I draw from this is that in future , to avoid this kind of emotive reaction on an emotive subject , we should have a European Union chemicals agency , which will not be the creature of the Commission , to assess risks .
I am concerned that the science behind this proposal is incomplete .
Yes , eight Member States have banned phthalates , but when the Commissioner replies , can he tell us whether those eight Member States have supplied the Commission with the scientific evidence that they based their ban on ?
We also lack the evidence on migration limits , and that has been mentioned .
That might have enabled the Commission to bring forward a proposal we could all agree with .
What we therefore have is a thoroughly unsatisfactory proposal .
Six phthalates are identified , and a system of warnings proposed that makes no sense .
The Environment Committee has taken the logical step that the Commission avoided .
If these are dangerous , then they should all be banned and warnings would then be unnecessary .
The only problem with this is that the action is then quite disproportionate to the risk , and sets a thoroughly bad precedent for future European Union action in relation to the chemicals we use .
Mr President , this report requesting banning the use of phthalates in some soft PVC children 's toys is flawed in many ways and rests on a dubious legal basis , given that the Chairman of the Scientific Committee for Toxicity , Eco-toxicity and the Environment , Professor Bridges , when he appeared before this Parliament 's Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy on 23 May , stated : " It is hard to see how it " - the ban - " would come under a scientific interpretation of serious and immediate risk " , which is the required criterion for the ban imposed in December .
The Commission seems to have ignored its own scientific committee on the basis that some Member States are imposing their own ban .
They are entirely within their rights , of course .
Instead I support the development of tests to determine migration limits , and for these to be legislated on in due course , rather than a long-term ban as proposed .
It is particularly galling that , of the six named phthalates to be banned , five are not even used for children 's toys and only two are suspected on the basis of unreplicated tests on rats .
I too am concerned for the welfare of small children , but based on reasoning and science , not on emotions .
This whole business contrasts markedly with my request for restrictions to be placed on the use of mobile phones by young children , in a formal question to the Commission under the same precautionary principle .
This was , of course , refused even though it admitted there was no research evidence on the safety of child use of mobiles and there was some data for adult brain damage in the prolonged use of mobile telephones .
A recent UK government report has recommended restrictions to child use of mobiles as a developing brain is more sensitive to electromagnetic radiation .
We have to face the fact that here in the West brain tumours have risen dramatically by some 100 % over the last ten years for totally unknown reasons .
Therefore I call again on the Commission to use the precautionary principle consistently or admit that the whole thing is a politically motivated exercise with powerful commercial interests at play , undermining the precautionary principle and risking turning it into a farce .
Mr President , so much has gone wrong on the phthalates issue that it is difficult to know where to start .
The Commission 's temporary bans have no legal basis .
The Commission may introduce an emergency ban where there is a clear and immediate danger , but no such danger exists with phthalates .
These materials have been in widespread use around the world for forty years , yet there is no evidence of any kind that any damage has ever been done to anyone .
There was one test on rats in which massive quantities of phthalates appeared to cause problems , but researchers have been unable to replicate this test .
We are dealing here with little more than media hysteria and ignorance .
More people have died in Teddy Kennedy 's car than have died of phthalates !
Compare and contrast our position on phthalates with our position on tobacco .
Phthalates have never done any harm to anyone , yet we are banning them .
Tobacco , we are told , kills half a million people each year in the European Union but do we ban it ?
No, we do
