I therefore feel it is vitally important for Parliament to examine what initiatives the Commission has taken with a view to implementing the following measures : making Community aid conditional on long-term agreements on employment and local development , as Parliament has proposed ; setting up a register of companies relocating and benefiting directly or indirectly from public incentives , thereby failing to meet their contractual obligations ; refusal to grant or requirement to return Community funding for companies that fail to meet their contractual obligations in full – I wonder how many times this has been implemented ; practical measures adopted by the Commission to support the workers and to foster the economic recovery of the regions affected by relocations ; and the drafting of a Code of Conduct to prevent company relocations .     . – Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the process leading to the adoption of the new regulation on the European Social Fund is worthy of Parliament’s support .
I have always opposed the Commission ’s original proposal and suggested a more flexible yet tighter alternative solution that would earmark a suitable amount of resources from the European Social Fund for measures to strengthen the capacities of the social partners , albeit specifying that these activities must relate to training , network integration measures and stepping up social dialogue .
I was very gratified to see that the Council agreed with our proposals .
Lastly , I should like to express my gratitude for the excellent spirit of cooperation shown throughout the process and to Mr Špidla , who is in the Chamber today .
Therein also lies the reason why , for example , the so-called statistical effect regions , such as the Algarve region of Portugal have not been completely compensated , something that we consider unacceptable .
It is estimated that some 700 000 people around the world fall victim to this crime every year .
It also offers victims legal and material assistance , and provides for their physical and psychological recovery .     .
It is up to the Member States to define their priorities and the areas to be funded ; in other words , there is some leeway for the Member States to implement it correctly .
Most importantly , special transitional – and more beneficial – arrangements have been laid down during the phasing-in stage of the new Regional Competitiveness and Employment objective for the autonomous region of Madeira .
The N+2 rule has been kept and there is no guarantee , at least on the Council’s part , that the money from the Structural Funds that has been cut and not implemented will continue to be used solely in this area .
This is tantamount to blackmail , which is unacceptable .
These reductions will be paid for by the other Member States including cohesion countries , which will be penalised twice over .
The current method of funding the Community budget has become obsolete , and in recent years the shortcomings have come to the fore .
As Mr Lamassoure said in his report , I am in favour of a Community budget funding system that is transparent , fair and equitable , one that provides the EU with a financial framework that matches its current priorities and its legitimate ambitions .
We are opposed to this trend , as expressed in the resolution before us , of which the euro is an instrument and the objectives of which are laid down in the financial services action plan .
I also welcome the inclusion in this proposal of internal flights and flights starting or finishing in the EU , and the creation of a single European airspace , which will make it possible to cut down on air routes .
Another important proposal in the report is the inclusion of internal flights and all flights that start or finish in the EU , with a view to preventing market imbalances .
The first remark one is led to make is that this new era has helped to reduce poverty around the world .
If such guidelines are to prevail externally , the biggest concern internally will have to be the focus on increased competitiveness .
I therefore believe that there needs to be intervention at European level in the definition and execution of public policies that promote regional and social cohesion , with a view to preventing the phenomenon of exclusion .
That would not be the right path to follow ; rather it would be something of a false dawn that would feed meaningless illusions .
I believe that it is not Parliament’s job to make judgments on individual cases , which seems to have been at the root of this debate .
Much more attention needs to be paid to industrial mergers and restructuring .
General Motors must keep its side of the bargain and the Commission must take the measures needed to ensure that Opel Portugal functions as normal and that employment with rights is guaranteed .     – General Motors is making thousands of European workers redundant .
This is why this debate is worthwhile .
Thousands of workers , some of whom are here in the Chamber today , are under threat of redundancy .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , strategic changes and business restructuring must take into account the fact that workers are human beings and not just factors of production .
Commissioner , the Globalisation Adjustment Fund , adopted at the December European Council , has neither the remit nor the capacity to prevent all of the situations that have arisen in Europe .
Importance must be attached to the most vulnerable industrial sectors and to the consequences of the liberalisation of world trade , which are already being felt .
There is no point in negotiating only with Russia on the issue
