cross-border projects .
It has done an outstanding job and I welcome the positive response in the report to it .
There is also the Special Peace Programme from the European Union itself .
At grass-roots level in Northern Ireland it too is bringing together people from both sections of our community , in particular with projects for young people - young men and women .
There are shared-city initiatives to promote community ; there is development and training for unemployed women - I am just singling out some of the very successful operations that are going on - the development of the food industry and , of course , the new housing development .
We very much welcome and deeply thank the Commission for this , and the Council of Ministers for the Special Peace Programme for Northern Ireland .
I should like to express my deep gratitude to all my colleagues in this Parliament for their unanimous support for this peace project because it is making such a very positive contribution to the development of peace in my country .
Mr President , as a Member of Parliament representing that part of Ireland which benefits from both the IFI and the Peace and Reconciliation Fund , I would like to praise the track record of both these funds , and as a representative who works closely with the local groups and projects making excellent use of the funds I would like to state that I am perfectly satisfied that all monies disbursed through the funds are rigorously accounted for .
The IFI and the Peace Fund are unique funds so it is understandable that certain misunderstandings should have arisen owing to a lack of familiarity with the special nature and operation of these funds .
As was pointed out previously , the EU makes a major contribution together with the United States , Canada , Australia and New Zealand .
The Fund has committed in excess of £400 million which has triggered an investment of £1.2 billion creating 38 000 jobs for 150 projects right across the border countries and Northern Ireland .
I deem it wholly inappropriate that the Committee on Budgetary Control should question the effectiveness of the IFI funding system .
I believe that these funds have made a major contribution towards the peace process and that Mr Dell'Alba should familiarise himself a little more in detail with these funds .
I would invite him to visit Northern Ireland and the border countries and to see the situation for himself .
Mr President , I would firstly like to acknowledge the work that the Court of Auditors did in producing the report that my report is based on which contained lots of detailed work .
I would also like to thank the services of our committee which helped me a very great deal and indeed the ECB itself which kindly entertained me in Frankfurt for a day and told me where my report was going wrong .
There is a tiny bit of history behind this report .
On 31 May 1998 the European Monetary Institute changed to the European Central Bank .
The president was still the same person and 402 of the 407 staff that were working in the EMI changed also to the ECB.
The ECB took on all the assets and liabilities of the EMI .
The Court of Auditors ' report identified a number of problem areas which I will come to shortly .
The European Central Bank replied to the report , but its replies were certainly short , I would say 'terse ' , and the Court of Auditors found them quite inadequate since they did not give any indications of actions that the ECB intended to take to remedy the shortcomings exposed by the Court of Auditors ' report .
There were two main areas where the Court of Auditors identified problems .
There are equally two areas in which Parliament , and in particular the Committee on Budgetary Control , took a great interest .
The Committee was obviously interested in the Bank 's relationship with OLAF , and this is summarised in my report 's Conclusion 4 which , if will allow me , I will read .
This states : " Welcomes the public commitment of the European Central Bank , in its annual report for 1999 , to establish a cooperative relationship with the European Anti-Fraud Office OLAF but regrets clear incompatibility between the public commitment assumed by the ECB in its 1999 annual report to establish close cooperation with OLAF and the decision by the ECB itself to prevent OLAF from carrying over internal investigations , pending the ruling by the European Court of Justice . "
That is a court case that is ongoing .
The other part that the Committee was very interested in was the contradictory procedure .
It took ages in this particular case , and when I asked both institutions why , they both said that they had replied in the time that they were given and quite within the guidelines .
So , I can only blame the postal services of Frankfurt and Luxembourg , and I guess they need greater liberalisation .
However , I am sure these problems will not occur in future .
The main areas specified as problems in the Court of Auditors ' report concerned the ECB 's project management and monitoring .
The Court of Auditors ' report noted a lack of any commitments accounting system which had caused great concern ; that it was difficult to track project development simply and coherently ; and that the ECB had engaged a company of consultants to run some foreign currency reserve subledger projects in July 1998 , but by the end of the year the ECB had still not designated a full-time manager for this project , although that was essential for the monitoring of the consultants ' work
