to be limited , since this clearly was in the public interest .
How can this information not have been requested ?
These are all documents that are vital for learning about the decision-making process .
This means that there is widespread illegality , which cannot be tolerated as it generates a strong distortion of competition between companies and territories and makes work and workers less secure .
Nonetheless , I have to say that together we have tried to rationalise the Council 's initial proposal as far as possible , adding elements of legal certainty .
The limit is that already established by public policy and the non-applicability in a given state of any law providing for a type of marriage not considered to exist in that state .
The undue precedence of security over freedom has often resulted in the removal of safeguards of our rights . draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs De Sarnez , who has put together an excellent summary report despite circumstances in which the Commission , and above all the Council , have not always shown themselves to be open to appeals from this Parliament .
My report contained suggestions that were taken on board by the rapporteur .
However , I would like to appeal to the Commission : let us not repeat the mistakes of the past .
From as early as the age of 9 or 10 , children are going online several times a week , and 75 % of 12- to 15-year-olds in Europe use the Internet for roughly three hours a day , communicating through chat services , messaging and social networking sites .
The child is led on by the affectionate and confidential behaviour ; not understanding the danger , they enjoy the exclusive relationship that develops , and so do not discuss it with anyone , least of all with their parents .
I would like to conclude , Mr President , by emphasising that our obligation , both Parliament 's and - I am convinced of this - the Commission 's obligation , is never to let down our guard on these matters .
Parliament wants to remain at the forefront in this area .
No matter how much one quibbles over interpretation , this principle is based on a single truth : there should be no difference in treatment between workers , in terms of the country in which the services are provided , whether they are posted or mobile workers , and whatever their nationality .
This crisis is undoubtedly systemic , but to combat a systemic crisis we need to devise a new system and - with all due respect to yourself , President Sarkozy - re-found global capitalism .
At last we have common rules in an area that affects us all and which should see us particularly united .
I have voted in favour of Mr Wijkman 's report on building a Global Climate Change Alliance between the European Union , the Least Developed Countries ( LDCs ) and Small Island Developing States ( SIDS ) ; I believe that we cannot postpone taking tougher action outside of the EU in respect of the joint challenges of climate change and the reduction of poverty .
Firstly , the situation of the Degar minority , who are Christians in Vietnam 's central highlands : they are still being arrested in their hundreds and there is still no free access to the central highlands of Vietnam for international observers , particularly for the United Nations .
First of all , I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr JÃ¸rgensen , and the shadow rapporteurs , for their commitment and constructive input , as well as the close collaboration that has taken place in the interinstitutional discussions throughout the summer .
The directive will incorporate general parameters for energy consumption , emissions of CO2 and emissions of other pollutants into procurement through competitive tendering .
It can be anticipated that , thanks to this directive , in the long term clean , energy efficient vehicles will come in greater numbers onto the market and there will be a reduction in their costs through economies of scale .
In other areas , it would also strictly mean a monetisation of health , or a monetary evaluation of health .
I would like to thank all the other Members who participated in the debate , which was by no means dull , but a lively one , with sound observations , as well as some controversy , which is always good to hear .
Thus , a few weeks ago we also announced which objects can be carried as hand baggage and which objects cannot .
The objective of the action being taken by the Commission and the Transport and Energy Directorate-General is to move in a direction that is helpful to citizens : always to protect citizens ' rights under all circumstances is a commitment that I have made before this very Parliament , and which I intend to continue to honour .
With regard to the procedure , in line with the comitology procedure with scrutiny , on 4 September I informed the chairman of the relevant parliamentary committee , which is the Committee on Transport and Tourism .
This meeting , which may also be repeated , is to establish whether there are any health risks , which is the issue that most concerns me .
Thus it would be immediately deleted and absolutely not recorded - recording would be made impossible .
In other words , every guarantee must be given to ensure that this does not become an invasive tool , since it ought to be merely a tool intended to make things easier for citizens and to provide them with greater assurances
