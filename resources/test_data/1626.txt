The report represents a compromise achieved through cooperation by all groups and one that has been adopted with overwhelming support by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
All those who want to operate on the market – not just the organic holdings , which are legally required to be GM-free , but also large sections of conventional agriculture – see this as part of their market .
We were successful , and I congratulate Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , whose own-initiative report on the subject sends another important political signal from this House .
Another important feature in our report is the call for the Commission to submit a proposal for Community-wide liability and insurance .
It is bad enough to have to face being diagnosed with an illness as serious as this one , but it is even worse to realise that , although there is help to which you are entitled , you cannot access it , or that an employer is not prepared to take reasonable steps to enable you to carry on an active working life .
We may note , in conclusion , that the report calls on individual states and the European level to raise awareness of multiple sclerosis .
We use them ; we have a single drivers ’ licence and a single set of road traffic regulations .
The key role played by legal and regulatory frameworks that promote competition and enable a better range of services to be provided to all citizens was recognised .
We have international logistics companies that transport goods around the world .
We must not forget that the Summit in Geneva nearly collapsed .
I hope that next year , we can address this topic again , and that this House will adopt a resolution on the matter before Tunis .     Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it is extremely positive and gratifying that the Commission – as my fellow Members have already recognised in today’s debate – contributed to the World Summit on the Information Society and that it will continue to make a major contribution on this issue .
For the first time at one of the major UN conferences , civil society groups were included as partners , and this proved very beneficial .
In these negotiations , the Council was a little less willing to compromise than in the other negotiations .
If the PPE-DE Group does not accept this on principle , it should vote against it , but it should not use technical arguments as a pretext .     .
I would like to thank the European Parliament for making it possible for our special delegation to travel to the elections .
We must ensure that after many decades of foreign tutelage , the country has the opportunity at last to become what it once was in history , namely a genuinely independent and peaceful factor in a very important and very dangerous region .
No state has the right – other than in self-defence – to challenge any individual’s right to life .
As the EU , we must make our contribution to ensuring , for example , that an OSCE mandate , which has been discussed here , can be achieved .
We affirm that European integration is a labour of peace , of understanding and of reconciliation , from which nobody in Europe or anywhere in the world will succeed in diverting us .
We absolutely must do something about this .
I really would like to thank you for that .
Although I mention this only in passing , that too is not something that should be ruled out .
What can be said , in general terms , about the storage of radioactive waste is that the mere fact that there is no sure solution to how to dispose of nuclear waste shows how irresponsible it is to build new nuclear power stations .
My report , moreover , calls on the Council to consult Parliament in the event of any substantial amendment to the Commission proposal , especially in view of the fact that the Commission ’s proposals are combined in a single document .
The Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy has made it abundantly clear that , of the European Union’s fifteen Member States , six have never taken up the production of nuclear energy , and six have decided to abandon it , which leaves just three Member States .
Perhaps we should give some thought to that when we talk about a European energy strategy .
Not the least reason why we have been debating this for so long is we have hitherto had only lists of issues , but no solutions .
The fact is that this also plays a part in democratic politics , as the public , if they are dissatisfied with the services , can respond accordingly by voting certain towns ’ governments out of office and other parties into it .
It is particularly with France in mind that much lost ground has to be made up , and you , Commissioner Lamy , should resolve these problems before tackling any new projects .     – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , not for the first time , but yet again , the debate on the Green Paper shows that services of general interest , the way in which they are provided and structured , are more than ever in the spotlight , not only in terms of political debate but also of the European public’s concerns about universal access to services .
It follows that it is not worth working towards a uniform and all-embracing European definition , but there are a number of standards and a few criteria that of course amount to the same thing and that also have to be embedded in it .
We understand a European
