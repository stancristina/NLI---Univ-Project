You are from an island , as I am ; this measure , although it would not affect countries which only have a continental structure , would have a very negative impact on the island regions and , above all , on those which are a very long way from the central nucleus of the European Union .
It is an issue that has very serious repercussions at many levels and the consequences of mass uncontrolled sales may therefore be disastrous .
Furthermore , of the main importers , we must stress that China and India are two of the countries that receive and buy the greatest quantities of these types of products .
The report also mentions aspects that relate to arms brokering , the regulation of torture equipment , the impact of enlargement and also the role to be played by the European Union in relation to the United Nations .
I believe that the issue of weapons of mass destruction genuinely deserves special attention , particularly in view of something that has already been said : if we want to have credibility on the international stage , particularly in this field , the European Union must begin to offer an example .
I would therefore ask that effective action be taken against that Member , so that there may be no further incidents such as that one .
Arms are dangerous .
I believe that this is something that should be provided for in the future , in order to ensure that the Council is here to listen to Parliament’s views in relation to this kind of report .     – Mr President , perhaps we had naively believed that the REACH vote was going to end at 11.30 or 12.00 and that this morning we would be able to hold a debate and a vote on two such important issues as European development policy and the European Union’s development strategy for Africa .
It received widespread support and our vote in the Committee on Development .
This is a field that directly affects millions of Europeans , many of them committed and public-spirited young people ; the kind of citizens whom we should try to win over to the project of European integration .
Following the earthquake that occurred in October , which caused the deaths of between 70 000 and 90 000 people and made seven million people homeless , we must respond in an immediate , urgent fashion .
Despite that , last July , the Philippines Supreme Court confirmed the death sentence .
A presidential pardon would demonstrate a commitment to democracy and human rights , which would enhance the international credibility of the Philippines .
He was not allowed a proper defence at the trial .
We must therefore support the political groups of Philippine members of parliament who are going to present a draft abolishing the death penalty in that country ’s congress , so that that abolition can become a reality and the death penalty in the Philippines can come to an end .
We in this House rarely have the opportunity to analyse and deal with the situation in the Philippines .
I say this out of respect for Mrs Martens as rapporteur and , of course , out of respect for the importance of the issue .
As Commissioner Mandelson has told us , Hong Kong will be difficult but not impossible , and it must therefore be approached with a combination of realism and ambition .
In the case of the NAMA , negotiations are at a standstill and are always dependent on results in other areas .
Like bicycles , the WTO topples if we stop pedalling and we cyclists fall with the bicycle .
Go to it , Commissioner : the other negotiators will have to make a move sooner or later .
In Laos , as the Council and the Commission have said quite rightly , there are still prisoners of conscience and the entire hmong population is still being persecuted in the forests in an entirely sub-human situation .
In Laos , the humanitarian situation is becoming increasingly serious and it does not just affect the hmong population , but also many other ethnic and national communities ; and what is more , local authorities are denying humanitarian organisations access .
Too often it is only those of us on the outside who know what is happening and how to solve it ; sometimes it is also necessary for those on the inside to have access to that information .     Madam President , as has already been said , the tradition of the Olympic truce was established in Ancient Greece in the ninth century BC .
We have not been free to carry out our work as a delegation charged with investigating the complaints from thousands of citizens against work being funded by the European Union .
A reduced VAT rate that also brings to the surface resources which were previously submerged , and which can be used to fund future pensions .
Their only crime has been courageously and peacefully to defend the rights of their relatives and I therefore believe , Mr President , that we , as representatives of the European Parliament , should make every effort to ensure that they can be here and collect the Sakharov Prize on Wednesday .     Mr President , on my own behalf and on behalf of Mrs Madeira and Mr Pittella , I would call upon Mr Blair , represented on the Council’s bench , to put right the insult to our intelligence and to European democratic values of the discrimination in his financial proposal against the regions of the Algarve , Basilicata , Asturias , Murcia , Ceuta and Melilla compared to three German , three Greek regions and an Austrian region , which are suffering the same statistical effect , but which are being given better
