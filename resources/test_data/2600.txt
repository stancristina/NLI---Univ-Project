Mobility and passenger safety are a necessary condition if our goals of growth , cohesion and convergence are to be met through the tourist industry as well .
Tourism is a fundamental activity for my country , Italy , and especially so for my city , Rome .
This report offers a number of ideas around which intelligent proposals can be drawn up : tourist destinations of excellence , cutting VAT rates for operators , and promoting agrotourism , a very Italian form of rural tourism to encourage farmers not to leave the countryside and to promote traditional produce .
For that reason as well , we in the Union for Europe of the Nations Group fully support the call for the Commission and the Council , when adopting the structural policy instruments for 2007-2013 , to provide for an integrated approach to tourism , ‘allowing the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Regional Development Fund actions to be coordinated’ .
Turning to the Commissioner , I think it is appropriate to point out that this ambitious report , which combines a gender approach with health and the state of our health systems , deserves to be placed in the political spotlight , including by the Commission .
We do not need obscurantist attitudes !
Another kind of illegal activity is property speculation , which has involved – and generally spoilt – areas of environmental value and cultural heritage , with the tacit agreement and often even the approval of run-down local authorities .
Because European Schools provide a public service , such unilateral decisions violating families ’ established rights should not be allowed .
Ladies and gentlemen , what is lacking in this Parliament’s resolutions – including cross-party resolutions like this one – is a little intellectual honesty .
Paragraph 3 , which asks that it should be made clear to the Chinese authorities that a genuine partnership can only develop when shared values are fully respected and put into practice , ends up being hypocritical .
For us Europeans , language is synonymous with culture and history and hence with a vast historical and cultural heritage .
I believe that the directive is really important , because the problem of market security exists , as the scandals that have come to light have highlighted even more .
I have to be frank and say that it is a compromise that certainly does not rise to great heights of ambition .
Shifting the procedure from unanimity to qualified majority and from Parliament merely giving its opinion to codecision will allow us to achieve something that for me , perhaps , and I think for many others , is even more important : achieving a common European asylum system by 2010 , involving not just the procedures any more , but the substance , the difference in concrete terms between European action and action just by the Member States .
As you well know , the case law of the Court of Justice is often highly advanced in its interpretation .
I think that the Kreissl-Dörfler report improves the directive put before us , particularly in that it deletes the part about super-safe countries and increases the margin for appeal against any refusal .
To us this is an extremely important point : by definition , a safe third country obviates case-by-case assessment , in that we delegate our responsibility to another country that is considered safe according to rather flexible criteria .
The harmonisation that we have produced is probably such that it even makes some national legislations worse .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I should like to compliment the Council on its absence .
Some amendments that go against the Council proposals have been adopted .
Thousands of migrants leave Lampedusa to be expelled and sent to Libya , which is anything but a safe country , Mrs Klamt ; and when people are sent from the United Kingdom to Iraq , they are going to a country that is anything but a safe third country .
I believe that the European Union should acknowledge and uphold this basic right for anyone who is truly fleeing persecution or war , but I mean truly fleeing .
That , too , is a serious violation , when someone in one Member State is in the same situation as someone else in another Member State but is treated differently .
Therefore , why should we not also explore the possibility of the Council and Parliament working together on a subject that is clearly sensitive , as Mr Coelho said as well ?
It is indeed true that the US Administration will put a bill before Congress to change the status and limit the use of 17 European names currently considered semi-generic in the United States , but it is also true that the United States will still be able to use 14 Community traditional names , although subject to certain conditions and for a limited period of time .
Mr President , the agreement includes the commitment that negotiations for an even more thorough agreement will start 90 days after it enters into force .
In this regard , we ask that the talks focus on the effective protection of traditional names .
How can we now ask our producers to comply with Community rules and the Community’s quality policy if we then give third countries the chance to export to our market products that the Community itself forbids its own producers to make ?
In a word , it means ensuring that the geographical indications for our wines are respected and that our production in this sector thereby remains competitive .
I should like to add some information for my fellow Members .
Instead , measures must be adopted that are widespread , harmonious and thorough in less-developed areas , as Mr Guellec has rightly shown .
The wider neighbourhood action plan is a good opportunity both to establish economic , social and
