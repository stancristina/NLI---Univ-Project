parties in the Member States wish to enter upon a new course .
The Bullmann report is aimed at retaining a policy of synthesis and compromise .
We are also concerned that , in preparing for the Barcelona Summit , the Commission , the Council and Parliament have done so little to take account of the candidate countries ' needs and interests .
We are basically well-disposed towards the European Union .
Every political decision should be made as close to those affected by the decision as is possible and appropriate .
The EU should only have limited competence within these areas .
Moreover , there are major differences between national and local opinions on what may be considered the best policy .
Closely linked to social and employment policy is , of course , the tax burden .
We wholeheartedly support many of the ideas - though far from all of them - presented in Mr Bullmann' s report , but at national or local level .
If , instead , the EU starts making the decisions on tax , then the national parliaments and the Member States will be deprived of one of their most basic areas of competence .
The EU will then become not only a project of cooperation but also a State - without , however , consisting of a common people , which is the necessary emotional basis and prerequisite for long-term cohesion .
Particularly in view of the worryingly few pronouncements made by the Spanish Presidency on the environmental dimension , for example prior to the annual assessment of sustainable economic development and social cohesion , I regret the fact that the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy has not produced an opinion on the report and that the views expressed by the Committee at the Barcelona Summit have therefore been framed in the form of a separate resolution .
I have voted in favour of the report .
It is extremely positive that the fifth part of Amendment No 27 , which emphasises that it is research on adult stem cells that is to be given priority within biotechnology , has been adopted .
All the major Christian churches , especially the Roman Catholic Church in its ethical teaching , reject methods that use fertilised embryos - future persons with all their genetic make-up - for research purposes .
Against that background , I believe that the Community ' s structural funds should instead support alternatives such as sustainable planning for water treatment in towns , the modernisation of irrigation methods , the integrated treatment of ground and surface water etc .
The project is in danger of affecting areas bordering on the delta of the River Ebros , which are very valuable in terms of their bio-diversity in general and bird life in particular .

The result of the vote was 391 against , 96 in favour and 15 abstentions .
Only in that way can Turkey as a country and the Turks as a people avoid being haunted by their own history .
Report Lucas ( A5-0014/2002 )
It is the lack of balance that surprises us .
As a Scandinavian citizen , I am also very disappointed at the fact that the Commission never refers to the supplementary clause , incorporated into Directive 95/46/EC on Sweden 's initiative and stating that account must always be taken of the public when processing personal data .
The reason was as follows : ( the speaker continued in French ) There is a Regulation No 45/2001 relating to the protection of personal data .
Mr President , I welcome the fact that the EU is on the way to introducing its own data protection supervision .
The amount of such information will expand further , especially when Schengen has been fully integrated into Community legislation .
The rights balance each other out .
The right of access to documentation and to information , together with the defence of fundamental rights are both legitimate .
That is the purpose of the work of reform in our Parliament .
In a majority of cases , Parliament has criticised the procedures .
Parliament 's role in preparing the programme has been unsatisfactory , in spite of the fact that the framework agreement states clearly and unambiguously that the Commission must take the maximum account of the guidelines proposed by Parliament .
As the Commission takes more and more legislative initiatives , it may be difficult for Parliament to keep up , and we shall sometimes be blamed for legislation 's being delayed .
The agreement involves quite a long process involving staging posts , regular dialogue and checkpoints , as well as close cooperation and partnership .
By involving the committees at such an early stage , we shall be better prepared when the legislative proposal is , in fact , submitted , and the work can then proceed smoothly and easily .
All this is to be found in the appendix to the proposal we are to vote on tomorrow .
The annual legislative programme is to be presented with reference to a calendar , to the legal base and to any budgetary implications .
We cannot draw up long lists , but we must show that we know how to prioritise .
The database should also contain information about the calendar , budgetary implications and legal base .
By changing the procedures in this way , I believe we can obtain a method of working and a legislative cycle which are more effective , more transparent and more comprehensible .
I should genuinely like also to thank the other political groups for cooperating with us in reaching this final result .
Of course , we hope that , in the long term , this will lead to simplification and increased clarity , although this year we will be working with the old and the new methods in parallel
