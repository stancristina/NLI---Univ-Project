you that , during the course of discussions in the Constitutional Convention , a huge effort was made to integrate a legal basis into the new Treaty which would give the European Union the possibility to legislate on questions of violence overall , be it against women , children or the elderly .
The Commission 's intention is to fund the Daphne programme as much as it can .     .
However , I wanted to ask you to clarify the last part of my question : do you share the opinions expressed by the United States on relations with Syria and its role in the region and in achieving peace .
The methodology followed by the European Union is different from that followed by the United States .
Do these fears have any bearing on the policy of the European Union ?     .
Of course , Commissioner , as you said , women make a very great contribution , even in countries in which their fundamental freedoms and human rights are not recognised .
The number of women infected with the AIDS virus is high and is rising constantly .
I should also like to welcome the agreement by the members of the WTO in August 2003 , despite the differences and time-consuming procedures and delays which intervened , the efforts of the UN to provide high quality drugs to patients with the AIDS virus and the decision by the Council of the European Union on increased incentives for the pharmaceutical industry , with the aim of selling drugs more cheaply .
The report 's acceptance of subsidies to renew the fleet , export subsidies and duty on and technocratic obstacles to imports provocatively strengthens certain businessmen and makes the international division of labour even more unfair here , at the expense of poor and developing countries .
We agree with several points in the report at debate .
The problem cannot be resolved within the framework of organisations such as UNESCO or the Council of Europe , let alone the ΕU.
Of course , immigration policy cannot mean just guarding borders , it cannot only be identified with repressive measures , repatriation and readmission .
Equally immoral is the stance of those who , with opportunistic and expedient positions and practices , feed xenophobia and racism in Europe in an endeavour to raise new Berlin walls in people 's minds and conscience .
Only if their rights are respected will people of different origins and cultures feel part of the society in which they legally live and work , bearers of rights and obligations with their say on their everyday life , work , education , language learning , housing , health services , social services , their cultural environment and their political activities .
That is why special measures need to be taken to combat discrimination and facilitate their integration into social and professional life .
What is the particular role , the position , the influence of Syria in the Barcelona process ?
We cannot deal with this matter with this sort of technocracy and without a sensitive reply by the President-in-Office of the Council and I call for a material response .     .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the initiative to draft this report derives from our common conviction of the need to speed up the Barcelona process and , specifically , the need to strengthen the European economy and the European job market by creating new , high-quality jobs .
Over the last 20 years , around 2/3 of the growth in the gross domestic product of the European Union has come from the services sector , while the greatest increase in the employment rate has again been in this sector .
The countries with the most serious structural problems , such as Greece and Portugal , have the lowest employment rates in services .
There are still very inflexible regulations , however , which are stifling economic activity .
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs calls on the European Commission to publish a White Paper , proposing separate employment policies for each sector , so that we soon see the completion of a successful European market .
Investment is also needed in innovation in the services sector , because at the moment industry has the greatest interest in investment in innovation .
As Mrs Kratsa said , there is a close connection between the development of an economy and the percentage of employment in the services sector .
I would remind you that guideline 2 refers very specifically to entrepreneurship , to the link between creating jobs and entrepreneurship , and the Member States are called on to encourage innovation in entrepreneurship , the ability to invest and a favourable business environment for all businesses .
We cannot develop services if we do not invest in human resources .
So , taking account of these three sectors : first , the specific guidelines in the strategy on employment which essentially and to a large extent relate to the need to develop services ; secondly , the need for investment in human resources and , thirdly , the directive on services within the framework of the internal market , I think that , on the part of the European Union , there is an important framework which could help the Member States to implement their individual national policies .
There is no sector of the economy which does not require services , including the private sector , or in which the services provided are not acquiring greater and greater interest .
However , the cross-border provision of services is still failing to progress .
I should also like to remind you that the services sector is the sector for taking up people with disabilities and keeping elderly people as active members in the market .
