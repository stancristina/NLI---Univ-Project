the dream of millions of European citizens , of working people who continue to fight tirelessly for their own society of justice and equality , of harmonious development , the centrepiece of which should be mankind and universal values , not profit and money .
The introduction of the common currency is accompanied by the breaking up of the so-called European social state , with dramatic repercussions for the employment , social and social security rights of working people .
The so-called independence of the European Central Bank , which is now being set up , will effectively marginalize people and allow the money markets to make decisions not only without the irksome interventions of popular movements but also without the intervention of governments themselves .
This will highlight even more clearly the consequences for Europe of multiple speeds and concentric circles .
A Europe of Socialism .
He acquitted himself with prudence , moderation and insight .
Tomorrow morning at 8.00 a.m. in the Palais , the Greek Members of the European Parliament will hold a short memorial service to honour Konstantinos Karamanlis and all those colleagues who would like to take part will be welcome .
On the contrary , we believe that , whether the report or the common position wishes it or not , these regulations make it easier for oligopolies and monopolies to lay their hands on these biotechnological discoveries and inventions and to apply them on behalf - always - of their own unregulated and inhuman profit .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I have read with great care the report by the venerable professor , Mr Cabrol .
I therefore wonder how strong the legal basis is , which Mr Cabrol mentioned .
Thirdly , I do not accept the claim of those colleagues who said that whoever has reservations concerning the report has no interest in public health , because many of those colleagues have given their support to the free circulation of soft drugs , as if soft drugs did not constitute a danger to public health or to society .
However , there are negative aspects to this directive .
This same Commission and the Council decided to move premises in Brussels and to have their premises reconstructed at a cost of billions because asbestos is harmful , and yet they do not include it in the directive by excluding asbestos piping for the distribution of water .
Mr President , on the basis of what the Commissioner has said , I have a written text from competent organizations to the effect that the 1997 revision of the WTO accepted that there was no scientific basis for the rumoured acute effects on health of copper in drinking water and described the recommendation which it had made at that time as provisional .
Or perhaps the Commissioner was not fully informed and answered in that way in order to stick to the fact that she did not accept the amendments , in other words to transfer copper from 1B to 1C , and remained silent with regard to the failure to mention asbestos as one of the dangerous materials .
The first obstacle is - and I think Mr Perry also referred to it - the reduced sums of money utilized by the European Union .
The third obstacle , in my opinion , is the need to retain a cultural dimension , especially in matters relating to language .
Mr President , the Europe of Knowledge and learning in the global information society of today and tomorrow must be the main objective , I believe , of the European Union .
Moreover , the Amsterdam Treaty has already given a clear direction to the European Union towards this objective as an obligation in the broader sense .
In very simple terms this means that our greatest effort must be directed towards our young people , that is to say , the future of tomorrow and the future of today .
I believe , for example , that the proposal which is contained in this programme , that in other words there must be a common axis for action to enable this activity to be better coordinated and supervised , is quite right .
This will not only provide working people with the opportunity of achieving life-long retraining but will enable the unemployed to gain access to the world of work .
The Commission 's proposals are adapted to our weaknesses .
How would we react to this attempt to surrender our children to the powers of profit and money and to total indifference to anything else ?
The protection of minors and the protection of human dignity in audiovisual services and in information services in general is a very important issue in an age of electronic convergence .
The rapporteur for his part provides significant clarifications concerning self-regulation and judges it desirable to advance European cooperation to strengthen the effectiveness of technical measures and to determine a common ethical approach .
It will also be independent of informal centres of power , as was shown by the political accommodation reached in Brussels , a body which regards itself as committed to implementing a tough monetarist policy , aimed at monetary stability and low interest rates , and fundamentally ignoring the effects this policy has on the social condition of the people of the European Union .
With regard to the candidates , the Treaty lays down that they are pan-European personalities of known repute and professional competence .
We hope that these two large institutions will cooperate to stabilize the international money system and the global economy .
On the other hand , the starting point of the charter of the Federal Reserve is the autonomous need for a central bank to supply money to the economy , taking care equally of price stability , employment and a logical level for interest rates
