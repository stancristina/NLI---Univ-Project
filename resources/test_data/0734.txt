The local population along the coastlines will be deprived of its livelihood and will be reduced to living on aid , aid moreover that rarely provides adequate compensation or makes up for the lost income .
The proposals in Mr Guerreiro 's report do not , however , include such measures and I have therefore voted against the report .
In this context , at least two thirds of the money goes on agriculture and on structural funds , including waste and corruption .
What the EU should invest money in , for example , large-scale research such as the fusion project in Barcelona , or common infrastructure such as Galileo , or the separation and storage of carbon dioxide etc. , are small fry in this budget .
There is no reason why they should receive money from other countries in this connection .
We are talking about rich countries that would have no difficulty dealing with these matters , without receiving scraps from other Member States .
Next time , funds will no doubt go on snow clearance .
The country thus took a substantial step forward on its way towards membership of the EU , but the work is very far from complete .
The issue of state property in the Brƒçko district is still unresolved .
In this connection , as in connection with the range of other challenges faced by Bosnia , it is very important that the international community should stand united .
It is just as dangerous to believe that the commitment of the international community can decrease now that Bosnia has made a certain amount of progress and that the international military presence is continually being reduced .
The June List believes that the EU budget should be limited to 1 % of the Member States ' average GNI.
The June List also believes that something needs to be done about the European Parliament 's constant shuttling between Strasbourg and Brussels and that the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions should be disbanded .
In order to win this trust , we must make the internal market more efficient and sensitive to citizens ' expectations and problems .
This is , of course , also a good thing for the market itself .
Therefore , the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection and I welcome the Consumer Markets Scoreboard that the Commission presented at the request of the Committee .
It is , of course , impossible to examine in detail all aspects of the internal market .
I would also like to stress the importance of raising awareness of the Scoreboard amongst consumers themselves and the general public .
We must be patient and give this Consumer Markets Scoreboard time .
The majority agreed to reduce direct aid by only 6 % for 2009 and 2010 .
Under the original proposal , this switchover would have applied to subsidies from EUR 5 000 per annum and upwards .
The European Parliament 's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , as usual , has chosen a different route from that chosen by the Commission .
The June List wants to abolish the common agricultural policy and we would observe that it is fortunate that the European Parliament does not have powers of codecision in respect of the EU 's agricultural policy .
This aid is to the detriment of global competition , which we know is a precondition for prosperity , it justifies the reforms that are required in the agricultural sector and it reduces the choice available to us , the consumers .
What is more , the majority pushed through the establishment of a special milk fund .
The proposal also means a transfer of money from direct aid for agricultural production to rural development , with the focus on the four prioritised areas of climate change , renewable energy , water management and biodiversity .
Such a system creates an unnecessary and bureaucratic procedure in which those Member States requiring help in reality become dependent on EMU countries with outsider-imposed requirements for 'political and economic measures ' .
Countries that are members of the European Union - as they should be - but are not members of the monetary union - as they should not be - are forced to keep a fixed exchange rate with the euro and thus with their most important trading partners .
We believe instead that those countries that are members of the EU but have not joined the monetary union should maintain a regime with a floating exchange rate .
For us social democrats , a consistently high level of safety was the top priority objective .
We are naturally disappointed by this , but as we feel that the new directive is otherwise an improvement on the current one , we will support it in plenary .
The precautionary principle has also been one of the most significant improvements .
We welcome the fact that the new directive requires toys not to impair hearing .
We also welcome the fact that the rules for warnings have been made clearer and that more types of toys are to have warning text on the toys themselves , as otherwise it is easy for the warning to be forgotten once the packaging has been removed .
Time and again we hear of products being recalled because they are dangerous for our children .
It shows that improved legislation is required , but also improved monitoring .
Therefore the legislation must also apply to broken toys , as some hazardous substances are then released .
Children 's safety is more important than short-term economic gains .
The June List is therefore of the opinion that the updating of current legislation in the area is welcome , but at the same time I would like to warn against ill-concealed protectionism .
It must be possible
