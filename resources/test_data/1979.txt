research in this field , which was very important .
We also reinforced the national inspection authorities for veterinary and human health , which also proved to be highly necessary .
Even if the Committee 's work is over , we have to note that BSE is not .
Now it is often the case that people only do something about an epidemic once it is upon them , and that reduces the interest in fighting it .
So it is vital that the rules we have laid down are followed so that there is no such weakening of interest in combatting BSE.
I would therefore call on the Commission to follow the demands we have made on it in the committee , to try to regionalize BSE so that areas where there has been no BSE and which meet the rules on identifying cows and calves are declared BSE-free for the simple reason that this will encourage areas where there is BSE to step up the fight against the disease .
Finally , I would say that I regret to some extent that it was necessary to set up this committee , but on the other hand I have to admit that , when you have an organization which is as heavy as the Commission , it is sometimes necessary to attack it to get it to do its work better .
So it has also proved necessary to put pressure on it to get it to do its work better , and that has succeeded for the moment .
I hope there is no need to set up another committee of inquiry in the near future .
( DA ) The Danish Social Democrats have today voted in favour of the proposals on Turkey and establishing the Community 's position on the Customs Union Joint Committee .
We are in no doubt that the European Parliament 's influence on this subject has already given democracy strength in Turkey .
To get public assistance , Turkey should observe human rights , accept and follow the rules of democracy and developments in the country should be monitored by a supervisory body .
Mr President , I can only say that I agree with the additional remarks completely .
I have already had an opportunity to have discussions with the animal welfare group here in Parliament , and I certainly think we will get some results too .
No, the Commission has not had an opportunity to look into this matter .
I am aware that the Swedish authorities held an environmental assessment of the project themselves at an early stage of the proceedings , and I can perhaps say for Mr Virgin 's information that we have of course now amended the directive in question as Directive 97/11/EC , which must be implemented by the Member States by 14 March 1999 .
If the environmental assessment Directive had been in force , it would have been possible to intervene and hold a new assessment , but this cannot be done with the existing Directive .
As I said to Mr Virgin , it is of course always interesting when an incident happens to consider whether it could have been avoided , and if it would have been better if another Directive had been in force .
As I said in reply to Mr Virgin 's supplementary question , the matter would have looked different if it was a question of Directive 97/11/EC , but this Directive will not be implemented by the Member States until March 1999 , and until it is implemented , we cannot of course use the provisions it contains .
I would like to thank the Commissioner for his reply .
I feel it is annoying that there have been problems with the administration of the PACTE programme , because if people do not get the resources which they are due , this puts the EU in a bad light .
Can the Commissioner set a fixed time limit for the payments ?
Mr President , Mr Commissioner , there is so much talk about what the Union should look at .
But here we really do have a field which the Union should be seriously involved in .
It is appropriate to discuss safety on board aircraft arriving in the Union from non-Member States .
Here we have aircraft which are operating on behalf of companies who are subject to Community legislation but which are in fact owned by companies outside the Union .
Air traffic is increasing , partly because fares are falling , but also because demand is rising .
The aircraft which are replaced are not always put into retirement , but simply go to another company in new colours .
People should feel safe when they travel .
But we are also finding that aircraft safety , especially in aircraft from non-Member States , is not meeting the requirements we set .
Of course , there may be different proposals and isolated action by Member States , but that will not be effective .
So we need to coordinate our efforts and exchange experience to enable aircraft and airlines which fail to meet safety requirements to be excluded quickly .
With this proposed Directive , we have taken a major step within the EU towards people 's safety when they travel .
Madame President , the Commission 's proposal to integrate the gender aspect as an important factor in development cooperation has the right aim .
Karin Juncker talks about equal rights , but with the gender role pattern in the developing countries , what we need is rather positive discrimination in favour of women .
We must support women directly through allocating ground , loans , better equipment and technology .
The Commission 's general mainstream approach could be part of this strategy , if the principle is otherwise put into practice and does not remain empty words
