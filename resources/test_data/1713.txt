media actively contributes to a single way of thinking , to wars and to the dismantling of the welfare state , we have to give a sign that we are changing direction or , at least , rethinking things .
The third point I want to underline in this report is the recommendations it makes .
I heard Mrs Angelilli refer in her speech to certain Members , whose names she did not give , and she stated that these persons falsified signatures in the European Parliament register .
What has happened ?
The topic was brought before this Parliament by means of a resolution signed by myself and 31 other Members of the Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats or other groups on the Right , because it goes much deeper than Italy and concerns a value which belongs to the whole of Europe and every civilisation .
Neither TG1 nor the Canale 5 news programmes – the television news programmes owned by Mr Berlusconi or those that the rapporteur says are controlled by the Italian Government – are not Al-Jazeera , even though every evening , until a few evenings ago , seeing an elegant leftist woman calling the guerrillas ‘resistance fighters ’ and the attacks on westerners ‘resistance ’ might have made you think so .
It is such a poorly made report that the President of Parliament himself , Pat Cox , in reply to a letter by Mr Podestà , says that , even though they are admissible , certain parts of the text need changing so as to comply fully with parliamentary practice and our Rules of Procedure .
In view of the complete abolition of controls at the internal borders between Member States , the objective is to transfer these controls to their external borders , while increasing judicial , customs and police cooperation with what might be termed compensatory measures to safeguard the security of European Union territory .
What it cannot do is take data collected for commercial purposes and use them for security purposes .
Mr President , we agree with your second proposal , to vote on the original text first .     – Mr President , I should just like to say that my group agrees to your proposal to vote on the original report paragraph by paragraph .
In connection with what certain Members have said , I remind Mr Barón Crespo – who criticised an article by Mr Podestà – that this mysterious , as he puts it , centre-left coalition has already published a pamphlet taking the approval of this report in this House as a certainty and making a whole series of remarks , even though the report has not yet even been put to the vote .
I therefore respect the President’s decision but , I beg you , do not hide behind a problem that does not exist and which , in any case , is not yours , just because you do not want to respond to a specific request by Mr Hernández Mollar .
Of course , we were once again saddened at the attempt by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance , accompanied in this action by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and by some Italian left-wing democrats – with an amendment which , fortunately , only received about 50 votes – to abort the continuation of the plan for the Messina bridge on the trans-European route from Berlin to Palermo .
If the amendment had been passed , over and above the very serious detrimental effect , which was mentioned at the end of the procedure , the Italian Government – which has already launched the process to begin construction of the bridge – would not have received the 10 % contribution from the Union’s funds , as provided for in the Treaty .
We would have expected passion and severity in denouncing the arbitrary use that is , unfortunately , often made of the fight against terrorism to repress dissidents .
Furthermore , the fact that this was drawn up and signed by minorities known for being anti-Europeanist quite clearly exposes this intention .
The support of the British Conservatives once again clearly shows the untenable association of this group with the European People’s Party tradition , so well represented by Mrs Grossetête and also by Mrs Avilés Perea .
Is he aware of being converted into one of the most fervent supporters of the European Commission ?
Eurostatis an institution which , through its surveying and statistical work , is in fact the guarantor of the Stability and Growth Pact : it monitors the application of the Maastricht criteria .
The Eurostat dossier has compromised the image of the European Commission and its President , who – in our opinion – would do well to draw from it the necessary consequences .
When talking about this liberalisation , which some are demonising , I would like to call for us not ever to forget that our focus and our objective are the users of this service .
The sentence is not based on the proceedings of this trial , but explicit reference is made to the 1994 sentence .
At the moment , frankly , the conditions for opening negotiations do not exist .     Mr President , I believe that I can say to you and to my fellow Members that the explanations that Mr Barón Crespo has just given are the most pathetic that I have heard in ten years of parliamentary life here .
This system has been going on for a long time .
This itself is a distortion , to which is added a further one , which I pointed out pursuant to the Rules of Procedure .
I would , however , inform my fellow Members that , in adopting paragraph 62 they have condemned the Italian governments of the last few decades , including the D’Alema Government
