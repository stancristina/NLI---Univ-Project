Union ' s stability and association agreement with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is to establish stability and peace in the area , and this , of course , presupposes developing and maintaining good neighbourly relations between the countries involved .
Mr President , this is because I do not think that the harmonious day to day relations , contacts and communication between FYROM and Greece that have actually been achieved at both bipartite and multipartite level , and this mainly thanks to the practical arrangements of the intermediate agreement , I repeat , I do not think these sufficiently cover the conditions and criteria of good neighbourliness necessary , inter alia , for negotiating and concluding an association agreement .
Mr President , the agreement we are debating today , as analysed by Mr Swoboda , which I hope we will adopt tomorrow , constitutes the second politically positive step , after the stability pact for the area .
Under those conditions , then , there has been a real failure .
In that area , there have been various policies from time to time , and what the European Union should guard against is the risk that , for ultimately superficial reasons , it may help to create banana republics elsewhere .
Let us not deceive ourselves : a Europe , one part of which is being held back because of frictions , misinterpretations and conflicts , and because of nationalistic clashes , will never be a Europe that has brought its own house to the level it wants .
I say this just so that we know where we stand .
What did I understand on reading the related texts ?
In my opinion , the Legal Affairs Committee and the rapporteur Mr Di Pietro have produced some very interesting work .
A child , a student or a pupil who smokes hashish in one country is dealt with in an educational way , while in another country he is treated as a criminal and locked up in the universities of crime constituted by the corrective system and the prisons .
.
There are different types of agreements or relations or lack of relations - going even as far as the embargo on Yugoslavia - which result in a fragmented and ineffectual approach .
There is no sense of regionality for the Balkans , which would include everyone without exceptions or vindictiveness .
Mr President , Commissioner , before I explain to you the position of the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities , I would like to share with you three basic factors which , in my opinion , determine the present and future of European tourism in an international environment .
It is therefore clear that besides being a matter of general economic interest for Europe , tourism is a priority for the economic and social participation of the European Union ' s regions .
You see , the world tourism market is influenced every day and directly by the liberalisation of transport , its reduced cost , and competition from new centres of tourism outside Europe .
We must take very serious note of the need to upgrade the human resources engaged in tourism , so that tourism will be able to respond to the new technological challenges of our age .
To this new labour market there must be a response in the programmes of tourism schools and training programmes for company staff , including programmes for training the unemployed and their re-introduction to work .
The lack of any legal base makes it impossible to adopt measures relating to the sector .
But we must support our tourism !
In contrast , at European level it would be possible to look into measures for improving the relations between hotels and Tour Operators , for example a regulation of such relations , the promotion of a special bankruptcy fund , etc. , in collaboration with representatives from the two branches .
Such measures must also aim to promote rational use of natural and cultural assets and of the tourism infrastructure , so contributing to the balanced and sustainable development of tourism .
As is known , the Commission should already , before the end of 1998 , have tabled new proposals for a revision of the Postal Services Directive 97/67 , guaranteeing the continued provision of a universal service , securing its economic viability , and regulating the gradual liberalisation of the postal services market while taking into account the consequences of this for all those involved , including postal workers and customers .
With liberalisation , how will it be possible for the universal postal service to be funded and to operate correctly in a country such as my own , Greece , with its particular geographical features and its numerous , small but inhabited islands ?
It will most certainly be necessary , we say , because of the technological developments that simplify this transfer and thereby make it more profitable , to determine the further gradual and controlled liberalisation by setting weight and price limits .
But what will those limits be ?
It is self-evident that liberalisation is not an end in itself , but only a means towards improving services .
Today , we are turning a blind eye to the involvement of NATO occupation forces in the savage ethnic cleansing of the Serbs and non-Albanian speaking minorities .
That is why this job went to Mr Solana , the Secretary-General of NATO , who is also guilty of the crimes committed against Yugoslavia ; the right man for the right job , against whom charges have been filed , calling for him to be tried as a war criminal .
It pains me to look at you and I despair on listening to you ; that applies both to what you say about games with little soldiers , as Mrs Maes just put it , and what you do not say .
