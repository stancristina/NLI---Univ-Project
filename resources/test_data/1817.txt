measure the progress made towards sustainability on a regular and ongoing basis .
Nevertheless , in common with Members in other groups – and I am glad to have heard the speaker before me – I must highlight a number of aspects that I consider very important .
The new policies must therefore be based on a feasible project for sustainable development that all peoples in the world can enjoy without distinction .
I challenge the Council , which is present here today , to say something in that regard .
Support for such funding may come from two sources : one resulting from the general public concern that we must defend ourselves against possible terrorist attacks , and the other resulting from individual fear , in that each passenger as such produces a demand for additional security .
Currently , the situation in Europe as regards the way these measures are funded is extremely varied and not necessarily very fair or correct .
In drawing up the common rule , we have also had to address matters of detail that are very much in the public eye , such as the problem of on-board security .
While I believe that the Commission should confine itself to laying down minimum standards and carrying out checks by means of regular as well as unannounced inspections , I consider it excessive that the Commission should be able to decide by itself whether a State can continue to apply more stringent measures or not .
The first is that Mr Savary is certainly right in saying that the new system should include everything that is new .
The European Union should not force our fishermen to accept restrictions and sacrifices while leaving non-EU fleets in the Mediterranean completely free to do as they like .
Secondly , insufficient attention has been devoted to producers ’ associations and the positive role that they could play in contributing to the socio-economic development of fisheries-dependent communities .
The future regulation for the Mediterranean , for instance , should provide for adjustments to be put forward at a national level .
The Italian delegation from the Margherita party supported these amendments .
There was an attempt to justify this proposal by the need for us to fall in line with those non-European countries that already authorise this practice .
The use of ‘modern ’ oenological practices in many third countries and the less rigorous application of the 'wholly obtained ' rule worldwide are excluding our products from our very own market , a market that , on its own , represents two-thirds of global trade in wine .
Only a clear label corresponding to the product’s content will ensure that the information is transparent .
Is this that promotion of the quality of agricultural products about which we talk so much ?
We will certainly not succeed in stopping it , but we need appropriate guarantees .
Contrary to the view expressed by Mr Poettering , I am convinced that the experience gained in 2000 served to strengthen the European ethos of your government and that it was an important experience not only for yourself but also for the whole of Europe .
At this juncture I should like to make an appeal to my fellow Members .
We must instead draw up a clear proposal in order to meet the next deadlines .
Mr President , I am very sorry to tell you too that this Presidency will be remembered for an unprecedented increase in the European budget for research into nuclear power , with the result that a continent almost entirely lacking in non-renewable energy sources has decided to favour , with investments four or five times higher than before , a dangerous type of technology rather than confronting the problem of energy efficiency and renewable energy .
One more thing , Mr President , very quickly : it is not true that immigration was discussed for the first time at the last European Council .
Mr Schüssel has given us positive guidelines concerning the fundamental role of small and medium-sized enterprises : he has described them as part of Europe’s hidden potential .
Without the Constitutional Treaty there will be no People’s Europe , nor a European Union capable of fulfilling its role .
It says 'and ' and not 'or ' in the article but , in actual fact , only members representing interests were appointed .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to speak about a serious incident that took place only a few hours ago : 18 emigrants have drowned while heading for the Canary Islands , and another two emigrants were found dead this morning at the Melilla fence , between Morocco and Spain .
I would also mention the explicit recognition of the need for directors to have a relationship of dependency and for transparency with regard to remuneration as well , together with the guaranteed rights of workers and their representatives to participate in company decision-making .
This is in response to the recipient Member States’ great financial needs in the environmental and transport sectors , with special attention paid to sustainable development , through a form of balanced yet flexible distribution , that is to say , one that is capable of adapting the way in which the Fund is used to meet the needs of each Member State .
Next , with regard to the so-called partnership , there will be greater involvement of bodies representing civil society , non-governmental organisations and associations that campaign for equal rights between women and men , including in terms of cohesion policy .
We believe that the consultation procedure is a great school for democracy and , above all , a great resource in terms of responsibility : extending the scope of responsibility in the management of the Structural Funds is one of the major political challenges facing the European Union .
