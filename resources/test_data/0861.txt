We ask the Commission not to limit this standardisation of reporting formalities to the Community .
They have now had many years to prepare for and take control of the possible consequences .
Turkey has not even fixed a precise timetable for fulfilling the political criteria of Copenhagen .
Secondly , Commissioner , your proposal contains a renationalisation , which is the cause of a great deal of suspicion , because , to a certain extent , it sets a precedent in this field .
With regard to the supplementary premium that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development proposed and approved , I have to say that the Commission should be very vigilant that this supplementary premium should in no case be used to reduce the linear premium , the headage premium or the premium for rural development .
This premium is much needed , because it has remained unaltered since 1994 ; in fact , it has stagnated .
.
The development cooperation policy should become more involved , with more economic , financial and technical measures , as requested by our report and as shown in the information given in the explanatory statement .
I think that the criticisms voiced in the Lannoye report on the agreements with Mauritania and Senegal are completely unfounded .
I could even say the same for the Parliamentary Committees in this House .
Fisheries agreements allow them to obtain financial resources in return for giving the Community fleet fishing rights on various perishable resources whose capture , processing and marketing , require specialist companies and methods that these countries do not have themselves .
I have mentioned the case of Mozambique , but it would be unfair not to say that there are other very positive aspects to this African country ' s efforts to move forward , and there are other African countries which are acting well in relation to fishing , such as Namibia , to give but one example .
Naturally , this approach also goes for the actions of the united Europe in its relations with other countries , in particular the developing countries .
As well as respecting our partners and their rights as owners of those waters , we must learn the necessary lessons from our experience , which led us to exhaust the fish stocks off our coasts .
As I have said , the Socialist Group supports Mrs Attwooll ' s report , which was approved by consensus in the Committee on Fisheries , and we thank her for the compromise achieved in our committee , together with the Members presenting amendments , a compromise which the Council is still far from reaching .
Mr President , I would also like to thank Mrs Attwooll for her cooperation leading to a compromise which , in my opinion , very much improves the Commission ' s two proposals , which were originally untimely and doomed not to be complied with .
And extension , Commissioner , cannot in any way be used to change the rules of the game which we have had up to now .
We want it to draw attention , on the one hand , to the fact that the increase in onboard safety measures has nothing to do with increasing fishing capacity or power , and on the other , to the need not to introduce substantial last-minute changes to programmes which have been in operation for five years , because an annual extension is one thing , but to change fundamental conditions in the general philosophy of the MAGPs now , at the last minute , is quite another .
In this case , fishing opportunities really exist and , being a Southern agreement , any interested Member State could chose to make use of them , just as in other categories of this same agreement entry has been granted to fleets that are not traditionally present in the area , such as those from Italy or Greece .
Fortunately , this time , the fleet has not been docked as it was five years ago .
Community fishing activity in itself does not interfere with small-scale fleets , since our fleet does not have access to the twelve mile zone .
But , having said that , I believe things are reaching the point where clarification is necessary from several points of view .
Mr President , the Group of the Party of European Socialists supports this proposed regulation on the renewal of the fisheries agreement with Madagascar .
This agreement , like all fisheries agreements with third countries , is aimed at a specific form of fishing - in this case , tuna - clearly outside the 6-12 mile zone , and includes absolutely limited and measured annual fishing opportunities for an also limited and measured number of ships - 80 .
The shipowners pay an amount per tonne - EUR 25 - which , as the rapporteur has pointed out , is something that only happens in the Southern agreements .
This information is misleading , particularly at a time when Parliament is making a substantial effort to proceed with the emergency procedure on anti-terrorist legislation , and I think it was a serious mistake , because it has led to confusion that has had a negative effect on everyone concerned .
Madam President , if it is at all possible , I would like to add an oral amendment : 'on the effects of hurricane Michelle on Nicaragua , Cuba and Honduras ' , which is where it has caused the most damage .
And secondly , I would like to express my concern at the lack of transparency shown by the Council to this Parliament , for I have had no official answer to my question .
Therefore , Mr President , in the vote that is going to take place
