Time after time we are told that when multi-annual programmes are starting their third or fourth programme period we are now in the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development , the third LIFE programme , etc . a whole year is often needed in order to start up activities at the beginning of a new period .
This year we decided not to use flexibility for new posts in the Commission .
I would now briefly like to address some of the actual problems in each budget area .
We also propose that subsidies for the export of live animals should be reduced and accounted for separately .
Heading 2 : the Structural Funds .
This is the most important political question but nevertheless , fisheries policy must also be reformed .
At the same time we have chosen not to adopt a position on how this is to be funded in detail , we will return to that at a later date .
We do not accept the Council 's and the Commission 's proposal for comprehensive slimming down of information policy .
I would also like to point to the external authorities , the agencies .
Unfortunately we have to say that this is not always the case .
Therefore I believe that this is a matter we will need to discuss somewhat in the future .
Finally , I would like to concentrate on heading 4 , external policies .
This year it is Afghanistan and the Global Health Fund , support to the fight against AIDS and other poverty-related illnesses in the developing world .
Costs have increased every year without any new resources being allocated .
It must be resolved if we are to achieve an acceptable role for the EU 's external actions .
I believe this is an issue which we must discuss very carefully between the first and the second readings .
We have resolved them in broad agreement .
I would like to thank all my fellow members of the Committee on Budgets , the highly competent budget secretariat , the Presidium , above all today 's President and , finally , the Commission , the Council and , especially , a very pragmatic and proactive Danish Presidency .
Although this was reduced in various stages during the spring , the Commission in its preliminary draft budget proposed that the flexibility instrument be used to the tune of EUR 66 million , primarily to cover the Commission 's costs in completing the preparations for enlargement .
The second reason was because , together with other areas where the flexibility instrument has already been earmarked , this would use up half the instrument and thus make it impossible for it to be used in areas where significantly better use could presumably be made of it .
Within this framework , the priorities which Parliament had supported even in the guidelines were entirely feasible , these being primarily two things .
The second priority was implementing necessary reforms .
These will be required with or without enlargement , especially when it comes to Parliament .
Furthermore , it is about strengthening Parliament 's legislative function .
It was a question of distribution across all the institutions , with approaching enlargement as the main priority in this context too .
This promise has subsequently been repeated on numerous occasions both by me and other representatives of both the Council and Parliament .
At a meeting attended by the secretaries-general of all the institutions , we thus produced a total sum of approximately EUR 77 million remaining unused by all the institutions in total .
This is money which in fact , in line with the far-sighted way of handling money which Parliament has used hitherto , we should have spent on early repayments on Parliament 's own properties .
In this context , let me mention that the original proposal was for EUR 40 million .
This shows that this frontloading , as I see it , is developing into a considerable success and could also be used in other contexts in the future .
We now stand here having implemented frontloading which gives us the opportunity to comply with what we promised .
It is a joint undertaking .
As we all know , this is due to the fact that the considerable information initiatives financed by the EU budget ahead of the introduction of the single currency are now behind us .
There was broad agreement within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs that the information initiatives should be concentrated on those countries which have not yet introduced the single currency and , to a certain extent , also on candidate countries , which will introduce the single currency one day .
The fact that this amendment was rejected becomes even more regrettable when we consider that at least one , and perhaps more , of the current Member States is highly likely to hold a referendum on the single currency next year .
As Wim Duisenberg , chairman of the European Central Bank , says , the Central Bank has never had any problem selling its product .
I would like to stress this on behalf of Parliament .
We know that these diseases create enormous difficulties and problems for millions of people and that years of development work are quickly eroded due to these diseases causing so much sickness and death .
Until very recently , the Commission has also done very little within the framework of its aid .
Thank you for this contribution .
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11.30 a.m.
When the Israeli Government publishes these details , we as members of the European Parliament naturally wish to get to the bottom of the matter .
Long-term studies of population groups in various European countries should be something which the EU could contribute in order to achieve good results .
What we are now discussing is
