Only binding targets on emissions are valid .
In any case , this has already happened , and with good results .
Employment is an issue in Europe .
It might go the other way .
The effects on employment of this are unfathomable .
Mr President , in general let me say that in its present shape the directive on waste disposal at landfill sites is satisfactory .
The tax or payment should be such that clean , sorted waste will be cheapest , and unsorted waste to be taken to landfill sites will be the most expensive to produce .
This will obviously mean that local authorities and other responsible bodies will organize proper methods of sorting waste .
We must support the use of landside waste , for example , as a source of energy or soil improvement agent , but at the same time new technology must be developed to ensure that the process will not harm the environment or health .
The biggest problems are the use of hormones and antibiotics , the use of substances that are prohibited .
We cannot , however , fully rely on the chemical industry in this matter when , under the guise of added ingredients , they produce substances harmful to humans .
A good example of that is the use of asthma medicines at the Olympics : sportsmen and women appear to be severely asthmatic .
The Commission is being more responsible in wishing to establish how these substances are being used .
The report also delves into the problems and doubts which consumers indisputably still have regarding genetic engineering .
The report acknowledges that genetically altered food will have an effect on consumers ' behavioural patterns .
For that reason we require research , sufficiently broad in scope , on the safety of genetically manipulated products , because it is only with scientifically documented data , effectively disseminated , that we will dispel the fears of consumers .
In this way the Union would recognize its importance and be prepared to fund it .
But we cannot accept , even in the name of free trade , any method whatsoever to increase food productivity .
We are qualitycompetitive , as Mr Fischler has said .
We are now aware of the consequences of using genetic engineering in agriculture .
Using genetically modified plants in open natural systems can have damaging effects which we have no way of assessing today .
We cannot support it .
In this case , the advantage of spraying that the pests are only affected for a short period and so cannot become resistant .
This is by no means unproblematic .
We cannot allow the profit motive in agriculture to take precedence over human health and the environment .
Instead of putting resources into researching methods as uncertain as genetic engineering , we should focus on an area which is largely unresearched : that is , we should put more resources into finding out how Nature 's own mechanisms combat pests and plants .
Mr President , the Community 's own resources are made up of gross domestic product , value added tax and customs duties .
For example , Holland charges a considerable amount of customs duty for transit traffic , adds it to its own net contribution and says it is paying money to the EU , although , in actual fact , it is EU money which it is only accounting for to the EU.
A corresponding sum could then be due to the EU in the shape of GDP.
It would solve the problem , but it would be a very radical solution .
Member States do not gain from the fact that they do not collect customs duty according to common regulations .
In assessing depreciation in bookkeeping , Member States might thereby try to shake off responsibility for mistakes .
It is important to focus sufficient attention on big issues like this .
This is one of the cankers in our agricultural policy , quite apart from cases of malpractice in the meat trade .
It is obvious that imported maize is , at least in Portugal , being mixed with EU maize at considerable profit .
The fault in the system does not end there but also crops up in Agenda 2000 negotiations .
When it is a matter of zero-sum games being played with agriculture in the EU or a spiralling dive to fund enlargement , we pass the problem of maize quotas in Agenda 2000 talks on to Finnish dairy farmers .
The experience that individual citizens , students and people doing research derive from multi-cultural colleges throughout Europe is far more valuable than any of the diverse proposals for projects from the Commission with the name of Citizens ' Europe .
So the greatest challenge rests with the applicant countries .
They themselves must be able to modernize and adapt their educational systems and colleges so that they can guarantee the quality of their exchange programmes regarding course content , administration and the external aspect .
To take just one example , I am afraid I can cite the University of Tartu in Estonia , where Finns studying there have already taken the university authorities to court right in the middle of term over massive fee increases .
The exchange programmes rely on reciprocity , which cannot in all reason be based on decisions made in court .
Mr President , last Friday there was a disastrous train crash in Finland in which ten people died and almost forty were injured .
Mr President , I would like to ask a rhetorical question .
How do you explain a situation in which ECU 1.5 billion worth of animal hormones are sold in the EU every year , although their use is prohibited ?
We were once in a position to avoid animal and plant disease through border controls , preventing the
