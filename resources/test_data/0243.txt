I have noticed that recent events have borne out my predictions on 15 March and 3 May .
.
It no longer looks as if the euro will gain a position as an international currency , as the dollar has .
It will be at least two years before the first countries join after which there will be at least two years in which these countries will have to function in the exchange rate mechanism .
We must not tie ourselves down too early , a lot can happen in the meantime .
The Wuori report deals in a realistic way with this concept .
I also note the lack of a distinction between human rights and government policy objectives .
The attempt in Amendment No 24 to call attention to the position of terminal patients is in itself praiseworthy , but the concrete form it is given is misguided .
All attention focused on the way in which human rights reports in the European Parliament should be produced in future .
Moreover , we must not forget that the Member States are also bound by human rights treaties of the Council of Europe and the United Nations and the specialised bodies .
Women are raped and no one can attain justice .
We must not as if the whole caste system is itself untouchable .
We are using double standards and that must change .
Identifying violations is one thing , monitoring them and doing something about them and especially encouraging the Council and the Commission to take up the matter is another .
I should like to quote China in this connection , candidate for the 2008 Olympic Games .
The Netherlands has a community of 12 000 Syrian Christians from Turkey who have fled to Western Europe over the years .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , given the fact that we are running late , I shall be very brief , but please allow me to state how important this moment is for me .
For the rest , I should like to assure Parliament that during the next six months , the fight against the trafficking in human beings in general , and the fight against the trafficking in women and children , in particular , will be one of our key priorities .
We therefore confirm our commitment to try to achieve this .
However , given the wish of the participants for more and regular information , a wish that was underlined by Mrs Jackson , but which certainly reflects the feeling of many among you , the presidency intends to organise informal meetings with the MEPs during the conference at regular intervals , thus allowing an exchange of ideas to take place about the progress and the state of affairs .
The Commission has recently published a study which shows that a reduction target which is twice as high as the current one is not a problem for us economically speaking .
The new US President , Mr Bush , has meanwhile rejected the Kyoto Protocol .
The US emission standards for Nox in 2003 are already stricter than what the Environment Ministers want within the framework of the directive on large furnaces in 2018 .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , it has been said in this House a number of times , and it is not unimportant : there is wide unanimity across the political divide on this issue , and you must support it in the forthcoming negotiations in Bonn .
We have not yet ratified the Protocol either , nor have we completed any clear , concrete plans of action .
Mr President , the world needs a powerful , political signal .
Kyoto should not remain an empty pledge .
We desperately need a warm-hearted approach to developing countries , and a fund that allows for adjustments being made .
As the President-in-Council stated a moment ago , we sang and lamented behind the scenes , but to no avail .
On the one hand , there are the detailed rules for implementing the preparatory phase which precedes the next Intergovernmental Conference , and on the other there is the issue of the role of the regional bodies in the construction of the Union .
It would be premature at this stage to give you a detailed response to this issue of content on behalf of the Council - for I am talking on behalf of the Council - but I am certain that this point will be addressed in due course .
All we need to do now is to wait for the international community itself to cooperate with the International Court of Justice .
Mr President , Commissioner , the economic relations between the EU and Yugoslavia are of a special kind .
As Mr Brok has already stated , it is not the case that the approval and spending of these funds are subject to very special conditions , but sound cooperation must be established with the political and safety committee because the EU' s aid to Yugoslavia must be granted in a politically coherent fashion .
It gives a powerful signal indicating what Parliament does and does not want .
The EP ' s Committee on Fisheries agrees with rapporteur Costa Neves where he states that both the Commission and the Council may actually be slightly too relaxed in some areas .
.
I have already drawn your attention to it .
It is now simply about appropriately spending the money that is available now and that was allocated in the previous budget .
Mr President , the agricultural budget is probably typified by strokes of good fortune as well as huge setbacks .
Is it possible to have insurance cover in place ?
Our group gives its unqualified support to the proposal of the European Commission .
Mr Mulder
