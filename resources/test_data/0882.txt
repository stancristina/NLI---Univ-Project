The programme has been particularly invaluable for Member States with small populations .
It has both opened new doors for students in those countries and brought new students in from other countries , thus strengthening highly-valued European interaction .
The main difference between Mrs Pack 's report and the Council 's position is that the latter is offering a sum of EUR 1550 million , whereas Mrs Pack and the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education and the Media are asking for EUR 2500 million for the next seven years .
Concerning the content of the Socrates programme , I would like to raise just one question : the report specifies that the study of languages should be limited to the official languages of the EU , as well as Irish and Letzebuergesch .
In the expanding Socrates process we need to ensure that individual participation in the programme is not made more difficult by such matters as underfunding .
It is important to take account of the financial situation of participants when deciding how to allocate funds .
The inclusion of adult learners and trained teaching staff in the programme will broaden its scope by appealing to a much larger section of the population .
I hope that the Council and the Commission will the give this issue the consideration it deserves and that the present Socrates programme will have a follow-up which is just as good as the current programme , supported by the funding proposed by Parliament .
Mr President , when we talk about tobacco products , we cannot overemphasise how much damage they cause to people 's health , not just active smokers but also those who are passively exposed to the carcinogenic effects of tobacco smoke against their will .
Tobacco is not just a national or regional problem , but very much a global one .
For example , the activities of American tobacco companies in Asia , where there is still no ban on tobacco advertising or legislation to protect public health , are positively scandalous .
The proposed directive now being discussed mainly contains technical amendments to Community legislation on taxation of tobacco products .
In my opinion , sanctions should be imposed on Member States in future if they fail to adopt modern and effective surveillance systems without delay within the framework of the taxation system that has now been proposed .
But we know that the Commission proposal is already obsolete , and it is now absolutely vital to wait for the Commission to revise the basic directive , the packaging directive of 1994 , and incorporate its ideas and proposals for the marking of packaging accordingly .
Mr President , I should also like to congratulate Mr Donnelly , although , unfortunately , he is no longer as fully involved in the work of our committee as I would have hoped .
It is strange that the year 2000 computer problem should exist at all .
For years the experts have been trying to tackle the problem and now there are just a few months left .
I would like to ask the Commission , then , who is responsible in the case of Russia ?
My other question is what sort of problems are likely to be caused by troublemakers or out-and-out criminals if we reach the stage where there is some sort of state of confusion , and what does the Commission intend to do to avoid this kind of problem ?
Thirdly , I am pleased that the rapporteur mentioned the fact that we should be concerned about consumers and the SME sector , which face the greatest problems in these sorts of situations .
Mr President , it is not quite ten months to the turn of the century .
The European Parliament is quite rightly addressing the possible problems the year 2000 will cause , the so-called 'Y2K' problem .
It is well known , and it has been pointed out here , that in Russia and its immediate surroundings there is a lack of intellectual and material resources to solve the problem .
The issue is neither a political nor an ideological one , and in dealing with it borders must not act as barriers .
The EU must invest in finding a solution on a broad scale that transcends its own borders and that looks at the problem from the human angle .
The images of horror that have been painted by over-imaginative science-fiction writers , conjuring up apocalyptic visions , must not be allowed to come true .
Mr President , I should like to start by discussing the annual reports of the two health and safety committees .
Even so , they have succeeded in doing an excellent job .
Considerable progress has been made in this field .
Whereas in 1996 the Member States had transposed 74 % of the directives on health and safety at work into their national legislation , that figure has now risen to 95 % .
Enforcement is , however , what all the EU health and safety activities hinge on .
These are important priorities .
They will need every possible kind of support to achieve the levels that exist in the Community .
Finland 's good record in this area could be taken as a model of good practice for the other Member States .
There is a fundamental link here with employability .
Nevertheless , muscular-skeletal diseases and psycho-social factors currently constitute the greatest threats to workers ' health .
The Commission also states in its interim report that the increase in female employment brings with it certain special problems connected with health and safety at work .
Finally , I would like to say a word about the amendments .
I cannot approve Amendment No 1 , as it would reduce paragraph 3 of the report to a mere complaint about the small number of women on the committees and
