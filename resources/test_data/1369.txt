There are going to be new provisions for superstructures .
When is all this going to end ?
When are we going have realistic and sensible measures and the sort of technical committee structure that this Parliament asked you to introduce at first reading in 1997 and which is simply dismissed here ?
I quote in conclusion : " The Commission was unable to support the approach and in consequence did not amend its original proposal . "
Not a single word of explanation .
That is why my group will be recommending that this is rejected tomorrow .
Mr President , there is much in the text to promote access to buses by disabled people - passenger handrails , non-slip surfaces , standards for wheelchairs and a wide definition of reduced mobility to include all disabled people .
However , the key to tonight 's debate is Amendment No 8 : a guarantee of level access to all new buses in urban areas for persons with reduced mobility .
To achieve this requires a boarding aid , a lift or a ramp , because a low-floor bus on its own is not enough .
Our failure to agree this crucial part of the text would leave disabled people quite literally falling through the crack , a crack for which we would ourselves be responsible .
The rapporteur - to whom I offer my heartfelt thanks - has forged a compromise which seeks to share responsibility for access between bus manufacturers , operators , local planning and transport authorities .
But as we negotiate the final outcome I say to Parliament and the Commission that even a raised kerb at every bus stop can never be the full access solution .
Bad parking or obstacles on the pavement can still prevent boarding , whilst a simple manual swing-over ramp , built into the floor of each new bus , is cheap and will work time after time .
Yet nine years after this directive was first discussed , when the disability movement for a generation has put accessible public transport at the heart of its demands , those on the opposite side of the House threaten to vote , not simply against the amendment , but to destroy the whole directive .
Do they do so on grounds of cost ?
No.
The study of accessible buses commissioned by my own government shows low operating costs outweighing the marginal extra capital costs , while a 14 % increase in passengers brought in extra revenue .
Do they do so because of objections from manufacturers ?
No.
A check today , again in my own Member State , shows that British bus manufacturers and British bus operators are unanimous in their view that they want the directive to go through .
Do they do so because of a genuine difficulty at all ?
No.
Because the parliamentary committee that scrutinised these proposals in detail voted for them unanimously .
Mr President , my only conclusion , as we have heard tonight , is that those who oppose do so because they share the prejudice that disability access is an unnecessary technical detail .
They are wrong .
For a disabled person it means the freedom to travel or the restriction to stay at home .
Tonight we have the chance to grant that freedom to vote for accessible public transport .
We must and we will .
Mr President , as it is now after midnight , I say to you , Mr President and to you , Commissioner , happy Valentine 's day !
This is a very good report .
I say that without surprise as it is by Mrs Jensen , so of course it is a good report .
However , it was a slightly better report before the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs 'improved it ' .
Some of the amendments that have come through have not made it a better document .
I refer to just two aspects .
The first aspect - taking my life in my hands - refers to some of the amendments of the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities .
I strongly support women 's rights .
I strongly support the rights of young people , of old people , of disabled people and many other minorities .
But only the women have their own committee to speak up for them .
At times , perhaps , their voice drowns out some of the other groups , in my judgment .
I take as an example Article 3.1( 1 ) where the original text said : " To the maximum possible extent analysis will be gender-specific" .
I agree with that .
It should be gender-specific to the maximum possible extent .
But the Women 's Committee has taken out the words " to the maximum possible extent " .
Apparently "maximum possible " is not quite maximum enough .
I believe it was fine as it was .
I use that as an example , but I am still supportive of women 's rights .
I have my tomato-proof suit on just in case you were thinking of doing something .
The second point concerns the budget .
I believe the Committee on Budgets made a reference to the budget increasing from EUR 50 million to EUR 55 million , but on the basis that this should be proportionate to the implementation .
Last year 's budget was EUR 50 million .
Only two-thirds of that was spent ; 25 % of that was eaten up by administrative costs .
To go up from EUR 55 million to 65 million - which is the latest amendment - is , in my view , disproportionate .
It is a reflection of the enthusiasm of the committee for this particular project .
Sometimes it is all too common that in order to signify the importance of a subject more money is offered to it .
I should like to hope that ,
