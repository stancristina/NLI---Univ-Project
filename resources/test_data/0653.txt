the political initiatives taken by various States have greatly influenced the development of the positions of the main Heads of State , starting with George Bush himself .
Furthermore , my group would consider highly useful a further declaration by the Council and the Commission on the new strategic doctrine published by the Bush administration on 20 September .
This much is clear .
To do so , people everywhere , as widely as possible , must express their rejection of the US unilateral policy and it is time for the European Union to shoulder its responsibilities , and forcefully and vigorously restate its commitment to peace , the reason for its construction .
Fifthly , the main thing in this matter is to adhere to the UN rules on two counts .
We must not repeat the serious error that was made against international order in waging war against Yugoslavia without the backing of the Security Council .
The Iraqi Government agreed to this .
We must not accept the use of the Security Council as an instrument .
Al Qaida sleeper networks still remain in 52 countries .
On the contrary , it falls within the scope of Parliament 's commitment , recalled here by Mr Obiols , to establishing a privileged partnership with the Maghreb countries based on mutual respect and increased awareness of our common destiny .
I believe it is along the right lines for four main reasons .
Madam President , I say 'yes ' to strong links between Europe and Algeria .
Europe therefore has a responsibility .
This has to be said !
It must also be a political association .
They have the right to participate in European discussions .
Thirdly , the Presidency has reiterated that the Union attaches the utmost importance to respect for human rights .
Institutional legality in Côte d'Ivoire must be subject to wholehearted support from the international community .
In order to make further progress on these fronts , however , Côte d'Ivoire needs peace .
It is natural to support a politician for whom prison , exile and suffering have marked the thirty-year long struggle for his ideas .
The unprecedented economic crisis , related to the fall in the price of raw materials , and particularly of coffee and cotton , has caused further hardship and poverty in the country .
It is simply battling with a foreign invasion which , although it exploits the age-old oppositions between ethnic groups , as usual , is primarily a matter for geopolitical analysis .
The House and all of the Union institutions are concerned , not only by the serious and damaging internal consequences that the current crisis situation in Côte d'Ivoire may have , but also by the destabilisation - as several speakers have said - that the crisis could cause throughout the whole region if a peaceful political solution is not found in the very near future .
Given the progress made in discussions within the Council this very afternoon , I feel that we can say that an agreement on this proposal for a regulation is now within reach , and I am pleased to say that this has been made possible thanks to a very broad consensus between Parliament and the Commission , of which Mr Berend was one of the architects .
It is also for this reason that I proposed in the Commission 's first version to retain the quantitative threshold of EUR 1 billion .
European money must arrive quickly on the ground in order to assist victims at the time when they need it most .
That is why I shall , once again - and I would like to thank Commissioner Barnier for mentioning this - call for the creation of a European body for civil security .
I do not accept these compliments for myself alone .
Let us use this EUR one billion first , however , if we need to .
I therefore believe that we must take a look , in each of our countries , at best practice and the best schemes and perhaps exchange these best practices in the framework of intergovernmental cooperation .
Of course , we must also add to this the problem of our dependence on outside sources of energy supply .
A fruitful collaboration between professionals and scientists enabled them to determine quite early on that these species have slow life cycles and that there was an urgent need for catches to be limited so as not to endanger their biological balance .
Since this damage to a public asset is not spontaneously reflected in prices , the idea is to create a single market in rights to pollute which will be defined , quantified and sold by the public authorities .
I can say that he has done a lot to improve the system by extending the scope , making it obligatory and proposing complementarity with other environmental polices - public transport , renewable energy , charging , research , energy efficiency .
What will remain will therefore be : 'requests that the Commission carry out a regular assessment of the economic , social and environmental consequences of the implementation of the Association Agreement ' .
( Explanation of vote abbreviated in accordance with Rule 137( 1 ) of the Rules of Procedure )
And , when it does come up with something more tangible - 'to enable innovative enterprises to be set up ' - this announces assistance not for the victims of unemployment but for those responsible for it .
( FR ) In a country in which the use of 'ethnic prejudice ' has become the practice of all governments , from Konan Bédié to Robert Gueï and Laurent Gbagbo , a civil war would lead to disaster .
Initially , 70 amendments had been tabled since the vote in committee .
We therefore suggest postponing this debate until Thursday afternoon .
