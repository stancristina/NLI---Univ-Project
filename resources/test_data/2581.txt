being resolved .
Madam President , I think this move towards imposing environmental taxes throughout Europe is an important one .
Only through such a combination of forces and cooperation will it be at all possible to achieve results .
Besides , the fact that production methods which protect the environment and environmental taxes exist at all can be considered a competitive edge .
In my opinion , the whole of the EU , as a single market area , should aim to achieve a position whereby Europe 's competitive edge is the very fact that we have instruments available to us to control production and consumption so as to protect and improve the environment .
It will suit the market economy splendidly , because it fits in with that very principle , although we cannot merely rely on the market economy .
Whereas we may see changing the focal point of taxation as a means of achieving better environmental protection , at the same time it is evident that it is also a means of amassing the resources society needs to produce welfare services ; in other words , environmental taxes must be seen in the context of the overall tax system .
However , I would like to correct what my colleague Mr Liese said just now .
He in fact claimed that Mrs Myller wished to increase the tax burden on the Member States .
I understood that Mrs Myller said environmental and energy taxation would provide a way of lowering income tax , which is a very important issue .
But it must be said at the same time that it is one of the most acrimonious examples of how difficult it is at Union level to make any sort of headway .
Let us now turn our attention to the fact that the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party has produced an excellent draft amendment to Mr Ollson 's report .
We in Parliament can certainly hope that other Member States will unite in this effort .
The aims of Kyoto are going to remain unachieved unless the EU starts to draft a common energy taxation policy .
It would mean an increase in populism in the nomination process as well as the emergence of internationally well-known candidates , not necessarily politicians .
It was also important and in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity to establish that the setting of voting thresholds is voluntary .
As a part of creating more uniform conditions for the Members , it was important to establish that having any other parliamentary seat at the same time is incompatible with being a Member of the European Parliament .
Firstly , it was unfortunate that the majority of the House considered that constituencies should be compulsory in Member States with more than 20 million inhabitants .
Such a system could only serve to further confuse the electoral procedure .
The labour market has deflated to an average mass unemployment rate of over 20 % , while the capital market has inflated to a 40 to 50 % rise on the stock market .
Stock market prices have risen mainly in Italy , France and Finland .
It is spectacular proof of a lack of political alternative and satisfying the multifarious needs of profiteers .
The European Central Bank will not have any money then to bale out the speculators .
Mr President , the time has come to recall the promises the European Union made to its newest Member States , Austria , Finland and Sweden , when they joined the Union almost four years ago .
During this time , the EU intended to do all it could to raise its own environmental standards to the same level the newest Member States enjoyed .
The idea was that the whole European Union area would acquire a high level of environmental protection .
Actually , I am convinced that the citizens of Austria , Finland and Sweden will be watching very carefully to see whether the EU is actually capable of keeping to its promise of high standards for the protection of the environment and public health .
One of the most important derogations was the cadmium content limit in fertilizers .
There is often a lot of cadmium in the raw material that is used to make phosphate fertilizers , especially if it comes from certain countries in Africa .
On the other hand , in some regions , the cadmium content of the raw material for phosphate fertilizers is not so great .
Such regions include , for example , Finland and the Kola Peninsula in Russia .
In fact , there is reliable data coming from these newest Member States that limits for cadmium are very strongly justified from the point of view of health and the environment , though not enough information has been had from older Member States .
However , I am of the opinion that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy has accepted the view that the Commission and the Member States should be rather more determined in their purpose .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , what the rapporteur has said is true , that the cadmium contained in phosphate fertilizers , a poison that destroys microorganisms , has been found in Finland , Sweden and Austria , to be harmful to humans and the environment .
Cadmium must in future be classified as a harmful substance , and its limit values must be specified precisely in a new directive .
Producer countries , especially Morocco , must renounce their apathy and commit themselves to developing methods of ridding phosphate fertilizers of cadmium .
Community aid must continue to go particularly to producer countries in the African continent which are vitally important producers of the raw material for the EU internal market , and for whom the EU is the largest market in the world .
