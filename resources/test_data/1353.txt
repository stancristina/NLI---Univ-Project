These are the matters we need to engage with at EU level .
Even though there are naturally points of contact , they are two distinct policy areas requiring different approaches , and the two should be kept separate .
I wish to than Mrs Thyssen – hopefully , she will read the Minutes – for the far-sightedness and willingness to cooperate that she has shown .
Perhaps we really should have proceeded the other way round and first dealt with the major policy guidelines and then this programme , but what is done is done .
These two murders have exacerbated the situation .
A climate of fear also prevails .
In paragraph three , we state that we want international observers to monitor the murder investigation .
We are not using existing technology .
We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe support the Green Paper and find it extremely constructive , as , too , we do Mrs Kroes ’ work on the issue of competition .
That is a disgrace when we are at a stage at which , by siding with them , we can help the new Member States obtain stability where the supply of energy is concerned and at which we can solve major environmental problems .
It is a disgrace to put forward these arguments when we can also create so many jobs in Europe .
We cannot , however , afford to have such a situation in Europe any longer .
We have to do everything from ensuring that companies can grow together across borders to making sure that the internal market can operate both legally and technically .
Through common networks we can reduce our vulnerability and , at the same time , have the opportunity of obtaining access to safe and cheap electricity .
Such solidarity will then become a reality and not just a set of political objectives .
The report states that there is a gulf between members of the public and the European institutions , which is true , but the solution to this problem is not financial support for European parties .
Any democratic forces may , of course , form parties , but to act on the belief that , through the award of large grants , the public would be induced to accept the draft Constitution would not only be an attempt to obtain acceptance of the Constitution in return for money , but would also be very dubious in democratic terms .     The Member States face significant demographic challenges .
The current report contains a long list of exhortations regarding the type of measures the Member States should take within important areas such as social insurances , taxes , working times and immigration .
It is through such processes that European culture has developed and , in practice , conquered the world .
For a long time , the country has suffered great instability , which has led to famine , brutality towards civilians and a very serious situation in the whole of the Great Lake region .
It is up to each Member State to decide , at the request of the UN , whether or not troops are to be deployed .
It must be up to each party to lay down rules concerning the ways in which they wish to handle issues such as these .     We oppose the subsidised system now being developed for European political parties .
Parties must be constructed from the bottom up by the parties in the Member States .
We are therefore voting against this report .     We voted in favour of the report on demographic challenges and solidarity between the generations .
Nor do we support the European Parliament’s calling on the Member States and private companies to break the link between higher ages and higher wage levels .     The Swedish Conservatives have today chosen to abstain from voting in the vote on demographic challenges and solidarity between the generations .
We do not , however , believe that a transition to energy crops should be allowed to slow down the phasing-out of the common agricultural policy .
There is a lot more to be said in the debate about energy crops .
As is also apparent from the report we are debating , there are a couple of tasks in this connection in which the Commission has an especially important role .
I think , then , that the Commission must act vigorously and be unswervingly loyal in implementing the Treaty .
The last task is the one also discussed by Mr Evans , namely that of ensuring that we obtain a transatlantic competition policy that is reciprocal and that invigorates the whole of the transatlantic economy .
I am convinced that open meetings of the Council would increase the EU’s credibility , as well as people’s interest in the EU.
Formally , this legislation applies only to Parliament , the Council and the Commission , but it has , for all that , come to apply to many more bodies .
They can and must be .
That was why the Commission thought it better to wait for the Constitutional Treaty to be ratified before we did anything further .
The Constitution requires new legislation in this area .
The Commission thought that this was now an appropriate moment at which to begin overhauling the regulation , and the decision to do this is part of the broad European transparency initiative , which we in the Commission decided on in November of last year .
That is something we want to change , and we must do much more to reach out to people .
Without going into the details of the report’s various recommendations , I should simply like to clarify matters in a number of ways .
Our institutions had jointly decided to look
