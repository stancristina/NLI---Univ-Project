I know we should not do so , but there is that link between the two which makes me want to comment on both .
For the Commission proposals to be successful three factors will be crucial .
The first is the assessment of needs for the western Balkans .
In a couple of weeks ' time , Parliament will send an ad hoc delegation to Kosovo to try and make an assessment .
We will need to opt for the Commission proposal of EUR 5.5 billion in total or move towards the Council which is proposing a somewhat lower figure .
The second factor will be Parliament 's attitude to redeployment , especially in Category IV , not just for 2001 but for the whole of the Financial Perspective .
That is why I say they have to be linked .
I will give you an example .
One area of great interest for me - I make no secret of it - is South Africa .
The proposal to take EUR 2 million per year away from South Africa for six years may not seem much .
But EUR 12 million is a lot of money for the projects in South Africa .
I would not be happy with that and I am sure other people in other areas of interest in Category IV would adopt a similar attitude .
Then we have Parliament 's attitude towards redeployment in Category I. Similarly , we have to consider our approach to the use of the flexibility instrument if it was invoked for Serbia , as you suggest .
We have to bear in mind what the Interinstitutional Agreement says about a rule not being used for the same things in consecutive years .
Once again that would be a challenge for Parliament .
The third factor , and probably the most important one , is the attitude of the Council .
If they reject what you are proposing , especially as far as the revision goes , the question remains : what will you do next ?
I know we have a trialogue and a conciliation before their first reading but it is a problem we have to resolve before the Council 's first reading .
What happens if the Council is adamant and rejects the Commission 's proposals ?
Mrs Schreyer , you are something of a juggler and an illusionist at the same time , with the proposals that have been made .
You have to keep several balls in the air and , at the same time , because of what is proposed after 2003 , you have to make more appear .
One of the great mysteries in your proposals on the revision is where the money will come from after 2003 .
But that is not for next year .
That is for the future .
In the meantime we await developments on those three factors .
Hopefully , at the end of this process , we will get a satisfactory outcome .
Protecting the Communities ' financial interests and the fight against fraud .
Mr President , in the time available , I wish on behalf of the Economic Committee to stress three issues that we considered to be of cardinal importance when we examined the annual report on the Community 's financial interests and the fight against fraud .
First was the issue of definition .
It is the case that the Commission have come under a significant amount of attention in recent years from Parliament and from the European public at large who want the Commission to deal with allegations of fraud , but it is also important that we should know what we are talking about when we define fraud .
The annual report itself indicates that for the first time there has been an attempt made to try to assess what amounts to fraud and what is general irregularity , and I am of the view that it does not help the reputation of our European institutions if we are lax with definition .
It is important that the work being undertaken by the Commission should be expanded because , in a situation in which 20 % of irregularity amounts to fraud , the fact of the matter is that by referring to it as fraud and irregularity , European citizens can often be left with an impression that all of the claims are fraudulent ones .
The second point that I want to make is about the commitment of Member States to deal with fraud .
The fact of the matter is that Member States have a high responsibility here .
They are responsible for administering some 80 % of the EU 's budget and they must recognise that they are , at the very least , partners if not prime movers in attempting to address this important issue , and the report indicates that the performance of Member States has been mixed to say the least .
My final point concerns the accession countries .
We must demand that the accession countries also endeavour to work in conjunction with the European Union and to the highest standards .
Mr President , I also congratulate Mr BÃ¶sch on his report .
He is the acknowledged expert within the European Parliament and , to a large extent , was the architect of the new OLAF .
One thing that is certain to create a stir in terms of the EU is big stories about fraud .
They always get big coverage .
That is quite right too because any fraud is unacceptable .
The figure that is being attached to it is about 5 % of the EU budget .
But there are two important points to remember , which have been touched upon several times here today - and Mr Cunha has just raised them again .
