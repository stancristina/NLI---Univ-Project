taken in conjunction with Amendment No 7.
In Amendment No 6 I am seeking to replace that with Amendment No 10 which refers to the ISO standard and not to separate Member State standards which I had initially put in Amendment No 6 .
Amendment No 4 sets out in more detail the user groups that this report is trying to assist .
This list is , however , neither exhaustive nor prescriptive .
It was never intended to be and leaves plenty of scope for the inclusion of others .
Amendment No 8 opens up access to public transport to all those groups referred to in the aforementioned Amendment No 4 .
For the first time , we are making public transport accessible to all those people with reduced mobility .
This will be done by providing a kneeling system with either a lift or ramp but it also takes into account infrastructure improvements which have been carried out as well .
Maybe I should declare an interest at this point .
Just before Christmas my mother unexpectedly lost her sight .
As a son I obviously wish to help her , as I wish to help all visually impaired people within the European Union .
It is what I was elected to do and I am sure it is what the vast majority of people in this Parliament were elected to do .
These citizens are important users of public transport and they depend on us in the European Parliament to get it right .
We have that chance tomorrow by voting for those amendments .
I must , however , also mention Amendment No 9 which was submitted later by the PPE-DE Group .
When this came up at the Legal Affairs Committee it went through unanimously but then , all of a sudden , we heard that the PPE-DE Group wishes to reject the common position .
I am sorry and disappointed that their amendment rejects the common position .
That would set back accessibility for those citizens I mentioned earlier by several years .
I understand that one of the reasons that they are proposing rejection of the common position is because it will shackle the industry .
It will tie up the industry in red tape .
Can I ask those in the PPE-DE who are intending to speak on this how they would feel if they were shackled to a wheelchair or to sticks or to having to have a guide dog ?
That is shackling , not what we are trying to do with the industry .
I would be ashamed if their Amendment No 9 is carried .
I would be ashamed for every Member of this Parliament who puts their hand up or presses a button to vote for that amendment .
I therefore urge you to vote against Amendment No 9 but support the other amendments .
Mr President , it has been , as always , a pleasure to work with my friend Bill Miller on these technical directives and I believe that we will have made a significant improvement to this directive if it is approved .
So I will not go through the amendments .
He has done a good job on that .
I just want to address the question of why we on this side have chosen to propose a motion of rejection .
It relates to the whole issue of whether Parliament should be handling technical directives .
I recall that in a speech not long ago in this Parliament Commissioner Liikanen talked about some of the problems he is facing on potential pedestrian protection legislation for cars .
He presented us with at least 60 pages of complex technical mathematical calculations and he challenged us : is this the sort of thing this Parliament should be considering ?
This directive is 150 pages long and it has it own share of technical calculations , graphs , charts and other detailed technical provisions .
The same arguments apply .
I want to pick up on a point made by Bill Miller .
He is right to challenge us on the question about disabled access , but he said and I quote him , " It will make public transport accessible to all users " .
Regrettably that is not the case .
If it were , we would support it .
This piece of paper includes provision to make buses more accessible for disabled users , but it does not address the whole question of operating regulations for public transport systems across the European Union .
The issues which our colleague Mr Howitt quite rightly says we should be putting in here : changing the infrastructure to make buses more accessible for disabled users .
What have we actually achieved after nine years ?
Do we really have mutual recognition of technical standards between countries ?
Have we really achieved the sort of significant advances in safety that we want ?
I had a look through these 150 pages .
I may be wrong - Commissioner , you may be able to tell me this - but I could not find in here any provision for mandatory fitting of seat belts .
Why is that not in here if we are serious about the Council saying to us in this document that it has come up with a practicable solution with a high level of safety and user-friendliness .
If we really had achieved that , then we should be proud of it .
There are provisions , certainly , for things like strength of superstructure but the worrying thing here - and I ask the Commissioner to address this - is that this is not all .
At the end there is a list of things that the Commission and Council want to bring back to us .
It does not address school buses .
It does not address the latest developing technology of buses .
