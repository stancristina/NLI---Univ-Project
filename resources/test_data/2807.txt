The Italian government is responding to the immediate situation , taking important decisions and endeavouring to restore responsibility to local authorities , moving away from the system of sending in special commissioners and ensuring self-sufficiency in waste disposal .
This is not the moment for those who bear primary responsibility and are to blame for the entire policy to evade or deny it .
The fact that some European political groups , close to the Prodi government , have come out against a joint resolution on the health and environmental disaster in Campania which should have concluded our debate opens up another whodunit .
The government is taking steps to do so , but an effective solution will then need to be found and it will be vital for that solution to be based on European rules .
For that reason , today 's debate cannot be a platform for polemics , but an opportunity for dialogue with the Commissioner to promote such a relationship between Europe and the Member States .
For that reason , we ask , and I ask on behalf of the Committee , the Commissioner whether or not he considers that the Polish legislation on elections to the national parliament breaches Article 10 of the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities , which states that during the sessions of the European Parliament , its members shall enjoy the immunities accorded to members of their Parliament in the territory of their own State .
Finally , the Socialist group still believes that it would have been more appropriate , on a matter as sensitive as this , for the rapporteur to have withdrawn to a certain degree , in view of the events that saw him involved in politics in his country .
I also believe that we need to have some clarifications on data protection .
In any case , their fate is sealed : in the best-case scenario they will be condemned to poverty and social exclusion , while in the worst-case scenario they will be victims of organised crime .
All this involves an integrated approach to combining actions to achieve these goals .
To turn to my country , I must stress that we face a very strong wave of racism and stigmatisation , chiefly towards the Roma , particularly since Italy has not fully transposed Directive 43/2000/EC against ethnic discrimination .
It is a positive sign that Europe takes the issue seriously and aims for the kind of fair response that we have helped to flesh out .
In order to achieve this - and we must - there will be a need for considerable political will and the capacity to construct a complex scheme , but also consistency .
It is by this yardstick , the plight of Africa , that Europe 's contribution and dedication will be judged . on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I too , like all my colleagues , would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Ferber , on his work .
However , if other amendments should be approved we shall also vote in favour .
Specifically , and this is something I would like to emphasise , the issue of adaptation was discussed , even before 2012 , as also increased financing .
There was specific discussion of technology transfer , the issue of deforestation was included , but above all , and for me this is the most important and most promising issue , the barrier - hence the ' Berlin Wall ' - of Annex 1 was overcome between industrialised countries and developing countries in a world that has changed , in which a good number of those that were developing countries are now experiencing massive growth .
As you know , the Commission identified 26 strategic proposals for 2008 , and eight of these , so almost 30 % , concern the area of freedom , security and justice .
Then it is clear that the three requirements , on the one hand to work together with Parliament to assist this transition , and on the other not to slow down initiatives that are ready for action and on which there is consensus , and at the same time not to anticipate what the Treaty of Lisbon will say or do when it comes into force , must all be kept in mind .
We need to look to the future , we need to understand how we can manage the time left to us with a sense of responsibility and commitment shared by all the European institutions .
One in particular is that 18 months ' detention is not considered an improvement in the effectiveness of this directive , but an oppressive measure on which a good many in this Parliament will continue to express their displeasure . on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I much appreciated the willingness of the Commission and also of the Council to reach an interinstitutional political agreement quickly in view of the new transitions we will be experiencing in the next few months .
It seems to me that an objective assessment could quietly bring us to admit that it has not produced the effects that the vast majority of this Parliament and Europe 's citizens had hoped for .
As I said at the start , in the Council the idea of working to a timescale not limited to six months has proved a success .
Today we have an exercise under way .
We have already mentioned the assessment of Frontex .
I do not believe that we will have adopted the European PNR by the end of this year .
Finally again , asylum policy . 2008 will be decisive , since 2010 is the deadline for setting up a European asylum system . 2008 will
