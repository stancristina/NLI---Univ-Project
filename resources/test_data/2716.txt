The adoption of the new regulation is urgent , not only because the regulation which currently governs olive oil is old , but because there are serious problems which need to be tackled immediately .
I am puzzled at the fact that , while for products from the north the new regulations remain in force until 2005 , for olive oil the intention is for the regulation to remain in force only until 2001 , when there will be a new , more stringent , regulation .
In other words , we need to define an institutional framework which will allow the institutional problem to be solved on a predetermined basis and in a legally acceptable way , so that the problem of legal bases will not arise each time and cause the problems that it does .
I am of the opinion that , in the event that a solution is found to the short-term problem , we must also have the institutional solution in parallel .
Mr President , the adoption of an integrated European policy and a strategy for the viable development of towns and cities today takes on a certain urgency as , in many towns and cities , the downgrading of the natural environment , the problems of political , cultural and social exclusion , and the problems of crime and traffic chaos have brought about a serious deterioration of the lives of millions of people .
In my opinion , priority must be given to the following .
Fourth , we must give consideration to the needs of children , the elderly and people with special needs , during the planning of towns , buildings , roads and means of transport .
Eighth , we need to consider measures aimed at combating racism , xenophobia and at crime prevention , in other words , measures to safeguard the rights of the citizens of Europe to a life that is free from fear and insecurity .
Bearing in mind the significant role played in the economic and social life of the European Union by towns and cities and large urban centres , in which a very large part of the population lives and where more than two thirds of the wealth of the European Union is concentrated , I think that the Commission must promote a European urban strategy that will acknowledge the vital role of towns and cities , as well as the special problems they face , one which is also aimed at coordinating the various Community policies which may affect urban regions either directly or indirectly .
Given that the Community initiative "URBAN' , which for the most part has been extremely successful , is nearing its end without any possibility for its renewal , as with most Community initiatives , greater emphasis must be given to the innovative actions of Objective 10 of the European Regional Development Fund relating to the urban environment .
Secondly , special emphasis must be given to urban tourism , which could constitute the basis for growth for many regional towns and cities .
The urban environment is something akin to a biosphere for the vast majority of European citizens .
The citizens of Athens , for example , are very well aware of this .
It is about making a qualitative change , which I think will reduce arbitrariness and waste and will increase the overall gain of citizens from any Community intervention .
What is noteworthy and surprising in this ?
Three references suffice to support this assessment : the recommendation to abolish the provisions of the Treaty which concern freedom of association and the right to strike ; the elevation of social dialogue as the fundamental duty of trade unions , instead of the fight for workers ' rights ; the adaptation of the policy of employment to the objectives of EMU.
The labour movement 's rights are currently under attack as never before and the European Parliament should be concerning itself with assisting it in its struggle , instead of taking a hand in the attempt to undermine it .
The Commission communication is undoubtedly a significant piece of work , which brings to the forefront the important topical issue of the promotion of voluntary organizations and foundations .
I believe that it must be regarded in this way , as a point of contact with the society of citizens and an activation , a recognition , of the role that it can play .
You have brought us to a problematic impasse : either we will stay for the vote or , bearing in mind that it should begin at 11.00 a.m. , we have arranged a flight for a particular time .
Mr President , I would like to talk about the crux of the matter , which is neither political refugees nor family reunification .
Of course , the immigrants themselves , who see in the European Union the lost paradise , the paradise that they cannot find in their own countries , are not to blame .
Let us stop burying our heads in the sand .
In particular , the impact on female employment must be stressed , given that the sector is dominated by women doing highly intensive work .
The European Union bears the gravest of responsibilities , because it has not taken care to protect European production , even at the most elementary level , from unfair competition on the part of countries that practice social dumping .
The new committee will be a kind of technical adviser with as broad-based a composition as possible .
I do not think that much needs to be said and I think that we must not overstate its role .
I do not think , therefore , that we need be overly concerned about this , and the composition of the Economic and Financial Committee must be as before :
