term , I would like my draft legislative resolution to be put to the vote also .     Mr President , I would like to refer to what happened with the Schmidt report during the previous sitting : it does not make any sense at all to refer the report back to the committee .
The enlargement of the Union on 1 May 2004 will result in an increase in the EIB 's lending capacity without raising the ceiling on its external lending mandate , which will be particularly favourable at a time when the European Union is stepping up its cooperation with potential candidate countries in the Western Balkans and is preparing to gradually strengthen its links with other neighbours to the south and east .
It should , however , be stressed that the committee is not ruling out a study at a later stage , for 2008 , on the applicability of satellite technology , but everything will depend on technological progress in the market and on the specific needs of other types of road traffic control .
The proposal provides for a set of measures aimed at increasing security in the international movement of goods .
The institutional synergy between the Community and Eurocontrol will bring certain benefits in terms of air traffic capacity , safety and efficiency , to be achieved by initiating programmes for developing and implementing new air traffic control technologies .
As ever , attempts are being made to move forward in ways and at a pace with which we cannot agree .     This proposal relates to the accession of the European Community to the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation , Eurocontrol .
Although I wish to congratulate the Commission on its initiative , I must disagree with certain points , points that the rapporteur has also challenged and addressed in her report .
In particular , it advocates that restrictions relating to ‘transfrontier workers ’ should not be lifted , and proposes that a specific visa intended for them should be created .
The proposal emphasises that ‘as a development of the Early Warning System , the network is primarily designed to facilitate the exchange of strategic and tactical information on irregular or illegal migratory flows and trends ’ .
I wish to emphasise the possibility of Europol being included in this network .
The measures proposed will also make it possible to eliminate some existing problems that are the result of the far-reaching changes that have taken place since 1977 .
The rapporteur eventually presented an amendment to this effect , which was quickly replaced by a corresponding correction .
What is required is the swift and effective sharing of information in the fields of border controls and police cooperation .
The VIS is proposed as a system for the exchange of Visa data between Member States .
The initiative seeks to transmit to the USA personal data which , according to the information made available , would cover thirty-four areas , including telephone numbers , credit card details , political opinions , family background , religious beliefs and health .
Police cooperation is essential if we are to provide the European public with a higher level of safety within the area of freedom , security and justice .
At this stage , it is preferable to retain the network structure of national institutes , but now with a legal personality , a governing board responsible for organising and running the College , and its own secretariat and seat .     .
The rapporteur tabled three amendments in order to restore some logic to the proposals , as regards costs borne by the CEPOL budget and the location of the seat of CEPOL.
In this area too we are seeing the consolidation of a cabinet consisting of the larger members , while smaller countries such as Portugal are excluded from decision-making at the heart of EU monetary policy .
Impact assessment , as stated , incidentally , in the institutional agreement on better lawmaking of June 2003 , is an essential tool , not only in terms of improving the quality of legislation , but also in terms of reducing the financial and administrative burden incurred in complying with legislation .
People with disabilities are still , however , not accorded equal treatment and opportunities in all aspects of life .
I welcome this report , although it falls short in certain areas .
I congratulate Mr Mantovani on his excellent and timely report on the Communication from the Commission on Equal Opportunities for people with disabilities : A European Action Plan .
I therefore applaud the Commission ’s initiative to propose the adoption of a European Action Plan in this area .
It calls for non-discrimination and the promotion of human rights to be the main focus of the European Union’s strategy .
It advocates the use of the European Social Fund and Structural Funds for persons with disabilities .
I therefore voted in favour of this recommendation for a second reading regarding the Common Position adopted by the Council .
The current regulation on the matter is over 30 years old and has undergone numerous modifications , as a result of national systems being updated and of rulings by the European Court of Justice .
It is regrettable , however , that the Council has not gone further as regards two aspects .
The principles of equal working conditions and of exported benefits are both strengthened .
I therefore support the final Common Position .     .
The main objective remains the same and a higher level of safety in Trans-European tunnels will be ensured .
Without prejudice to the special emphasis placed on monitoring air quality , which is , of course , to be welcomed , I agree with the rapporteur’s criticisms of the absence of limit values in this proposal (unlike other directives in this field ) .
