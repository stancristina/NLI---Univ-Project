On this basis , we have focused our attention on certain key points , which I will just mention : transparency and shareholders ’ rights , role of institutional investors , promotion of the role of independent directors , the specific issue of corporate pyramids , rights of workers as particularly qualified creditors of the company and the centrality of a system of public oversight of audits .     Madam President , Commissioner De Palacio , Mr Mombaur , Mr Seppänen , last June the European Union adopted , with difficulty and well behind time in relation to consumers ’ and European companies ’ needs , Directive 2003/55/EC which takes decisive steps towards the completion of the liberalisation of the gas market .
Also highlighted was the need , in any case , to create a system of tariffs tallying with transport infrastructure use ; the need to establish homogenous mechanisms for calculating the costs of each mode of transport and clearly comparing the Member States ; and , finally , the need , to equip governments with transport policy instruments based on infrastructure costs so as to encourage the use of transport modes with less environmental impact and , above all , to allow for new investments in infrastructure and , in future , to complete the plan for fully implementing the major infrastructure projects for the trans-European transport networks that are also suffering from problems of financial cover .
Today , however , the new approach to the sphere of public sector activity , the ceilings on the Member States’ budgets and policies for the privatisation of services , make it essential also to have recourse to private-sector capital to finance the construction of infrastructures , even if it means sacrificing a plan for completion .
We can say that the excellent Cocilovo report does , at least , allow us to achieve the first objective of sensibly applying the principle according to which those using the roads are charged the cost of them and this money is used to finance maintenance or further construction and , therefore , indirectly , to thus take a broad approach that , by using cross-financing , allows us to take a more comprehensive look at the corridor in which the road runs .
Let us not forget that the text that will emerge from this House today is a text that strongly reflects the contribution made by the European Parliament and its amendments .
That being said , we still have to take a further step on this issue .
Could the Commission , though , let us know how this control of the application of these minimum standards takes place and to what extent counter-measures are being adopted where these minimum standards are not being observed ?     Mr President , first of all , I would like to thank Mr van Hulten – even if he is not present – not just for his five years in Parliament but also because , at the beginning , I did not believe in his policy of adding into the discharge report a whole raft of considerations that went a little further than his mandate allowed but which , in light of the inertia of governments and also , let us be truthful , our inertia , were in fact welcome .
In fact , whilst Article 7 of the Directive gives Member States the power to control the processing of personal data for security reasons , the Community takes this competence away from Member States in the draft agreement to give it to a foreign authority .
It is therefore necessary that the agreement text is changed and that , in any case , recourse is made to the Court of Justice to obtain an opinion .     Commissioner Patten , I believe that the real reason why the European Union finds itself in a weak position is because we have waived our own rules .
The rules cannot be reformed and reforms are not carried out when there is no respect for the procedure .     Mr President , I take the floor to talk about Articles 3 , 28 , 64 , 118 , 151 , 171 and 172 , on access to documents .
We discussed matters impartially yet a majority in the Committee on Freedoms want to be obstructionist – that really is obstructionism –and somehow consider just the political aspect of the situation .
The document that we are discussing has , in fact , been hijacked by a hidden agenda – depriving the cultural , scientific and technical research that the title announces of any value – even though the fact that the title itself picks out Italy as a country in which freedom of information is allegedly under greater threat than elsewhere , gives an early indication of biased conclusions that are simply meant to hurt the Italian Government and particularly its Prime Minister .
The rapporteur has indeed proposed a few cosmetic touches – as she describes them – as a gesture of willingness .
It is a shame , because one just cannot see where the truth lies .
With its analyses and proposals , this work will be of great significance for the future of the enlarged Community of 25 Member States .
The report also examines the risks of violation of freedom of expression and information , particularly in Italy , as specified in the mandate given to the committee .
It is not wrong to state that there is still freedom of expression in my country , but the space for freedom of information has been greatly restricted .
They want to prevent it from being discussed in this House so as not to indict an information system designed to produce only approval for the person who owns or controls it .
In a Europe that is becoming more and more neoliberalistic and antidemocratic , where the power of the
