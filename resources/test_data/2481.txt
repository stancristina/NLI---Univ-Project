What matters today is to provide the widest possible access to education and continuous updating of knowledge .
Mr President , I should like to compliment both rapporteurs - both our colleagues have done a good job - and to make one preliminary remark .
I think it is appropriate to point out that the House is now discussing for the umpteenth time matters related to the somewhat new institutional exercise of fighting for lawfulness , in other words against crime .
A range of measures therefore exists ; we need only think of corruption .
We heard from Rita Borsellino , the sister of Judge Borsellino , whose commitment testifies to the importance - not only for the sake of her brother 's memory , but in order to combat the mafia - of a struggle based on a deep commitment by society to conveying the message of lawfulness .
At the same time , I took on board the views of all those - individuals or groups - who approached me either in person or in writing with particular comments and considerations .
My first remark is that the directive contains proposals relating to the conduct of clinical trials of medicinal products on human subjects and the implementation of GCP.
Thirdly , the technical aspects of the proposed directive must be harmonised with documents already issued or currently being drawn up , and in particular those relating to the ICH , those on GCP and those on pharmacovigilance .
It is to be hoped that Parliament will manage to provide the democratic impetus to persuade the Commission and Council to lay down a single clear-cut rule for all the Member States .
The good clinical practice guide has existed since 1990 , but as we all know is not binding ; that is why national provisions must be harmonised .
In this way , we shall ensure that trials are completely safe .
I believe that your report refers to external staff as one tangible problem .
The Member States should be called on , in more general terms , to overhaul their educational systems thoroughly .
Investment of a purely social nature would be ineffectual .
A reduction in labour costs , naturally , and of course increased entrepreneurship , above all among SMEs .
I believe that it is worth underlining the social relevance of the institutions which are being established .
Since Article 188c of the Treaty deals with precisely these matters , it should be included in the report .
Thus , because of the steadily increasing significance of the social dialogue , I should like to touch on three matters which crop up in the Commission 's communication and are also referred to in Mr Peter 's report .
Indeed , ever since the Fontainebleau summit the vertical sectoral approach - that is , specific directives - for specific jobs and occupations has been replaced by a horizontal approach , in other words the general system based on semi-automatic recognition of qualifications without prior harmonisation of education and training systems .
New and different facts would be required in order for it to be reopened , but that is not the situation at present .
The Commission 's very well-structured Green Paper addresses this question - and it does so in a responsible fashion , as do we in the European Parliament , in these times of widespread crisis when the two most crucial and worrying issues of all are the economic future of pensioners and jobs for young people .
One key point in the background is of course the sustainability of the euro , which in fact changes the frame of reference for pension funds and for supplementary pension schemes in general ; in many senses , it certainly facilitates investment and cross-border mobility of workers .
I took the liberty of putting forward a framework , a sort of chart with various pointers .
From a somewhat broader point of view , I would say that the aerospace industry has emerged from the morass of a year or so ago , thanks to a number of agreements , but that so far it has only been partially restructured .
But all the members of the delegation and all the political groups faced up to it with intelligence , persistence and great determination .
If this is the political challenge our credibility will be riding on in the years ahead , our institutions are certainly not ready to face up to it .
Madam President , the reports on 'Agenda 2000' that the various committees are presenting hang together like spider 's web.
To be complete , the construction of Europe must unite all its peoples .
But we must point out , with some regret , that the institutional reforms , the future financing of the budget and other problems are still waiting in the wings , while there is a need for unambiguous political will on the part of all the governments to handle European affairs politically and not as a purely economic and financial negotiation .
The most important of these would be reducing the fiscal pressure on small companies and raising employees ' wages through profit-sharing schemes , practical measures which should certainly be accompanied by initiatives to define the future of social dialogue precisely , and promote the adoption of a charter of fundamental social rights , also extending it to those partner countries which have not yet ratified it .
We have also considered the possibility of establishing mixed companies involving third countries , taking maximum advantage of NGOs and small-scale fishing .
That is a contradiction in terms .
We are not asking for greater allocation of resources to regions in this group , only Structural Fund intervention for the whole of the programming period .
Those objectives can be summarised as the development of proactive labour market policies , the promotion of social inclusion , the
