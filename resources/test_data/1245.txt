I would congratulate Mrs Gebhardt on a good piece of work .
Madam President , allow me , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , to begin by congratulating the rapporteurs and all those who have contributed to the Convention .
This has become additionally clear in the course of last year .
Naturally , political compromises have also been made .
At the Nice Summit , the Charter will be accepted in the form of a political declaration .
As soon as possible after the Summit , the Swedish Presidency must also establish the procedures for working on the Charter ' s continued status , the objective being that , following certain changes , it should become binding and part of a future European constitution .
That right does not exist in other international documents , and it is absent from the constitutions of many Member States .
The method of working has been a success .
The two belong together .
I believe he has contributed to the clarity to which Mrs Berès referred in this Chamber .
Ultimately , the debate is about whether the EU is to be founded upon normal constitutional principles .
There are no respectable arguments for opposing this particular requirement .
How , otherwise , will a legal area of 500 million people be able to operate ?
The Charter constitutes a balanced and solid basis for enlargement .
For those who feel the need to do so , I recommend reading the explanations in Convention 49 and also studying that case law from both courts which is bound up with the Treaty .
Attaque notes that the Charter involves a step backwards in relation to the Member States ' , the UN' s , the Council of Europe ' s and the ILO ' s rules already in force .
- ( SV ) Chapter VII ( General Provisions ) , Article 51( 2 ) of the draft Charter of Fundamental Rights states , ' This Charter does not establish any new power or task for the Community or the Union , or modify powers and tasks defined by the Treaties ' .
It is in danger of undermining the Council of Europe ' s work on human rights and of leading to a situation in which human rights are dealt with in different ways in European countries in the future .
We believe that the draft Charter is a bad product which ought not to be taken any further .
It therefore also lacks any real significance in terms of people ' s rights .
I am voting against this Charter because I do not want it at all .
Mr President , if Turkey were a member of the EU , it would be the most populous Member State after Germany .
The Commission ' s latest report on enlargement confirms that progress has been made but also highlights large deficits in terms of democracy , human rights and the treatment of ethnic minorities such as the Kurds .
Turkey has not come so far as had been hoped .
My role here is to represent the members of the Group of the Party of European Socialists in the Committee on Budgets .
Mr Seppänen' s report is about increasing the European Investment Bank ' s powers and mandate to take action in Turkey .
That is why the demands for democracy and human rights must also find expression in the EIB ' s financing activity .
This is a consultation procedure , but it would be reasonable , of course , for it to be a codecision procedure because these decisions can in actual fact lead to the Budget 's having to be adjusted .
We are increasing the Investment Bank ' s commitments , but we are not increasing the EU Budget ' s loan guarantee reserve to the same degree , and we have undertaken to provide 65 % finance if a loan cannot be repaid .
If we shall nonetheless be voting in favour of the proposal , it is because we think it important to contribute to more positive development in those areas where Turkey is still falling down , especially the economic area .
I should particularly like to address Mr Verheugen , as the Commissioner with responsibility for enlargement , and also the French Presidency .
The EU' s four freedoms cannot be applied to the whole of Cyprus following the partition .
Previous speakers referred to the genocide in Armenia .
Is it 10 , 50 or perhaps 100 countries ?
According to the latest information I have , it is 127 countries .
It makes no great difference whether she has transgressed voluntarily or against her will , that is to say been raped .
Moreover , is 'activity in professional , political or social spheres ' , to quote the justification , the highest good and only thing of value for individual human beings ?
Mr President , a while ago , I received a serious meniscus injury .
Can I not be admitted as an emergency patient ? '
I am rather ashamed to admit it , but I chose that solution .
It is , of course , the same doctor , the same nurses , the same hospitals and the same resources in the health care sector which are to be used , irrespective of whether it is ordinary or private patients who are being treated .
My group believes that this class-determined type of organisation must be objected to .
Madam President , France ' s ban on animal meal in feedingstuffs came far too late .
In this situation , the only way to break the cycle of BSE infection is to place a complete ban on the use of animal meal as feed .
We only just managed to obtain such an opt-out , but we managed it , even
