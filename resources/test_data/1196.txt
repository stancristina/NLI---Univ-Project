think about a good negotiating strategy now .
Then , of course , we also have the European elections .
The proposals to include the sector in the greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme , the agreement with the United States and the reform of landing rights are a few examples .
However , it does not seem to me desirable that the Commission , with such a plan in hand , should force the Member States to take certain steps or indeed stand in their way .
We support the rapporteurs ' proposal because it is closer to a fair distribution than previous proposals .
In that case the risks are still more or less equal .
At the moment that is lacking , as can be seen from the products intended for consumption we regularly come across that do not meet the standard , even in the European Parliament . on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . - ( NL ) Mr President , in the past few months my fellow Members and I have met a great many representatives of the motor industry .
We have to do that , for ourselves and for future generations .
It gives the European Parliament and national parliaments more influence , enabling European citizens to exert more direct influence on policy .
It is really high time the European Union returned to the issue of tobacco , as silence has surrounded the subject for too long .
Of course , ample experience of this kind of smoking ban has been gained already in countries such as Ireland , Scotland and Italy , and this experience is actually all positive .
The Florenz report also looks towards the revision of this Directive .
We also describe what has come of the commitment that Turkey entered into .
When I look at Turkey and Armenia , that means that the borders must be opened .
On the one hand we realise , we know , that any country where fifty people have been killed in the last month has to do something in response , while at the same time many of us realise - including , I think , many in the Turkish Government - that large-scale military operations are no solution .
For these reasons we , my Group and I , have always supported the strategic partnership with Russia .
That is why it is so important that we press the issue of observers in Moscow : not only observers on the actual election day , but also observers during the campaign in the run-up to the elections .
While this groundless optimism in paragraph 8 is maintained , my Group is withdrawing its support for this report .
In our view that strategy had two important shortcomings .
The economic partnership agreements being negotiated at the moment could be a good instrument for this , provided - and I stress this point - they have sustainable development at their core and provided they are more than just European trade agreements .
As far as European policy areas are concerned , the report draws attention to the importance of greater coherence between development activities on the one hand and other policy areas on the other hand , such as trade , agriculture and migration .
Only if Europe can make more coherent , better coordinated use of its support and improve its financial accounting can the development policy of the European Union become more effective and more efficient .
The Joint EU-Africa Strategy and the Action Plan will be decided on there .
The fact that this summit is taking place is extremely important , and not only for negative reasons , not only out of an anxious reaction to the growing influence of China .
Mr President , the work programme presented here shows exactly how easily official Europe bandies about the crucial term 'subsidiarity ' . The Commission thus assumes , entirely in keeping with Mr Frattini 's earlier initiatives , definitive jurisdiction over the legal aspect of labour migration , whereas in my view it is solely the remit of the Member States .
Mr Barroso himself came to the Netherlands earlier this year to tell the Dutch that that is quite enough now , that they had better not worry about a referendum and that it is high time for them to accept the principles of the European Constitution .
Priority must be given to this matter .
There is nothing concrete in the proposals for the coming year , and it is therefore not clear what the intercultural dialogue will be , but I fear that it might be the annual photograph of Mr Barroso with the generally conservative ecclesiastical leaders .
What will the Commission do in terms of the Central Asia strategy that was recently approved by the European Council ?
I am in complete agreement with the Minister and the Presidency , who are indeed dismantling the last remains of the Iron Curtain .
Schengen of course relates to much more than border controls .
Naturally a solution is also necessary for the people of Cyprus themselves .
There is therefore a great deal of free movement of people within the European Union even without the application of the Schengen acquis .
I would very much like to look at disaster control and disaster prevention in a broader context , namely climate change .
We have a very good Fund , a very good example , but the European Council still has reservations about it .
To begin with I must thank Satu Hassi most warmly for all the important work she has done to arrive at the resolution now before us .
The ball is now in Ukraine 's court .
Europe will not succeed in combating the increasing poverty and global warming - the major challenges of globalisation - if it constantly puts the emphasis on liberalisation .
