We retained the allocations proposed for expenditure relating also to rural development and accession measures which were in the preliminary draft budget .
We decided , with regard to construction programmes , to reduce advance payments of commitments with regard to the new construction programmes by 3.5 %in the year 2000 instead of 4 % as suggested in the preliminary draft budget , which means that the payments would be reduced by EUR 1,023 million .
This reduction is necessary in limiting the growth of payments to 2.8 % as opposed to the Commission ' s recommended 4.7 % .
As regards construction work , we also take into account the request put forward by the European Parliament during the Agenda 2000 negotiations and we decided to create a new point in the budget for Community urban initiatives .
In discussing the expenditure associated with internal policies , we stressed that it is important to stick to those principles which form part of the discipline of the budget for the new agreement between official bodies , and part of the improvement of the budget procedure .
As regards the strategy promoting the accession of new Member States , we have reduced the payments by EUR 121 million .
In accordance with the view of the Council , the resources to be directed towards aid and rebuilding work in Kosovo are definitely to take priority in the draft budget .
In the view of the Council , they may be taken from the maximum grants of the new financial framework relating to expenditure connected with external actions by redeploying those funds .
This provision was made by reducing the usual grants which the Commission had allotted to other points of the budget in its preliminary draft for other external actions .
In the course of time these figures may even prove to be overestimates .
We approved the budget structure for the expenditure in question and your proposal relating to the nomenclature .
This is a reduction of EUR 4.5 billion or 4.7 % in comparison with 1999 .
Payments total 87.9 billion , which is an increase of EUR 2.3 billion or 2.8 % in comparison to the budget for 1999 .
Thirdly , the upper limits for external actions and internal policies leave latitude to the tune of EUR 222 million and EUR 22.5 million below the maximum sums of the Financial Perspective .
I also look forward with interest to a continuation of co-operation with both rapporteurs responsible for the fiscal year 2000 , Jean-Louis Bourlanges and Ky√∂sti Virrankoski .
For this reason I hope that both budgetary powers will stick to the these issues for which a consensus was reached in the unofficial trialogue held last week , and that supplementary budget 4/99 can be approved as it is without amendments or delays arising from any amendments .
At the same time I want to thank Commissioner Liikanen especially for his valuable co-operation .
Your work with Parliament has been transparent , decent and honest .
The combined budget for these institutions is EUR 1,288 million .
The budget of the European Parliament does exceed the share agreed by Parliament itself in accordance with the gentleman' s agreement , which is 20 % of category 5 , because it currently stands at 20.3 % .
In the staffing policy of the official bodies , great moderation has been observed , which meant that staff increases were less than in the previous five-year period .
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs as well as the Committee on Regional Policy increased their staff by ten people .
This has been achieved by employing a deliberate staff policy and by redeployment of tasks .
Now a change is threatening this development , in which the EU is attempting to save taxpayers ' money .
If the European Parliament attempts to increase its own staff considerably , this is a clear signal to other institutions .
Now it must be decided what kind of disciplined staffing policy the European Parliament wishes to follow , because it has quite a lot of authority in this matter .
Put concisely , Parliament directs money to official bodies for administration as a lump sum , and each official body can itself decide on the basis of its own unique organisation about the salary grades to be imposed and increases in those grades .
I support this idea fully .
It is not particularly sensible that the Committee on Budgetary Control and the President of the Council discuss the establishment of one C-grade when there are 1,776 C-grades in Parliament .
It emphasises the need for personal responsibility as well as economic responsibility at lower levels of the official machinery .
It is incongruous and objectionable that the EU needs longer payment times than Member States or enterprises whose budgets can be many times the size of the EU budget when compared .
These issues must be clearly borne in mind when staffing legislation is reformed in the next few years .
Therefore , and for this reason , it is possible to strongly agree with the Council ' s demand that the Commission must set about preparing new regulations on staffing .
In the first place , and as I said in my own speech , my view is that the question of providing the necessary finances for Kosovo will surely come to be one of the most central and dominant elements of the autumn budgetary process .
In accordance with this view , most of the allocations belonging to category 4 have grown in comparison to the budget of the past year , and on the other hand , there are also points under category 4 to which no cuts at all have been applied .
I have stated on many earlier occasions that we have to expect consistent estimates of the requirements concerning the rebuilding of Kosovo .
Up to now the results of the estimates
