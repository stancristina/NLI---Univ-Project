Moreover , following the same context of the Treaty of Lisbon , Parliament 's Committee on Petitions should forge closer working links with similar committees in Member States ' national and regional parliaments in order to promote mutual understanding of petitions on European issues and to ensure the swiftest response to members of the public at the most appropriate level .
However , not everything was going to be positive .
Mr President , on behalf of my group , I would also like to join in congratulating and thanking Mr Iturgaiz .
Nevertheless , regarding everything relating to EU competences , such as management of the ecosystem , the environment , etc. , we would need to make the Commission 's responses relating to this procedure much faster , including the warning letters to Member States .
I believe that the public will thank us if we can speed up and simplify the Commission 's actions , as well as making them have much more effect when there are breaches of environmental regulations .
The following comments that have been made are totally justified : there is a lack of information , and it is true that certain petitions have been paralysed and were not completed .
These have been the two main objectives .
Ladies and gentlemen , I told you that , without a doubt , the economy - the economic crisis and the desire to put in place a common economic policy and greater economic union - had been a fundamental objective of the European Presidency .
Alongside this , we have consolidated a new framework for the Stability and Growth Pact during this period , the details of which have still to be worked out .
In short , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there have been substantial advances with regard to economic union .
However , it is a treaty that requires great political will from all 27 Member States .
Alongside this , our Presidency has given its active backing to the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy , who has taken part with the Commission and the Council in the preparations for a number of summits during this period - with Russia , Japan , Pakistan , Canada , Morocco , Latin America and the Caribbean .
I would emphasise that , under our Presidency , cooperation policy was discussed in the European Council for the first time during a specific debate within this august institution .
We have taken steps towards launching the citizens ' initiative , as is well known ; its implementation , through negotiations that need to be held with this House , will be a major commitment with regard to citizens ' participation in the process of European integration .
We have been committed to , and worked towards , strengthening the impact and presence of Europe in the world , convinced as we are that this project has greater strength and greater vitality than when it started , with such enthusiasm and such great scope for Europeans .
These general strikes are responses by workers and pensioners to this economic orientation agreed by you and by a substantial majority of this Chamber .
This policy of not intervening in the economy has led us into an unprecedented crisis within the European Union , and has placed the European social model in jeopardy .
General strikes .
( Applause ) There was another speaker who also seemed to me to have this tendency to feel like he shared the responsibilities of colleagues in the Spanish Parliament , or to be intent on getting involved with what they are doing ; of lending his political and ideological colleagues a hand .
I can say with satisfaction that the Spanish Presidency has received nothing but support and recognition for its constructive attitude from the Commission , from the Council and from the European Parliament , and I am glad that not a single criticism of the attitude towards the major institutions has been expressed today .
However , if the objective was , as expressed by the Spanish Presidency , greater union in terms of economic policy , this has been achieved beyond expectations .
Let us move on to another consideration , and an analysis of the macro-economic situation of countries , including competitiveness .
If we decided to move , together with the Commission , towards economic union that is much more solid , stronger and with more common economic policies , we have also done this .
The Spanish Presidency , through its drive , or through the hard work of its officials , Spanish officials , contributed to all of these and this must be acknowledged in all cases , although there will be some who do not want to acknowledge the political aspects of this , that politicians should encourage and give credit to these officials .
We will work and do whatever is in our power .
We have felt understood by you , encouraged by you .
I am opposed to fortress Europe , which uses migrants as cheap labour without job security or rights , and also to current repressive EU immigration policy .
Mr President , the financial supervision package is one of the most important legislative measures that has come before the European Parliament , and is a decisive step towards improving the economic governance of the European Union .
There has been very significant progress on fundamental issues which are already important bases for the agreement : the definition of objectives ; consumer protection ; the role of the authorities within the regulatory process ; the checking of compliance with legal standards ; the establishment of binding mediation ; the temporary banning of products ; the introduction of the notion of systemic risk and the strengthening of supervision relating to it ; the development of the concept of the 'stakeholder ' ; proper use of the
