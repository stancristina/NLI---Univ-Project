medically assisted suicides and also enables children of sixteen years and over to decide for themselves , without their parents ' permission , whether or not they wish to be present .
This is obviously an important issue that Mr Sacrédeus is addressing , and one affecting our values .
The Council assumes that the honourable Member is referring to the Total Allowable Catch and quotas adopted by the Council in December 2000 .
The Member States ' catch allocations are divided up on the basis of the International Marine Research Council ' s administrative divisions with a view to complying with the principle of relative stability laid down in the aforesaid Regulation and in the accession document of 1985 .
Article 349 of the accession document restricts Portugal ' s access to the Southern stock of hake .
Reports from professional fishermen also have an important role to play in assessments .
The formal response must be the one I have just given .
Allow me to remind you that I had the opportunity to report on the Swedish Presidency ' s priorities where fisheries are concerned in my reply to the question put during the European Parliament ' s January part-session .
On the other hand , it is also of limited scope because the common fisheries policy ought to include farther reaching considerations than the interests of fishermen and the fishing industry here and now .
A programme of measures to promote biological diversity in the fishing industry was expected to be available from 28 March , that is to say last week .
Following the Council meeting in December 2000 , work has progressed on establishing recovery plans for cod and hake in Community waters .
It will also shortly be adopting a further amendment to the regulation concerning certain technical measures designed to conserve fish stocks .
The Council is naturally fully aware of the appalling and deeply alarming consequences of climate change , as described in the Third Assessment Report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , to which the honourable Member also refers .
Of special importance in this connection is the work being done within the Commission on , for example , the European Climate Change Programme and the work based on the green paper on greenhouse gas emissions trading within the European Union .
Moreover , the President-in-Office of the Council ( Environment ) , the Swedish Minister for the Environment , together with the Commissioner with responsibility for environmental issues , Mrs Wallström , have visited Washington during the last few days in order to express the European Union ' s concern directly to the American government and to discuss how the American government might be persuaded to resume discussions of the Kyoto Protocol .
Mr President , allow me first of all to thank the rapporteur for an excellent piece of work .
A not insignificant proportion of the amendments adopted by the Committee come from the PPE-DE Group , and these have strengthened the position of passengers .
When the revised Regulation comes into force , European air passengers will be given significantly better protection .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in the general debate I often hear that it was the farmers who fed their cows other , dead cows .
We have inherited a chain with many links and with large gaps between each link and the next .
Farmers therefore need significantly more transparency and significantly more precise information .
Mr President , we are looking just now towards China in the hope that the incident involving the American aircraft will be resolved without too much rhetoric and political point-scoring .
We are talking here about the situation in Tibet and Sinkiang and about the widespread increase in the torture and persecution of dissidents , active trade unionists and representatives of democracy .
The persecutions must therefore be halted immediately and a dialogue entered into .
Europe cannot remain silent and watch this happen .
It must also support the resolution against China in Geneva in a couple of weeks ' time .
It is dreadful and a big disappointment , but it is not exactly surprising .
It is deeply shocking to see the world ' s largest democracy knowingly sacrifice the long-term interests of the majority of the earth ' s population on the altar of its own greed .
The United States has participated the whole time and privately forced compromises , especially on the part of us Europeans .
At the same time , we know that the United States consumes more than twice as much energy per produced unit as is on average the case in the EU.
The potential for energy saving in the United States is enormous .
We must then hope that the United States ' s political leadership will listen to reason , for positive cooperation on the part of the United States is crucial in the long run if we are to be able to stabilise the climate .
Not only does contraception give women throughout the world control over their own bodies , but condoms could also save the lives of tens of thousands of people in the African countries hit by AIDS .
This is something the Vatican has known about since 1994 , but it has tried to play down what has happened and silenced the women when they have tried to speak out or been forced to have abortions .
The Vatican must lose no time in punishing those responsible , apologise to the women affected , investigate properly what happened and publish the report in its entirety .
Unfortunately , the feeling in UNICEF is that the organisation has been given assignments to carry out only for as long as there has been no special European organisation that has been able to do so
