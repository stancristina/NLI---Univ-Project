the applicant countries , raises serious questions about whether it will be possible to finance those policies in the future in parallel with expenditure related to the COMs, given the resources available .
A second but very important problem will be created by the proposal to introduce a cofinancing system for direct income subsidies by the Member States .
As for the COMs for beef , cereals and dairy products , and granted how difficult it is to formulate common policies which will reconcile and satisfy so many different interests , the Commission 's proposals form a good basis and are on the right lines .
The particular comment concerns the conditions pertaining to the milk market in Greece , because of the distance from other markets and the existence of a large number of islands .
Meanwhile , the German Presidency 's first concern was to inform us that Germany wants a considerable cut in its contribution to the Community budget .
This cofinancing for agriculture is really tantamount to partial renationalisation , indeed up to a significant level of 24 to 25 % in accordance with the third solution in the Commission 's report .
We favour Article 209 , granted that what is involved is a financial amendment which requires unanimity in the Council , and we oppose partial renationalisation and the introduction of a generalised structural mechanism .
Mr President , in my opinion the review of the common agricultural policy is largely motivated not by the actual internal dynamics of development and the new challenges to be faced , but by pressures exerted by certain powerful Member States related to the reduction of the European Union 's budget , and especially a reduction of their own national contribution to it .
Mr President , the Commission has quite rightly proposed to extend the role of the European Agricultural Fund , which will in future undertake additional activities aiming to develop the countryside .
The common agricultural policy is a cornerstone of the Union 's European integration and an incentive towards development in the agricultural sector .
And on that point it would be useful to examine not just what those countries contribute to the budget , but also the extent to which they benefit from the common market of the European Union 's millions of purchasers .
Mr President , I thank the President-in-Office for his answer , though it cannot be categorical since the negotiations are still in progress .
Madam President , without claiming to be an expert on the subject , I nevertheless wish to stress some of the very positive aspects of the excellent report by Mr Elchlepp , and to add my voice to those of the millions of people who are fighting for the future of our planet , which is threatened by headlong destruction of the environment , by irresponsible use of natural resources and by a widening gap between rich and poor countries .
Renewable energy is certainly an important future market , because its potential is unlimited compared with the limited and low-entropy energy sources in the earth 's crust .
In any event , the European Union must cooperate closely with developing countries in the context of the new Lom√© Convention , to promote viable forms of development and to settle their debts - as proposed in the report - in exchange for coverage of their energy needs from renewable sources .
In Buenos Aires , the world 's powers assured us that they will be adopting measures in the coming century to implement the Kyoto decisions , but in the few months before the end of the millennium , ecosystems - which cannot of course await the outcome of negotiations - will have sustained further serious damage .
I also believe , however , that we all know the success of Europe 's economy will be judged not so much in monetary terms but in relation to the real economy , and there the situation is not at all encouraging .
The money market crisis in the third world , which has of course become a crisis of the real economy there , has brought about huge job losses , reductions in real incomes and a fall of our own exports .
This is a very dangerous development , because there is nothing more dangerous than a return to the restrictions on world trade , which would of course affect the weakest economies worst .
How can our farmers farm ecologically when the industries that supply them and those which are their customers impel them towards anti-ecological practices ?
Perhaps , instead of talking about ecological farming , we should be talking about an ecological economy ?
For I believe it would be a mistake for the European Union to become involved , so to speak , in a frenzy of competition with the United States over arms industry issues when the European Union still has no principles and basic mechanisms for its foreign policy .
Of course , I too wish to stress that Mr Titley 's report contains important observations which we will support despite our primary overall position , such as the issue of continuing the Konver programme , such as the subject of measures against anti-personnel mines , and such as the subject of a weapons export code which , we fear , will remain no more than a general principle .
They have no basis in reality .
I have no time , so I will try to mention only a few points .
The real aim is to establish reforms which will draw China in and subject it to your own model and to the standards dictated by your multinationals .
Is that where you want China to go as well ?
Has there not been a crisis in your own countries too , despite unrestrained liberalism ?
That is blatant and inadmissible intervention .
