What is needed is an effective , Community-wide system to protect European farmers from the risks and crises of the situation in Portugal and Spain .
That way , the standard of living and economic stability in many regions will not be affected .
This is a genuine , large-scale , natural disaster , on which the European institutions , and consequently Parliament , must focus a great deal of attention .
This situation is expected to worsen as stocks in water protection areas and in groundwater run out , and given the impossibility of operating irrigation channels .
Desperate times call for desperate measures .
We are counting on you .     – Mr President , the president of my group cannot be here in the House today , but he made his position clear in a letter published this morning .
We would have taken a different view had Mr Latsis , the owner of the yacht , been involved in financial matters requiring a decision from the European institutions , in which case the services of the Commission would have been alerted about the illadvised holiday .
The promotion of transparency requires facts , rather than insinuation or obfuscation .
We want more transparency in the Commission .
We must also address the issue of terrorist financing .
I welcome the fact that the compromise reached in the second directive , preserving the relationship of trust between lawyers and clients , has been retained .
Only those at the top table of decision-making can acquire high levels of confidence in the knowledge-based society .
Those who turn a blind eye to the fact that Europe’s future lies with the regions and with the SMEs are the same people who call for a reduction in resources for cohesion policies , those proponents of the famous charter calling for a 1 % of GDP ceiling in Member States’ contributions to the financial perspective .
The answer should not have been more of the same .
The EU must therefore , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , undergo a fundamental change of policy and direction .     .
These measures will improve coordination between the multiannual programme , its successor – the ‘ Framework Programme for Competitiveness and Innovation ’ ( CIP ) – and the Seventh Research Framework Programme .
In order to bridge the gap between the existing programmes , which finish in 2005 , and this new framework programme , Parliament has increased its support to EUR 91 million for 2006 .
In light of the Court of Justice judgment that Community institutions have exclusive competence in this area , and given the need for regulation and agreement , I am in favour of the report before us .     .
The Commission drew up a cost/benefit assessment of this agreement , which concluded that the protocol was a sizeable subsidy to the EU tuna fleets in these waters ; it led to a value-added of EUR 1.7 million .
Given that fishing opportunities for five surface longliners has been maintained , I feel that this interest has been duly protected , and therefore voted in favour .     .
The ongoing debate in Parliament and the Council on the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013 does not envisage any change in these aspects ; quite the opposite in fact .
It is a policy of simplification that could potentially make the implementation of the programmes and funds in question more effective and easier to monitor .
Whereas money laundering is not exclusively linked to financing terrorism , the truth is that this ‘crime for real criminals ’ plays a key role in financing terrorist activities .
We must ensure that a balance is struck between freedom and security , and that we do not have one at the expense of the other .     .
Accordingly , and in light of the fact that the report makes reasonable and workable proposals , I voted in favour .     .
This process is justified on the grounds that it is less cumbersome , but the truth is that it is the consumers who lose out .
In addition to the EU’s traditional concerns as regards democratisation , respecting freedoms , complying with international standards , advocating an economic model in which free initiative is not to be confused with the absolute freedom of the few or with the freedom that varies according to who is in power , the EU is now discovering the concerns of most of its most recent new Members .
It is necessary to avoid having a large number of agencies overlapping functions and creating more work .
I also welcome the fact that President Barroso has set up a group of Commissioners on Fundamental Rights , Anti-Discrimination and Equal Treatment , to establish a comprehensive and coherent strategy for protecting human rights .     .
What is needed is the courage to scrap the Stability and Growth Pact and replace it with a Growth and Employment Pact , with the accent placed on investment in manufacturing and social progress .
The revision of the Lisbon Strategy is based on the three strands of competitiveness , growth and employment .
The overriding impression is that this is a catalogue of good political intentions .
The model proposed by the Commission is based on rules that are clearly laid down , yet it is also sufficiently flexible and workable , and will encourage the 25 Member States to save energy .
Global energy policy is about far more than efficiency , however .
Such respect is essential for a body of democratic control such as ours .
The budget proposal tabled by the Commission for the new Rural Development Fund within the framework of the financial perspective for 2007-2013 is woefully inadequate , for example in the way it takes substantial amounts from this fund to finance the Natura 2000 network .
