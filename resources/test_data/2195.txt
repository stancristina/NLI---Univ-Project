affordable .
The social and environmental problems that are demonstrably to be found in many places must be solved through the ILO and the environmental conventions .
We must support those forces that are endeavouring to have the relevant requirements implemented , for example in Brazil , and , above all , we must have those requirements accepted by the WTO as obvious trading conditions .     Mr President , if the Århus Convention is to work as intended in the EU , it is crucial that the rules also guarantee certain environmental organisations ’ access to testing by the courts .
The Council’s common position does not , however , give the NGOs such access .
I regret that many members of the Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats are attempting to prevent the Århus Convention from being fairly implemented .
If we are to increase understanding of , and support for , the EU project , grass-roots participation and control are hugely important .
The European Parliament has decided to take proceedings against the Commission in the case of the brominated flame retardant BDE , on which the Commission has lifted the ban without having been given the right to do so by the legislator .
The environmental organisations too need , however , to be able to take action when EU laws are broken .
Individual citizens cannot have decisions in the environmental sphere tested because there is no individual interest .
What we have here , of course , is a case of David and Goliath .
The environmental organisations take care of public interests , while the chemicals industry , with huge sums of money behind it , can force decisions through the EU system .
We saw this with REACH.
The report contains some fine objectives .
Whenever something is really about to happen , the EU’s good intentions often all but evaporate .
The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has put forward three amendments : one calling for more ambitious targets in terms of reducing greenhouse gases , another calling for an end to dependence on nuclear energy and a practical one concerning the problems with waste that we have due to an inconsistent approach to drinks packaging .
With a common European deposit system , the Danish countryside and environment would fare much better , as would the cows that at present suffer torture when they chew on some of the many German beer cans lying around the countryside .     Mr President , Chancellor , Mr President of the Commission , we reject the December budget agreement because it by no means fulfils the objectives of a more dynamic and competitive EU and because it does not guarantee an EU with a larger role on the international stage .
We should like first and foremost , however , to have a larger and more flexible framework , and both of you have of course shown today that we shall need such a framework .
Not only are there far more countries around the table , but there are bigger differences between us in terms of prosperity .
We must find a replacement for the present method of funding , which involves contributions from the national exchequers .
Each country attaches far too much importance to its net contribution , rather than looking at the bigger picture .
With the procedure you are now proposing , this majority in favour of rejection will , however , be hidden in an attempt to have the matter referred back to committee .
It is completely insane that the Presidency should administer a procedure that can conceal the attitude of the majority in this Chamber .     The Danish Liberal Party’s Members of the European Parliament voted in favour of the first amendment , recommending rejection of the Commission ’s proposal , as it is impossible to bring about a satisfactory outcome in the light of that proposal .
The process of obtaining legislation in this area must be started afresh .     The June Movement has voted in favour of paragraph 45 of the report on the environmental aspects of sustainable development , but wants minimal directives to be used in introducing ecotaxes at Community level so that more far-reaching requirements might be laid down in the individual Member States .
Jerusalem , which is also the Palestinians ’ city , is part of the solution .
If Israel annexes the whole of Jerusalem , the key to peace will have been thrown away , and not only in that particular area but also in terms of relations between the Arab countries and the West .
Here was a clear statement that Jerusalem should be kept as an open city , and for the Palestinians too , and a request that Orient House be reopened .
This , however , is where the West’s double standards really come into their own .
Israel is completely indifferent to the EU’s statements , for the Israelis know that none of the foreign ministers take their own words seriously .
At the same time , the EU is trying to buy its way out of anything to do with the Palestinians , for whom , in conjunction with Israel’s policy of apartheid , the EU and the United States are becoming entirely responsible .
Palestine would have no chance of creating a healthy economy on those conditions and would forever be dependent on others .
Nothing will happen as long as the Council and the Commissioner do not even mention the settlements and the Wall and do not say a word about a proper state .     Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the rapporteur’s report highlights a worrying and , unfortunately , often overlooked fact : the inequality between women and men in research persists and is preventing compliance with the Lisbon objectives .
