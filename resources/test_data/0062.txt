discrimination between forced and 'voluntary ' prostitution , because both forms have the same root : they are caused by deep poverty and social exclusion , phenomena which lead women to the limits of exploitation .
However , from a legal point of view also , when the victim comes before the courts , how can a distinction be made between forced prostitution and prostitution and how can sanctions be imposed on the person behind them ?
I believe that the proposals you just mentioned , Mr Frattini , and Mrs Prets ' proposals , lay down a serious framework at European and international level .     – Madam President , the exploitation of women and children through forced prostitution , on the occasion of and centred around major sports events , is one of the scourges of our times .
Commissioner , offering advice or passing national legislation is not enough to combat this phenomenon .
I would like to ask you to postpone this by one day , as 25 March is a national holiday in Greece , one of the biggest celebrations in our history .
Without underestimating the sensitivity of the issue , I should like to remind you that the right of establishment anywhere in the Community is a fundamental freedom and cornerstone of the single market .
Of course we cannot intervene in decisions by companies or undertakings in their work ; however , we are resolved to combat the social consequences of such decisions .
Thanks to this rule , companies will stop taking recourse to subsidy hopping .
Nonetheless , it is not right for the European Union to encourage the continual relocation of companies with resources from the European budget .
I think that the European Parliament 's proposals are realistic and respond in a balanced manner to an existing problem .
If , however , the European Commission wants to develop a competitive European economy , it would be a good idea to make sure that it does not destroy the European social model in the process , that it does not destroy workers ' rights or , at the very least , that it does not create an environment which encourages companies to violate them .
Mr President , I thank both you and the members of the European Parliament for your very positive interventions .
This sort of decision is determined by numerous factors .
As I stressed earlier in my opening speech , the Commission has proposed and applied measures designed to restrict any use of the Structural Funds for purposes unconnected with the sustainable development of each area .
The objective is to discuss ideas for better support of local actions on a global scale .
The results of these discussions will constitute a material contribution to the special water and sanitation issues section of the 16th meeting of the UN Commission on Sustainable Development in 2008 .
Consequently , the Commission will not need a negotiating mandate in order to take part in this specific exchange of opinions .
As far as water management and the internal market are concerned , the Commission may , if it appears necessary , explain the position of the European Union , by which I mean that the current rules in the European Union are neutral on the question of the ownership of water and water companies .
In all events , the World Water Forum is not the appropriate platform for such a debate .     Mr President , the debate demonstrated that we have the same views on the World Water Forum on numerous counts and I hope that the Commission will benefit from taking part in the discussion at which , as I said earlier , we do not expect decisions to be taken , whether or not they are necessary .
We hope and intend that 10 million people will have drinking water in 2010 and 5 million will have access to sanitation services .
However , what is even more important is the fact that the proposed financing instrument takes account of the calls by the European Parliament and of the Council for the strengthening of the response capacity in the civil protection sector in Europe .
As a result the assistance was either not provided at all or was provided late .
Thus , the Commission is proposing to establish a backup financing network at Community level which will allow additional equipment to be hired .
This is the only way to ensure that the Community will be able to provide more coordinated , more effective and more prompt assistance to any country affected by a major emergency .     . – Mr President , I agree with Mr Dimas that we need to do more in order to make the way in which the European Union addresses extensive natural disasters , both those which affect Europe itself , such as floods , drought or fires , and other natural disasters beyond our borders , such as the tsunami or the hurricane in Mississippi and Louisiana , stronger and more effective .
If we are to succeed in this , we need , apart from what Demosthenes rightly spoke about two and half thousand years ago , for the Council to agree as well .
I should like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from all the political groups for the excellent cooperation which we had within the framework of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety and which resulted in my report and certain amendments to the Commission 's initial proposal being approved almost unanimously , by 49 votes in favour and just one against .
Prevention is one of the pillars for addressing the problem and I am delighted that , on this issue , we have the same perception as both the Commission and the Council .
