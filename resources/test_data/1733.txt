The promise is binding .
In that case , the EU will be transformed , opened up and simplified .
Are the Commission and the Council prepared to give the EU these tools ?
Citizens of the EU and of the candidate countries , as well as national parliaments and , of course , this Parliament , must be given real influence over the agenda for , the decisions about , and the method for shaping the EU' s future .
Mr President , Commissioner , I believe that many people must have been rather anxious when Mr Harbour said he wanted to see a review of the directive within 18 months .
So , is there to be a return to all that lobbying ?
It is therefore a little difficult to begin to speak now .
At first reading , we were concerned that the parliamentary majority was jeopardising the Internet ' s function and that there was a danger of creating a system which also made it unattractive to have material on the Net in Europe .
But is it the same thing as promoting the spread of science and knowledge ?
The common position is a fragile compromise which must not be disturbed .
If we impose higher costs on e-commerce and increase the cost of connection , Europe will not be the world ' s most competitive economy in ten years ' time , which was , of course , the goal set in Lisbon .
Copyright must not become a patent right because of the new technology .
I would therefore ask you to support Amendment No 4 .
I would therefore ask you to support Amendments Nos 31 and 32 .
Finally , we have a WIPO position to defend , and we must vote consistently .
This position is not changed by the clear improvements due to Directive 90/220 and which we are now discussing .
It is not advisable to adopt laws on matters about which , right from the beginning , there are different interpretations .
We have still not seen the new rules promised to us by the Commission and required for labelling , traceability and accountability .
We consider the strategy devised by the Commission whereby new crops are to be approved before these rules are fully in place to be objectionable and contrary to the precautionary principle .
There are major differences of opinion between researchers about the risks involved in GM crops .
The interests of consumers and the precautionary principle must be allowed to take precedence over the commercial interests of a few large companies .
In spite of the fact that , in the conciliation , our group has had an important role to play in making these rules as tough as possible , we cannot vote in favour of the final result .
The rapporteur has done a fantastic job .
It is important that we be aware of the risks and accept our responsibility .
I would therefore simply urge that we make our decision in accordance with the proposal before us today .
The more I read about this procedure , the more it sets me thinking .
I think it is quite clear that there is a need for a new method of standardisation based on objective assessment criteria rather than upon subjective criteria that are in the interests of the industry .
Mr Kinnock says that we would have known what the letter contained if we had been able to study it .
Mr Kinnock appears not to have learned anything from the scandal involving the Commission to which he previously belonged - the Santer Commission , which fell because it did not understand the link between transparency , on the one hand , and corruption and fraud , on the other .
If Mr Kinnock had learned anything from the Commission to which he then belonged , he would have understood .
In the same way , Mr Asp must surely have read the letter before he made his statement .
I would thank the Commissioner for his answer and should like to ask a question : where does Commissioner Kinnock believe that criticism ought to be directed ?
I myself saw the TV programme and I am able to say that she did not do so .
Because you were formerly employed at the Commission , your statement raises the question of what kind of obligations you have because , as an employee , you have to comply with various terms of employment and Staff Regulations " .
Mrs Steneberg is refusing to cooperate with the Swedish police and to travel to Stockholm for questioning .
Unfortunately , we women come up against a glass ceiling within the EU' s institutions , too .
I can only draw the conclusion that the male candidate was appointed on a quota basis .
The report is about more than just buses .
It is about the way in which the EU is to legislate .
I find it quite unreasonable that , as a politician , I should have to take decisions about how many millimetres bus door handles and luggage racks should measure .
An example is Annex V of the Council ' s common position .
Why should Parliament change its mind now ?
I would therefore call upon the whole Parliament to vote in favour of Amendment No 9 , tabled by my colleague Mr Lehne and rejecting the Council ' s common position .
At the same time , modern Turkey is also the second land of the Bible , where Saint Paul built up his first Christian congregations .
I would like to discuss a practical case in Turkey .
In this context he added the fact that other Christian peoples such as the Assyrians/Syrians were also murdered during the genocide .
My third , and final , question to
