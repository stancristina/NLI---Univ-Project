person and their family relocating within the Community .
Currently a person who is residing in another Member State to further their studies is entitled only to 'minimal health care ' if they are sick ; this is a form of basic health care or emergency health care .
The Liberal group also supports the amendment which aims to guarantee citizens from third countries studying in the EU the right to emergency medical care as well .
It ought to be possible to remove the remaining differences during the next round of reforms .
I also think that it is appropriate on a day such as this to thank Commissioner Kinnock for the commitment he has shown in proposing measures to increase safety .
One dark night in September 1994 , the terrible accident occurred in which the ferry Estonia sank on the journey between Tallinn and Stockholm .
There have never been any passenger lists .
Anyone who cares to go through the documents on what took place in the European Parliament during the days and weeks which followed the Estonia accident will see that this Parliament acted as one in demanding action to prevent , as far as possible , further disasters and to minimise the effects of such accidents when they do occur .
Information on the passengers on board is a basic requirement in this respect to make rescue work more effective .
In respect of this the transport committee has made a minor addition which I hope the Commission will be able to accept .
Let me conclude by asking the Commissioner to tell us a little more in his address about other measures he is prepared to propose with the aim of further increasing safety on ferries .
I am pleased to see that the accident with the passenger ferry Herald of Free Enterprise has been highlighted in the report but it is equally important that we remember the victims of the Estonia .
I do not think that it is totally out of the question that we should have even stricter requirements for certain stretches of water which are particularly vulnerable , the Baltic for example .
I also hope that in the future , we in Parliament , will put more emphasis on personal privacy itself and that the passenger lists are not stored too long , something which I hope we can come back to .
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on behalf of my party group .
In order to gain credibility for the new currency and to create an understanding of it , it will be necessary to communicate this strategy .
The risk of wavering has become a reality now that socialist leaders want to delay EMU or even to change it totally or to alter the stability pact .
This is why it is so important to remove barriers to cross border trade .
Our common institutions are the external framework which set the long term conditions .
A comprehensive political tax harmonisation will not solve the growth problem in Europe .
The majority of people in the EU , more than 80 percent , are also in favour of maintaining summer time .
This further emphasises the wisdom of supporting and approving the common position now .
I would just like to state that it is a little unfortunate that the discussion on this important issue , which concerns so many regions in Europe , has concentrated on only one region .
We sing in our national anthem that we are 'the land of the thousand seas ' .
Instead , I would like to see this become 'archipelago regions ' , in other words , areas where water divides the land and brings with it the need for a totally different social structure .
I would like to thank the Commissioner for his response .
I think that it is reasonable to pay tax in the country in which you make use of the public sector , regardless of the capacity in which you are employed by the European Commission .
I would very much like an answer to this question .
This has led to a situation in which anyone working permanently for an EU institution has the same rights in all EEC countries .
I have to say that in the majority of cases the differences are quite small .
The Sturdy report raises these issues .
This cannot be considered a threat to the Common Agricultural Policy .
If we take a more long term view , I am convinced that European agriculture , if it is to play a part on the world market , must adjust itself to that market .
I would , in fact , be more concerned about the future of European agriculture if we continue with an unchanged agricultural policy than if we take the bull by the horns and really take the CAP reforms to their logical conclusion .
It will be dangerous for European agriculture to continue with an outdated regulation system .
It is now that we will be able to see whether membership of the EU is what it was made out to be and what it was promised to be by those who recommended it .
Another argument was that Swedish border controls would remain in place .
But now a number of steps have been taken towards a common defence system .
It is clear from the proposal that the emphasis definitely has not been placed where it was said it would be placed , on democracy , openness , social security and sustainable development .
Let me give some examples : The achievements with regard to the demands for openness , transparency and the principle of publication are unacceptable .
If you add to this the EU 's Archive Regulation , it is easy to see that there will be nothing left of this openness .
