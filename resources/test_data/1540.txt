As regards all of the good ideas as to what my country should do with regard to the euro , for example , I would say that , if you can get the Stability and Growth Pact to work , Denmark may well consider them .
In my opinion it is not working , and I think that it is true that Mr Fogh Rasmussen has managed better than the euro .
We have now heard enough historical speeches , and it is perhaps time to get going : not with history , but with the future .
Enlargement will not make it any easier to work in the European Union .
There are many things that will become considerably more difficult , but it would have been worse if we had not prepared enlargement .
This is the other side of the coin .
I would of course urge both Denmark and the upcoming Presidency to take note of this .
That cannot be right .
We must also make a start on looking at the EU 's global role .
Are we to let the USA determine everything in this world ?
Or will the EU find a counterweight to the dominance of the USA ?
We have been aware of this in connection with enlargement : we have watched over the applicant countries , given them advice and guidance , made demands of them ; but what then , and what about ourselves ?
What will happen about the rights of the Roma when enlargement has fallen into place ?
It will not get any easier , but it is something we must follow up .
What , too , will the EU do at global level as regards oppressed peoples ?
Will we allow Russia to call the tune there ?
Will we let our policy there be determined by feta cheese and oil , or will we really back our grand words up with action ?

Mr President , I should first like to add my voice to the hearty congratulations to the Danish Presidency .
The result has garnered many positive adjectives along the way , and I should like to join in with those who say that almost all the words have now been used up ; but I concur with what has been said , and I would just say that , in my opinion , Denmark can perhaps be pleased about two things in particular .
It was in 1993 , during the Danish Presidency , that the conditions for enlargement were laid down , and now , ten years later , we have the opportunity to close the cycle during a Danish Presidency , too .
I think that this is a very good thing .
We now have a region surrounding the Baltic Sea which almost exclusively consists of Member States of the European Union .
Even if the end of the summit was perhaps somewhat mercenary - it often is - this cannot overshadow the big picture .
We must also realise that , once the New Year celebrations are over , our feet must be back on the ground , and , in any case , too many major tasks await us - as they do the new countries .
The other is to do with agriculture .
We all know that the common agricultural policy , as it stands , is grotesque and is very detrimental to the developing countries .
I wish to close with a few words about Turkey .
As you know , two things were made clear as far as Turkey is concerned , which in my opinion are very important .
One of them is that it is a candidate country that can join on the same conditions as other candidate countries .
This is a great opportunity for Turkey .
We can establish that today , at any rate , none of the political criteria - democracy , the rule of law , respect for human rights and the protection of minorities - have been met in Turkey ; so there remains a real need for further reforms , and there is above all a need to implement the reforms .
Once more , thank you for a superb Presidency and congratulations on the result .
Madam President , as an Independent Socialist I was sceptical , and in August I did not believe that enlargement would succeed , but I must admit that I have lost my bet with the President-in-Office of the Council ; so I shall have to buy Mr Fogh Rasmussen a beer after this debate .
He , the Danish Government and especially the civil servants have pursued the goal , and have achieved it .
The fa√ßade of the new EU house has been built and decorated ; now it is a case of putting the furniture in place .
The greatest task is without doubt reform of the common agriculture policy .
I still believe that the EU should have reformed the system of subsidies to European farmers before the decision to enlarge the EU was taken .
I also wish to say to you , Prime Minister , that the fact that Mr Bonde is opposed to it is the best sign that this is a really good result .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Prime Minister , congratulations on the fabulous result that you , the Danish Government and the Danish civil service have produced .
Enlargement has finally put the Second World War to rest .
In the last century , Poland was one of the hardest hit territories in Europe , mistreated from both east and west by regimes whose totalitarian ideologies left behind nothing but destruction and terrible memories .
Now it is justice that holds sway , and not brute force , among our 25 countries and in relation to the countries around us .
We
