Nor are temporary agencies affected , and this in anticipation of a separate directive specifically concerned with such agencies .
Some people believe that this is an unclear compromise .
I maintain that this directive would emphatically mean progress .
It is clearer than the regulations we have at present , and we should therefore vote in favour of it .     Mr President , Commissioner , this is a huge step for the EU and a small step for free trade .
It is important for small companies , and it is especially important for small countries .
Allow me to give two examples .
If a group of Swedish tourists goes on holiday to Greece accompanied by a diving instructor , the person concerned must actually be able to speak Greek .
We can improve this compromise on Thursday by reducing the number of exemptions and also including private health care .
Free trade in services is something positive , not negative .
It is not what Europeans expect .
We shall make efforts to have private health care added to the directive , to have the Posting Directive made clearly and unambiguously open to all and to prevent any discrimination against the people of any country .
The idea of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons is , of course , incredibly frightening , especially in the light of its statements about , and threats against , Israel and in terms of what such a development would mean for the rest of the region .
This strategy should , however , also include preparing possible sanctions decided on in the UN Security Council .     Mr President , the current debate is very important .
As a member of the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs and of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and as Vice-Chair of Social Democratic Women in Europe , I receive very worrying reports and accounts concerning violations of both women’s and children’s rights .
The dialogue between the EU and Iran must be resumed .
The statements about Israel are unacceptable , as are executions , death sentences and the taking of political prisoners .
This must be put an end to now , while there is still time .     The June List wholeheartedly supports the IAEA’s efforts to achieve a peaceful solution to the confrontation between Iran and the international community and believes that it is the UN Security Council that is ultimately responsible for deciding on the measures that should be taken .
We have therefore chosen to refrain from trying to change the resolution and have voted against it in its entirety .     Mr President , in order to understand why the situation in Bosnia is so complicated today and why we need constitutional reform in Bosnia , we must understand the background .
On the contrary , there were many who believed that it was not good at all .
Ten years later , we note that the consequences of the Dayton Agreement are such that it is difficult for Bosnia to operate as a normal European country .
These parties still wield more or less absolute political power and share a more or less pronounced ambition to rule over a certain territory populated by a particular ethnic group .
I was born , and grew up , in Bosnia and I experienced the war in that country .
The situation in Belarus is becoming worse and worse .
In this situation , we must do everything we can to support the forces of democracy and make efforts to bring about both a fair election and extensive election monitoring .
In Sweden , forests and forest management account for nearly 30 % of the economy , and there are more than 15 million forest owners in Europe .
There are huge differences between an olive grove in southern Italy and an industrial forestry business in northern Sweden .
This is the starting point for those of us in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety .
That does not , however , mean that the EU does not have any responsibility for forestry .
We in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety find , however , that coordination between the various proposals affecting our forests is almost non-existent .
In conclusion , I should like to emphasise the importance of forest management .
They were rather disappointed at not being able to meet more of us , and I therefore promised to inform you of what they wanted to say .
Everybody should respect each other , and respect goes both ways .
This trafficking in human beings is shameful and deeply inhumane .
Women do not choose prostitution ; they are forced into it for one reason or another .
What , for example , does the fact that prostitution is legal in Germany signify in terms of the increase in the number of victims of sex trafficking in connection with the World Cup ?
It is they who must accept responsibility for their sexuality , without buying women’s bodies .
We want to see all women given the right to their sexuality , and on equal conditions and without being oppressed .
A few years ago , Iran was hit by a terrible and disastrous earthquake .
What is , in any case , clear is that the rescue efforts would have been more successful if there had been better EU cooperation .
It is also true that aid could have been provided more efficiently on those occasions that the EU Member States have been hit by , for example , major floods and forest fires .
We Social Democrats have particularly emphasised the need for this instrument to operate both within and outside the EU , partly in view of the fact that our own citizens are often outside the EU
