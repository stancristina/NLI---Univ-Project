.
I very much hope that , in the conciliation procedure , we shall find a solution regarding this directive that both meets the need for more effective monitoring and , at the same time , ensures that drivers have sufficient flexibility .     Mr President , road transport has become a mess of an industry which genuinely needs tidying up .
Drivers ’ crude working conditions have been discussed , as have the consequences for road safety .
Quite apart from this , however , the conditions of competition are completely awry .
We are in favour of fair competition , and road hauliers should of course pay the real price for decent transport and not simply pass all the consequences of their activities onto society .
With fair pricing through sensible regulation and firm controls , there are also better chances of other forms of transport that are safe and environmentally friendly being able to develop .
It must be the best form of transport that is able to carry the day , not the most brazen or the most ruthless .     Mr President , I see that Mr Watson is not present in the House , and that is something I regret .
It is not of course Mr  Juncker’s fault that France now has a government so unpopular that it is in no position to convince the French population to vote in favour of the Treaty .
The truth is , of course , that Mr  Juncker himself , via the European Council held in March of this year , has ensured that the rest of us are in a position to explain to the French population that we now have a sensibly designed Stability and Growth Pact , that the balances in the Lisbon process have been retained and that we are now in a position to tackle the next step , as pointed out by Mr Almunia , Economic and Financial Affairs Commissioner , who said that , by using the two instruments , together with macroeconomic initiatives , we are in actual fact in a position to create more , and new , jobs in Europe .
I should like to say to Mr Watson , to the Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats and to others , irrespective of whether or not they are present in the House , that what is at issue here is a responsibility shared by them and ourselves , as well as by the President of the Commission , Mr Barroso , by the whole of the Commission and by Mr  Juncker and the Council .
France cannot create more , new and better jobs alone .
Europe is not a matter of daily spectacle and major revolutions .
That has also been emphasised by the speakers from the Council and the Commission , and I should like to thank them for the accounts they have given .
I should like to cite an example from Denmark .
Recently , we have seen how one of the Danish parties that plays a crucial role in the EU debate , namely the Socialist People’s Party , has changed from being eurosceptic to being europhile .
The next major challenge is this particular region , and , as we have recently seen , there are still of course problems in Albania , Macedonia , Bosnia-Herzegovina , Serbia-Montenegro , Kosovo and Croatia , with accession negotiations having had to be postponed .
What is important , however , is to insist that these countries have prospects in terms of Europe , for it is those prospects that can be the very driving force they need .
Moreover , we in the rest of Europe very much need to show that what we have here is a key area for European cooperation .
It will be a year in which we shall of course – and hopefully as quickly as possible – have found a positive settlement with regard to Croatia .
I should also like to take this opportunity to say thank you for your cooperation in connection with the resolution and its preparation .
We can then get the process seriously under way , and matters will make sense to all the parties involved and appear to be going somewhere .     Mr President , in connection with adopting this resolution , we reached agreement in the Committee on Foreign Affairs on using the name ‘the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia’ when referring to this country in contexts not concerning the actual debate about the future name .
This means , in other words , that , if amendments are adopted today with reference to Macedonia and if these are not concerned with the issue of the name , the term used in the final version will be ‘the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia’ .
We can do something about the actual issue of the name when we come to Amendment 6 and Amendment 25 .     Health is a fundamental social right and one of the cornerstones of the European social model .
It provides security .
Work therefore needs to be done on harmonising and improving the quality of the health care Europeans receive .
The ageing of the population will create problems in relation to the national health systems ’ capacity to secure access and quality in the future .
Modernisation is required .
We have to remember that prevention is the most effective form of health care .
The mid-term evaluation of the Lisbon Strategy also emphasises the need for the social pillar .
If we are to go on securing a well-educated and skilful labour force , we must be able to offer effective and universal health care .
More should also be done to improve our working environment so that we prevent accidents at work and work-related illnesses .
