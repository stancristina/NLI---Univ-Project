As a long-term objective the Schengen Agreement should be made part of the fundamental agreements of the EU.
This is the only way to ensure democratic decision-making and a judicial monitoring by the European Court .
The Council and the Commission should set a schedule for achieving the objective , for example by the end of year 2000 .
Madam President , I agree with my fellow representative Mr Olli Rehn that there is no reason to fear that Iceland and Norway would start to sabotage Schengen decisions , if they were to join in the way presently being discussed .
It should also be pointed out that Finland joined the Schengen Agreement rather passively , in fact without any extensive public debate , and as far as I know even the Finnish parliament has had its doubts as to whether Finland even needs an arrangement like the present Schengen Agreement .
It is clear that there is no reason to create a European security state which controls and puts every citizen under suspicion .
There is also a problem regarding what would happen if Norway were to decide to stay outside the Schengen Agreement .
Free movement should be developed by means other than the Schengen Agreement within the European Union , and such issues as those concerning data protection and the position of the individual are absolutely vital .
The development in the Baltic and the Mediterranean areas is important for the stability and prosperity of the whole of Europe .
It was of great value that all states in the Baltic area , including Russia , participated in the summit , in addition to the European Union .
In the Baltic area widespread co-operation is required in order to counteract international crime and resolve severe environmental problems , amongst other things .
An energy network comprising the whole of Europe , linking Norway 's and Russia 's gas resources , should be extended to this area .
The European Union 's Baltic policy should be based on existing Europe agreements as well as a full implementation of co-operation and partnership agreements .
Stringent safety measures are required to prevent explosions .
I am glad to hear that Mr Mather has come to this conclusion after reading the Commission 's proposal , considering that the British government formed by the party he represents has systematically opposed the health and safety regulations drawn up by the European Union .
It has been mentioned that the report was accepted unanimously by the committee .
On many issues it would have been better to rely on the Commission 's expertise , instead of proposing apparent amendments .
On the whole I congratulate Mr Mather on this report .
This amendment is a clear improvement of the directive .
Benzene exposure occurs for example in oil refineries , in connection with petrol transport and distribution , that is at service stations and garages , and in the petrochemical industry .
Users of power saws may also be exposed to benzene .
The European Parliament has already demanded that limit values be set for all carcinogens .
The Commission has already drawn up a priority list of substances for which limit values should subsequently be set .
A considerable weakness in the Commission 's proposal is that skin absorption has not sufficiently been taken into account .
The definition of limit values in the report is taken from the Commission 's proposal for a directive on chemical substances .
The Committee on Social Affairs and Employment recommends that the definition for limit values as a concept is clarified .
Legislation should make a clear distinction between two concepts , the air of the workplace and the breathing air of the employee .
The committee 's report also recommends that a common measuring practice is created for defining limit values for benzene content .
They are also in contravention of the health and safety regulations .
Decrease in exposure however also decreases the risks .
The limit value of 1 ppm proposed by the Commission may , if exposed to over a working life , cause 0.5-6.6 more cases of leukemia per 1000 workers .
The Committee on the Environment has proposed a limit value of 0.1 ppm by the beginning of year 2001 , and I myself put this proposal forward to the Committee on Social Affairs , but it was not accepted .
I would like to thank the Commission for their willingness to co-operate , and I am happy that Ireland will bring this issue to the Council for consideration as soon as their period of presidency begins .
The exceptions are not in my opinion necessary , not even for the two years proposed by the Commission , but the Commission has its own view on this and I hope that Parliament takes a different view .
If this target were to be set at 1 % , as many countries have already done , it would be considerably easier to reach the 1 ppm target particularly at service stations , where petrol of course is handled a lot .
In this connection I would merely like to point out that the scientific information on the dangers of all carcinogens - as we know there is not sufficient information regarding all substances - but clearly the Commission has not understood my intentions behind the proposal of this plan .
This would speed up these issues considerably .
On the whole , as I said before , I would like to thank the Commission for its co-operation on this issue and hope that we can now move forward .
In his opinion the Ombudsman and his office can succeed in this only if the Community 's bodies and institutions are totally committed to these principles and to co-operation with the Ombudsman .
From this point of view he has the opportunity to bring his influence to bear on the development of sound administration .
It is the constitutional
