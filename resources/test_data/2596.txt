The matter is potentially a very serious one , involving perhaps a breach of Article 10 of the Treaties , and I believe it requires more serious consideration than can be given to a topical and urgent motion on a Thursday afternoon .
This matter has been drawn to the attention of the Committee on Citizens ' Rights and Freedoms , Justice and Home Affairs , which I have the honour to chair .
We have received the opinion of the Director of the Monitoring Centre on the matter , we have asked our budget rapporteur to investigate more widely the question of the Austrian government 's attitude to the European Union Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia .
We need to know the full facts regarding the resignation of Mr Pelinka , the Austrian member of the Centre 's Executive Board .
It may be that we need to refer the matter to the Group of Three Wise Persons charged with investigating the situation in Austria .
But a topical and urgent motion would shed more heat than light on the matter , and seems to me to be an inappropriate vehicle .
Therefore I would appeal to Members to vote against this request .
( Parliament gave its assent ) The other two requests therefore lapse , and there are no further requests for amendments to the agenda .
( The order of business was adopted thus amended )
European Council/Portuguese presidency Mr President , firstly I would like to add my voice to those who earlier paid their respects to the memory of President Pflimlin .
One of his lasting legacies is an understanding of the continuing need of the strength of the three political institutions of the EU and for mutual respect between them .
It is perhaps inevitable as we are discussing the ending of the Portuguese Presidency that , with the recent speeches in Berlin , the memory is going to focus more on the second half of the IGC than the first , but I would like at this stage to record my thanks to the Portuguese Presidency for their assiduousness in consulting the Parliament both here in the plenary and in the Constitutional Affairs Committee .
The Berlin speeches by Foreign Minister Fischer , visionary and controversial , by President Chirac , controversial but not visionary , and by Prime Minister Blair , neither visionary nor controversial , which threaten to overshadow the memory of the Portuguese Presidency , leave certain questions in the mind which the Portuguese Presidency can still help us with .
Firstly I understand that Prime Minister Jospin has said that he would rather see no agreement in December in Nice than an unsatisfactory institutional reform .
Could the Portuguese Presidency confirm that sufficient work has been done to ensure that agreement can be reached in December ?
Secondly , on enlargement , could he confirm that there is still the political will in the Council so that candidate countries , this House and the public of Europe can expect to hear target dates announced for the first wave of accession ?
This is something that the Commission and many in this House would like to see .
My last question on close cooperation would include Commissioner Patten , if he is able to demonstrate that he has not imposed a vow of silence .
Is it the case that the Council still attaches importance to the democratic interplay between the three institutions and that closer cooperation will not inevitably mean greater decision making by one institution , by the Council , to the detriment of Parliament and Commission and , by implication , the people of Europe ?
Mr President , I came to this opinion on behalf of the Legal Affairs Committee with many misgivings .
The suggested extension of the directive to a new swathe of businesses and professions looks on the face of it to be both dangerous and burdensome : dangerous in that there might be a threat to the privileged lawyer/client relationship which is the linchpin of access to justice in a civil society , and burdensome because in theory this directive would now extend to your local high street jeweller .
However , it is one thing to require a multinational firm of accountants to comply with this sort of regulation , quite another to require a small firm or one-person business to do so .
I was attracted at first by the outrage of colleagues who said that this proposal represented the state turning lawyers and others into policemen on their behalf - but as I read and researched , my views changed .
We must bear in mind , as has already been said by the rapporteur , that the proposal we are considering is before us at our request , at the request of Parliament , because we wanted to get to grips with money-laundering , with this international crime which represents a substantial threat to the single market .
I have been impressed by the results obtained in England by the Criminal Investigation Unit , working with lawyers under what are already very extensive rules and regulations , but respecting professional privilege .
They have been particularly successful .
We should learn from that experience .
In Scotland , lawyers are encouraged to see tough rules as self-defence for lawyers , protecting them against the claim of involvement in crime .
We should as a Parliament stick to our original desire to tackle money-laundering strongly as a manifestation of organized crime and it seems to me that perhaps this problem will come back to haunt us .
It is a shame that we have not been able to deal with this problem as what it is , a matter of criminal law , but have had instead to deal with it within the strait-jacket of the internal market context .
Mr President , I should
