It is precisely because high costs are involved that we should clearly place topics to be analysed within a legal framework so that the results do not prove to be worthless for future use for various purposes .
It has been said that the EU-Africa Summit turned a 'new page ' .
These are matters which , though they may not mean much to some Members , are most important for fishermen . 8.
It is led by four Saudi women .
Indeed , I am convinced that Europe today is stronger , more self-assured and more confident .
But let us begin with the goal that was the most important of all : the Treaty .
The challenge of affirming the values underlying our political project and that affirmation of values and of European citizenship is contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights that we proclaimed in this Parliament but which has legal force through its inclusion in the Treaty of Lisbon .
Finally , the challenge of having stronger and more capable institutions , institutions equal to the new demands that Europe is facing .
The Treaty : this priority was achieved under the Portuguese Presidency .
We now have a policy with BRIC - Brazil , Russia , India and China - that serves a Europe that wants to be a global political player .
And perhaps Portugal 's sensitivity made it better placed to appreciate that this was a mistake .
Ladies and gentlemen , I am in no doubt that anyone at all familiar with these issues , anyone interested in human rights , in issues of climate change , of migration and immigrant advocacy , of development or security , will be pleased to see that Europe and Africa have at last set up a political framework for negotiation and dialogue .
I would also like you to know that it was during the Portuguese Presidency , at the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly , that a moratorium on the death penalty was agreed and that vote came as a result of a European proposal that honours European traditions and values .
It is for that reason that if there is a symbolic moment of this Presidency it will be when the Portuguese and other politicians , and the President of the Commission , are present at those borders to mark the moment when controls are abolished , thereby realising a European dream and aspiration to create that area of freedom of movement and security that the Schengen area represents .
At the latest Council , the President of the Commission had the opportunity to present the Commission 's document defining the bases of that policy , a migration policy that essentially has three pillars : inclusion of immigrants , combating illegal immigration , and cooperation with countries of origin , so as to regulate migratory flows and thereby protect immigrants .
As regards energy and climate change , I would like to highlight just two points : the first was the conclusion of the strategic plan for energy technologies .
A declaration on globalisation , but also an agreement on the Reflection Group .
This Presidency , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , is a Presidency of a pro-European country , a country that clearly understands that it is defending its own interests through the European project , in a country committed to European ideals , in a country led by European politicians who clearly understand that what Europe needs is to develop the European project and that this European project is probably the most generous , most critical and most important project of modern times , that this European project is important for Europeans , for the European economy , and also important for the world .
( Applause ) on behalf of the PSE Group . - ( PT ) Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , firstly I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr ≈êry , on his balanced report .
We welcome the rapporteur 's position in this case too , and we understand and share the view that only a limited number of absolutely essential amendments should be supported , as we said in committee .
This vote relates to the second reading of the proposal initially made by the European Commission in 2002 .
In the context of the debate on building a European strategy on the rights of the child , I think we should give priority to the concept of the 'interests of the child' , not in opposition to the idea of rights , but to complement them , and also as a guiding theme of the strategy .
I voted in favour of the report by Doris Pack on 'Adult learning : it is never too late to learn' , because I consider that adult learning , through the acquisition of essential skills , is crucial for achieving the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy of greater economic growth , competitiveness and social inclusion .
As the report says , adult learning is a vital component of lifelong learning and a very complex sector .
In some countries this percentage exceeds 25 % , such as in Bulgaria and the Czech Republic , and in others it is around 20 % , such as in Portugal , Greece and Hungary .
We must therefore encourage initiatives that contribute to the development in companies of positive measures and human resources policies promoting gender equality .
We therefore call on them to act , whether by defining high standards for health protection at work that take account of the gender dimension , notably maternity protection , or through working time and organisation that respect family life , or by creating effective inspection mechanisms ensuring respect for employment rights and trade union freedom , or by guaranteeing comprehensive access to good public social
