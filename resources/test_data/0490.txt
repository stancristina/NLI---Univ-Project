works of art in the European Union has a special feature which we cannot and should not remove : Europe has one of the two main trading centres for great contemporary works of art , London .
In addition to the legal reasons in favour of this initiative , it is hard to sidestep the reality that disparities in national provision on resale right , which does not exist in four Member States , produce distortions in the internal market .
This is not only because , after the many debates , I do not think reliable data exist to carry out such a study beyond what the Commission has already done , but also because of consistency with this Parliament 's function as co-legislator .
The rapporteur proposes the adoption of Amendment No 57 , tabled by the European People 's Party , or the very similar No 21 , originating from the Committee on Legal Affairs , as a reasonable solution which responds to the principles constituting the identity of European culture - that is , the protection of artistic creation - and fulfils the purpose of correcting distortions inside the single market and maintaining the competitiveness of the Union in the external market .
At a time when the whole of commercial and services law is being harmonized , consideration must be given to the appropriateness of drawing up an international convention which removes the reference in the Berne Convention to resale right as a purely optional right .
We agree with the choice of issues that require regulation and also with the generic proposal which inspires the directive .
So we support the amendments proposing an increase in the percentages .
Today we have the opportunity to ask for clear accounts in the Union and the proper use by Community institutions of the resources granted to them .
But as the rapporteur was Mr Wynn , I can say he is a reasonable Member of Parliament who is capable of listening to the arguments of others and achieving a text acceptable to all parties - even if I recognize that he probably does know something about the market for olive oil .
That approach would devalue Parliament and every Member of Parliament .
The same goes for olive oil , where highly topical measures are being recommended .
That is why the Committee on External Economic Relations has endorsed the agreement , but that is also why , on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations , I must deplore and express my disagreement with the procedure followed by the Committee on Foreign Affairs , which issued its endorsement without taking account of our committee 's opinion .
But all these positive aspects , ladies and gentlemen , are - as I said earlier - endangered by the deadlock in the peace process .
The European Union must play an active and autonomous role in supporting the peace process .
Clearly this situation will have a decisive influence on the outcome of the La Valletta meeting , because it should not be forgotten that the Euro-Mediterranean Agreements are the first offer Israel has had to escape from the enclave situation it has existed in since its creation .
The process of dialogue must be encouraged , and it is unacceptable that a process in line with the UN resolutions , the Madrid Conference , the Oslo Conference and everything that has happened since - and hence our agreement with the Palestinian Authority - should be exhausted in six months , destroying trust and creating Bantustans .
All this will contribute to achieving the essential objective of greater cohesion by reducing the disparities that still exist despite the undeniable advances in the socio-economic development of the regions .
And in trade negotiations the current practice is retaliation , so could the Council consider possible retaliation against the United States Government in that if it does not accept the jurisdiction of the World Trade Organization on the Helms-Burton Law , the Community will not accept the jurisdiction of that organization on bananas ?
Secondly , we also want alternative solutions set out for the improvement of air quality , like support for research into alternative car engines and measures applying to traffic .
We disagree with the Mam√®re report on the time factor .
Madam President , may I start with a general comment : when significant Community legislation is drafted there is an ultimately political purpose behind both the Commission 's initiative and any action taken by this Parliament .
And according to the Commission 's text , the facts to be proved are those which support the presumption of discrimination .
That is , I think it can certainly be disputed whether the legal basis chosen provides sufficient coverage for some typical measures , especially as it is optional as well as vague .
I also hope that , in the future , when the treaty has been revised , these issues can finally be dealt with by a majority and not unanimously .
In a fishery such as that of the Community where there is such a variety of fishing undertakings , species and types of fishing , in many cases with strong popular support , the acceptance of a rule which will lead to a single management method must , by necessity , engender a lot of tension and debate .
The failure of the Common Fisheries Policy is due , among other things , to the quite ineffective control policy which did not manage to prevent the activities of boats infringing the rules .
What is the point in complying with and toughening up technical measures if the whole sector knows that failure to fulfil these is not penalised and that this is the real reason for the capture of juvenile fish ?
Not enough time has passed to permit us to draw conclusions that would result in a change in the law .
