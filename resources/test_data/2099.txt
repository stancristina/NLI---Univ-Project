is being imposed , with strong incentives and sales of the rights of small and medium-sized vineyards to companies in the sector , thereby fostering the creation of cartels , using as their pretext the structural surpluses and the need to balance supply and demand on the Community market in order to safeguard better prices .
In Greece , over 200 000 decares were grubbed up .
Surpluses were reduced temporarily , but the problem reappeared with mass imports and in fact resulted in the distillation of even high-class wines .
Nor can I agree with today 's report , because in essence it proposes a longer transitional period for the application of the new regulation , with certain amendments to the proposed measures in order to blunt the consequences .
We radically disagree and have no intention of helping to delude the peoples as to the nature of the policy to 'combat terrorism ' .
I voted in favour of the Fava report because it is an historic step in the fight against a criminal international parastate .
The results of the Paris session are a slap in the face for everyone who believed that opposition and interests would be overcome in light of the serious danger of the planet 's overheating and of the catastrophic medium - and long-term repercussions for the peoples of this earth .
It is precisely this policy of capital that is responsible for contaminating the environment and for emissions and it cannot be a criterion for protecting it .
The joint resolution on the Lisbon Strategy by the Group of the European People 's Party ( European Democrats ) and Christian Democrats , social democrats and liberals adopted by the European Parliament proves once again the agreement between the political spokesmen of capital on promoting their strategic choices .
The Greek Communist Party group in the European Parliament voted against the resolution and calls on the working classes to step up its fight against all the anti-grassroots policies of the Î•U and its 'centre right ' and 'centre left ' governments and to claim permanent , stable employment with rights , a national social insurance and health system and free state education .
Mr President , Commissioner , I too should like to take my turn in emphasising that the purpose of this proposal is not to harmonise questions of ethics or morals ; it is for the national competence of the Member States to be respected as regards whether or not sensitive products are used .
My answer is no .
Europe needs this regulation and it needs it now .
Following the ancient saying of Hippocrates : 'prevention is better than cure ' , an integrated strategy would consist of promoting effective prevention .
At the same time , of course , together with the prevention efforts , we must promote the fields of research and innovation that will give us the ability to have new medications and possibly vaccines .
Mr President , if I were a Palestinian citizen looking enthusiastically towards the European Union to get me out of the impasse I was in , I would agree with Mr Swoboda and with Mrs Caroline Lucas and I would be very concerned about certain aspects of the Rocard report .
The first problem with the report is that it upgrades the strategy of the European Council and the European Commission in the Middle East , which calls on all of us to only talk to half the members of the government of Palestine and ignore the fact that this government is the product of democratic elections , that it is a government of national unity and is supported by 96 % of the Palestinian people .
If the Union misses this crucial crossroads , the road forward will be very difficult .
The proposal for a regulation on public passenger transport services by rail and by road is yet another attack on grassroots income and on the rights of the public transport workers and passengers in general .
The workers are also fighting against the anti-grassroots policy of the European Union in the transport sector .
That is also the reason why such a small number of amendments was tabled by my honourable friends , together with the fact that the report was passed unanimously by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety .
The action plan is a vital tool and is our last opportunity to bring together actors at Community and Member State levels on key actions to meet the 2010 commitments .
I urge the Member States to ensure that projects funded by Cohesion and Structural Funds do not harm biodiversity and ecosystem services but optimise benefits to biodiversity .
The Commission must come forward as soon as possible with an analysis of options for further legislation to curb imports of illegally harvested timber .
It is the responsibility of Member States to take up all available opportunities under the CAP , CFP , Cohesion and Structural Funds , LIFE+ and the Seventh Framework Programme and to allocate national resources .
The European Union action plan up to 2010 is very ambitious but , unfortunately , it does not propose simple solutions to the problem of implementation and the lack of funding and political will on the part of the Member States .
The admissible presence of GMOs and the addition of supplements (vitamins etc. ) from GMOs to organic foods are the back door for using modified organisms in countries and areas resisting their use , which they recognise as dangerous .
Unfortunately , our proposals to ban modified organisms in organic food were not accepted ; but the fight continues with the workers for healthy crops and healthy food .
This regulation must set an example .
The report takes it as given that national health systems will be inadequate and that health services will not be free
