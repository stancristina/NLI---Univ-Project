applicant countries must comply , but also a commitment with which the EU must comply .
Mrs Buitenweg ' s guidelines are excellent in the way they address the issue .
I have voted against this request on the basis of the Swedish Christian Democrats ' view of , and concern about , the principle of subsidiarity established in the Treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam , since it cannot be the European Union ' s responsibility to legislate on issues concerning education , in this case e-learning .
Buitenweg report ( A5-0103/2001 ) :
Consequently , Swedish citizens are at present exempt from that rule when they travel in other Nordic countries .
Swedish ID documents make no mention of citizenship , but it has been possible , in spite of that , to use them within Scandinavia .
I cannot interpret Mr Vitorino ' s answer in any other way .
It is my understanding that the Commission has had assurances at the highest Russian level that no deployment has taken place .
She has been exemplary in the way she has attended to her task as rapporteur .
The same applies to the labour market .
Unemployment among people with disabilities is very high .
Disability is not a static phenomenon .
This is something which is possible to implement , because it is about changes to the environment .
In the labour market , where unemployment is approximately three times higher for people with disabilities , it is important that , in addition to devising indicators for improving older people ' s , women ' s and other groups ' chances of obtaining work , we should also include people with disabilities .
That is incredibly important if attitudes are to be changed .
Madam President , honourable Members of the European Parliament , I would like to give my and the presidency ' s picture of the summit in Stockholm .
The summit in Lisbon provided a powerful direction for the Union in creating a competitive , world-leading , dynamic economy with social cohesion .
Rising to this challenge is a joint necessity for all fifteen Member States .
Secondly : biotechnology .
We must not flinch at the difficult moral and ethical issues linked to this technology .
The fourth point we are adding is for the candidate countries to also take part in the Lisbon Process in the future .
The guidelines have been set and have once more been confirmed by the European Council in Stockholm .
Our focus is full employment and active welfare states .
The first issue is the creation of an internal European market for financial services .
It is true that we did not achieve the timetable we had hoped for , but this will take place and we emphasise our desire to go down this route .
It is therefore important that we proceed with the deregulation of the gas and electricity markets as we have proposed in principle , but it must also proceed according to schedule .
We will also start a new WTO round .
There are still certain things which need to be clarified , for example concerning finance , but we consider this a socially beneficial project which must be carried out and as quickly as possible .
This is primarily what was addressed in the discussions on economic issues in Stockholm .
The second aspect of the process is the social agenda .
In terms of the social aspect , a new goal for employment has been set : it is primarily important that we concentrate on those aged over 55 in the European labour force .
In terms of equal opportunities we seek to create not only a social Europe but also a modern Europe .
In order to create quality in work , whereby people are able to remain longer in their jobs without being forced into early retirement , workplaces need to be developed so that people who are not in complete health or not completely capable can also find a place in the world of work .
In Gothenburg we will also return to an initial evaluation of European pension systems .
Is this something which places a burden on normal wage earners , white collar and blue collar workers , is it just a question of whether one has a secure income on retirement ?
We will return to this in Gothenburg .
That is what was addressed concerning the Lisbon Process at the summit .
President Putin was invited to take part and met the group of 15 Heads of State or Government in face to face discussions .
Some concrete results were achieved : firstly we are opening up opportunities for an EIB loan to Russia .
We will give Russia every support in this process .
This was addressed during the discussion with President Putin .
When we , the Heads of State or Government , were meeting , it was natural for us , given the crisis developing in Macedonia at that time , to meet him and express our solidarity , but also to emphasise the importance of the various population groups in FYROM being treated in such a way that they all feel they have a place in society and a right to participate and be present .
This will be followed by a similar agreement with Croatia .
The background to this is that we wish to express support for the process of reconciliation and d√©tente now under way there .
The fourth foreign policy question which was discussed was the situation in the Middle East , which is ever present in the minds of all politically involved Europeans .
War , conflict and destruction in the Middle East are matters which also affect us .
All of us in the Union , whatever country we live in , have a deep personal involvement in this part of the world
