As MEPs , we constantly hear complaints that this is an unwieldy system .
It is the long time it takes to make the payments that is a problem , and one that the Commission must do something about .
You too , Mr Barnier , have put simplification on the agenda .
How quickly will it be possible , however , for the work on simplification to take effect ?
Will it have done so by 2003 ?
Thank you , Mr President .
Mr President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , it has been very useful to attend the debate on behalf of the Council .
I have taken note of the various points of view , and I can assure you that I shall pass them on to my colleagues in the Council .
Like the European Parliament , the Council is particularly alert to the large surplus in respect of the EU budget , amounting last year to EUR 15 000 million .
With regard to the mid-term review of agricultural policy , I should like to emphasise that the Danish Presidency will do what it can to further the negotiations on reform .
Yesterday evening , we had an extraordinary trialogue on this subject , and I am pleased to be able to say that the European Parliament , the Commission and the Council are agreed that the necessary decisions can be taken and legal acts adopted before the end of October .
I anticipate the Council 's being able to make the necessary contribution to this process .
There is now already in theory an agreement to establish a fund of up to EUR 1 000 million per year , and it is important for the EU as quickly as possible to be able to step up its aid to the victims of the floods in Austria , Germany and the candidate countries affected .
I am very pleased with this result .
It was agreed on 19 July that the administrative preparation for enlargement is a main priority that the institutions will be able to address from now on and throughout 2003 , and I should like to emphasise that the administrative basis for enlargement has been secured by means of the agreement on administrative expenditure for 2003 .
There has also , here today , been a very thorough debate on the EU 's external tasks .
As I mentioned to begin with , an important priority in this connection is the EU 's assumption of responsibility for the UN 's policing mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina .
The fact that the emergency aid reserve for humanitarian assistance can now also be used for civil crisis management is also a significant result .
I am of course aware that that there is still a way to go before we can enter into a final joint agreement on the 2003 budget .
Today 's debate has helped clarify Parliament 's and the Commission 's ideas and attitudes , and I am certain that we can continue the sound cooperation between the institutions and , together , find the necessary solutions so that , in December , a budget can be adopted based on a detailed prioritising of EU funds within the financial estimates .
In this way , we shall be able jointly to meet the challenges of the next few years .
Thanks to his knowledge , expertise and focus , we have obtained a very stringent report .
That is a matter on which I agree with him , in spite of the fact that our political starting points are otherwise very different .
Unemployment is nonetheless still high in many countries , and it has almost become a persistent feature of countries that set the trend .
What ought therefore to happen ?
It is important that we simplify the employment strategy and make its objectives clearer , and the Commission and the Council are both thinking along those lines .
It is the correct path to go down .
Rather than draw up a long list of quantitative objectives covering every conceivable aspect and then measure success in terms of the amount of reports and paper generated , we must clarify the objectives and ensure good communication .
That is something for which Parliament has fought , and it has now become an integral part of the European employment strategy .
On the other hand , I think that open coordination should continue to be intergovernmental , and it must be flexible .
It is therefore important that no change be made by the back door to the character of employment policy by , for example , giving Parliament the right of co-decision .
It is also essential to ensure coordination with economic policy .
Many countries struggle with large budget deficits which they would not have at all if they were to abolish large-scale unemployment .
Mr President , thank you for your very friendly welcome .
The World Summit in Johannesburg took place from 26 August to 4 September 2002 .
The Danish Presidency - the Danish Minister for the Environment - attached great importance to remaining in close contact with participants from the European Parliament .
I would like to compliment Parliament on Mr Lannoye 's report , which was adopted in April and was an important document in the whole process .
As a leading player , we had to encourage the viewpoints established at the previous Council meetings of Environment , Development and Foreign Ministers in Seville .
As you know , the decision to hold the summit was taken by the UN General Assembly in autumn 2000 , the same year in which the Millennium Summit adopted the eight Millennium Goals for reducing poverty by 2015 .
In parallel with the lead-up to Johannesburg , two other international conferences were held at ministerial level : the WTO 's ministerial conference
