It is still worth reading and outlines very well the broad consequences of possible Turkish accession to the Union if , one day , Turkey meets all the conditions for accession .
We base our work on that concept and it is a very important consideration .
Therefore , we need a constitutional debate and , in time – sooner rather than later – we need to decide on how we reform our structures so that they are more effective and democratic and so that the European Union can have more clout in external relations , in Common Foreign and Security Policy and in preserving the security of its own citizens against international crime and terrorism .
That must be done in the near future , not in the distant future – not in 10 to 15 years , for instance , when Turkey might be able to join – for the sake of Europe , and we need it already for the European Union of 25 or 27 Member States .
Mr President , it is now 13 years since the UN Convention on Biological Diversity was signed , and yet biological diversity on earth is becoming poorer and poorer .
Globally , the major factor causing the impoverishment of diversity is land use which changes the natural environment to make it more profitable .
As a result of the deterioration in ecosystems , their function and the free services they provide for humans , such as the production of clean water and the maintenance of the hydrological cycle , carbon binding , the pollination of edible plants and the recycling of nutrients , could be very adversely affected .
We therefore share the same clear desire : we want to halt the impoverishment of nature .
Where , however , will the wisdom be found to embark on effective ways of doing so ?
Nature itself is infinitely productive , creative and even extravagant , but at the same time efficient and practical .
We need the same sort of wisdom – but also an unbiased approach – to be able to overcome the difficulties that lie ahead .     . – Mr President , there is broad consensus on the need to strengthen international environmental management .
For this reason , we need real results from the forthcoming UN Conference of Parties regarding biological diversity in the EU.
In order to ensure that the Convention has the widest possible impact , it is essential that it should be implemented effectively in the various policy areas , and that it is compatible with other international agreements on the environment and that they can all be coordinated together .
The biggest problem for effective implementation , however , is the insufficient number of indicators describing biological diversity .
The Commission needs to work hard to produce these indicators .
Mr President , there is an old Swahili saying : ‘Never stand between a river and a hippopotamus’ .
On behalf of my group and myself , I support each and every line .
We are one big family .
Let us stick to that basic line .
Thirdly , let us try to activate the consumers and remember that the money we are allocating for consumer policy is really not that much : EUR 40 million per year , which is 0.03 % of the total budget .
The wording is strong , of course , but this is an unfortunate reflection of reality .
Jewish communities and Christian churches have become targets of physical and spiritual terrorism at the hands of the Grey Wolves , and the matter calls for international attention .     Mr President , I would like to make three points .
The Commission is coming forward with this at a very opportune time , when there is an atmosphere of nationalism and protectionism .
As a matter of fact , unlike many of the strategies that you have provided before , Mr Barroso – I would call them ‘nato’ : no action talk only – this one has a lot of action .
You call this document – not necessarily very aptly – ‘boosting trust through action’ .
The second point is that I agree with the focus on communication .
The paper that you put forward on European communication is quite good .
It was about a directive on electrical appliances : if you take the appliance back to a store , it must be recycled .
However , it is this type of communication that we really need to get rid of .
Everything that is bad comes out of the EU , everything that is good comes from the Member States .
Mr President , Commissioner , President-in-Office of the Council , we know the large oil companies ’ forecasts .
It is a well-known fact that there are no longer any major oil deposits in the EU countries and the gas in our region will also be used up over the course of the next 10 years .
The EU wants to satisfy all of the growth in its energy needs by using gas .
The development of the liquefaction of gas will aggravate the situation , favourable to the EU countries , whereby the majority of the world’s gas reserves are on the Eurasian continent at the end of pipeline connections .
Our group supports the Commission in its search for alternatives .
Finally , let me say a word about ‘European solutions’ .
The reason is obvious : the gap between consumption and supply is so narrow that almost anything can make prices soar .
That , however , is being prevented by an ‘anti-solidarity movement ’ on the part of certain Member States , which has actually grown among the founding members .
They do not permit competition in their own countries , but they buy up energy companies in other countries using this idle money .
They also did the same
