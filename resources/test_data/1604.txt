must finance international cooperation and the promotion of democracy and of human rights .
The President will have our support .
From this perspective , both the Council and Parliament have done an excellent job over the years of work that we have behind us , because they have reconciled their positions to a great extent and have made this instrument much more usable , and have done so , too , in an effort to boost innovation .
Gaza has become a prison in which an entire population is being collectively punished .
It is a situation that is becoming more serious by the day and one that is in danger of turning into an international crisis and , even before that , into a humanitarian crisis .
Hamas militia have abandoned the institutional option and have turned the situation back into one of full-scale terrorism .
Mr President , where there are no rights there are no laws – merely the exercise of force and arbitrary acts .
Let us note the fact that the deputy director was arrested because he was considered to be responsible for this abduction .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , on the eve of the anniversary of the terrorist attacks in London , the fight against terror must certainly remain the main objective of European security strategy and this is a good opportunity to remember it , together with the declaration , which should be loud and clear , that respect for the fundamental human rights of every human being is the other factor that should be included in European security strategy .
I can tell you in advance that at the next Council of Ministers on 24 July , the first to be held under the Finnish Presidency , I will repeat my invitation to the Ministers of Home Affairs in the 25 Member States to continue to collaborate with the temporary Parliamentary committee .
I want to reflect on the reform of the so-called secret services , a reform that comes under national competences , but which I think could benefit from broader debate .
Two examples : until now they have refused to insert two statements by Mr Solana and Mr de Vries because they both said things that were not to the liking of the committee and that were not satisfactory to the Left ; they declared that they had no knowledge of any breach of the law by European Member States in their cooperation with the CIA .
Just a few days ago , following its Guantánamo judgment , the Supreme Court of the United States told us that , between 2001 and 2003 , more than half of the prisoners in Guantánamo were taken there from Afghanistan , which means that Europe was the place of transit for over two hundred prisoners , European airports were used for stopovers , and US and NATO bases in Europe were used as outposts .
The head of the Italian intelligence service , Dr Pollari , either lied to our committee or did not know about the activities of his deputy ; each possibility is equally serious .
As for the events in Italy , I would like to highlight a few points .
In the first place , the Italian Government and the security services organisation have always stated , at all parliamentary sittings , that they had no connection whatsoever with the events leading to the capture of Abu Omar and so far nobody has been able to prove the contrary .
Finally , it would be a good idea to remember that , in five years of centre-right government in Italy , there were no terrorist attacks , but rather many attempts were foiled .
I can tell you that I had already thought about this and as early as last February I suggested that this dialogue should begin at expert level , and it has now begun .
I think that this question , which I have answered several times before the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , may well gain Mr Catania a mention in some headline in the Italian newspapers , but I would have thought that the obligation to tell the truth to this Parliament would have imposed on him the same duty as it does on me : to remember that the government at that time formally denied any knowledge of the Abu Omar case and did so without there being any proof to the contrary .
I think that this must be prevented from happening in the name of the credibility and the very future of Europe .     Mr President , Mr  Frattini , Minister Lehtomäki , ladies and gentlemen , I think that we should be very worried about the red tape that binds together many of the arguments and debates that we have in this Chamber .
Unlike the PNR affair , which , as we were correctly reminded by Mr Lambrinidis , involved a transfer from a private airline directly to a US public body , here the transfer was between two private parties .
This is the third aspect that I think should be examined .
Within the same political agreement package , we are planning agreements for the readmission of illegal immigrants .
This will help to prevent people travelling under false identities .
This will have two immediate results , the first being that we will be able to implement the visa facilitation agreements and , simultaneously , the readmission agreements , by 2007 , therefore over a very short period of time .
This is a political step forwards of definite importance and today we have been asked to implement the action plan .
We must not forget that whatever happens within the borders of each State has repercussions in other States , hence the mechanism for mutual consultation and communication .
First , a challenge that is both global and European .
