Mr President , talking about food is not very easy these days .
As regards the report we drew up last year with the Commission , we will have to think very carefully about those issues , because I do not think a consumer who is buying honey is immediately aware of whether it is honey produced in beehives or filtered honey , even if the label is clear .
As our task is to be impartial and we need to produce legislation that is comprehensible to European citizens , perhaps further thought is necessary over the next few months .
Report ( A5-0272/2001 ) by Mr Nisticò , on behalf of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive setting standards of quality and safety for the collection , testing , processing , storage , and distribution of human blood and blood components and amending Council Directive 89/381/EEC [COM(2000 ) 816 - C5-0034/2001 - 2000/0323(COD ) ]
I am in Venice , the most beautiful city in the world !
This excellent , spot-on , comprehensive report by my friend Mr Nisticò is therefore very welcome , and I have voted for it .
Those are the reasons , in short , that lead me to support the report in full and consequently to vote for it .
That will be of interest in a very short time - I hope - to all the countries that have asked to join the European Union , the twelve states which are to become members of the Union and which I hope will become members as soon as possible , but it occurs to me to say this to Mr Andria : ' Mr Andria , we are correcting the balances of European countries , but why can you not succeed in finding a system that allows pensioners to correct their own balances of payments ? '
On the one hand , those who say that the result obtained there was the best achievable under the present circumstances , are correct .
In order to keep Japan and Australia on board , more has now been paid than was demanded by America last year .
It is this code that has been approved this morning .
It has managed to do so as the code adopted contains significant new elements , the importance of which we will gradually discover .
Well , Mr President , at last the dream that Mr Söderman had in my dream has actually come true with the approval of this directive .
( The sitting was suspended at 1.22 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
It will take at least six months or even more for definite replies to come in , frequently stamped on the closing date , sometimes using the competition rules which always seem to deny the particular characteristics of mountain agriculture .
The second time , fifteen years later , I myself had the honour and the duty of bringing the problems of the mountains to this House , with my report on a new strategy for mountain regions , approved on 23 October 1998 .
Some mountain farmers are over 60 .
That is a dire statistic for the future of the mountains .
In fact , the sense of the committee ' s work and , obviously , the sense of the amendments which have been tabled is that the costs of planting vineyards in lowland areas and on mountains should be compared with the costs of hill vineyards .
We are fortunate in that the economic and social structure of our countries is strong and resilient .
I invite you , therefore , to reflect upon yesterday ' s tragedy .
Our empathy with the suffering victims , with the pain of their families and the pain of the entire American people at difficult times such as this is no less than the expression of our total commitment to preserving the unique nature of the human race .
It is a faint chance , I know , but it is vital that we do not let it go .
We owe it to all those who are combating terrorism and fundamentalism in the world .
I would also point out that part of the influx of billions of dollars of funding dispensed every year to Muslim charities and aid organisations is ultimately used to finance fundamentalist terrorism .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I have listened to a great many sound proposals and seen that there is some convergence too .
However , there is still a complex issue to be resolved in international legal systems or , if you prefer , international law : the attitude to be taken by institutions such as the European Union or even the United Nations to States which tolerate and collaborate with terrorist groups .
Starting with Parliament , our institutions must play a prominent role in the coming weeks and months .
That is why we attach great importance to Russia and China ' s declarations and see the positions of Yasser Arafat and the Israeli government in taking certain decisions which facilitate encouraging steps towards peace in the Middle East as positive .
I too feel that we must establish very close cooperation with the United States and form an extensive world-wide alliance of all the countries that wish to be part of it to combat terrorism .
Finally , Europol and Eurojust must , together , become effective European tools , concentrating on enhancing the European corpus juris and thereby creating a basic legal reference framework which will serve as the basis for European civil , penal and administrative law .
Data on per capita income are no longer sufficient to assess individuals ' opportunities for access in the European regions ; we need much more : we need indicators which measure the degree of access to resources , indicators which measure the level
