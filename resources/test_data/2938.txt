applied on 9.2.2000 not run counter to economic growth ?
Right then , a fellow MEP has just given me the session news about the debate we had yesterday on the Ludford report , and I am disappointed to note that it makes no mention of the statement I made on behalf of our Group .
Madam President , Commissioner , it will come as no surprise to you that I am not satisfied .
Every scientist in the world , including the USA , has established over recent years that noise makes people ill .
Once we have all this , then I should like to see it go through the general assembly of the International Civil Aviation Authority , the ICAO , in September .
We should not begin the legislative procedure under the slogan " suspend " but under the slogan "adaptation to new , jointly-agreed standards " .
This will certainly be in the interest of both sides .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we face an enormous challenge with the budget for the year 2001 .
Parliament sets particular store by this .
What we need in order to finance the measures referred to is flexibility .
What are the challenges of Activity Based Budgeting ?
We suggest that we make provision for new posts in certain areas , but only where absolutely necessary .
We are calling for sustainable financing for civil dialogue and for the non-governmental organisations involved in it , in order to support their important role as the voice of the disadvantaged .
In the first year in which the full budgetary procedure comes to fruition , we are all bound to be highly enthusiastic .
We cannot have a situation in which they promise so much and then come and say , take the money we need from the most needy .
We must therefore expect future intergovernmental conferences to substantiate how this is to be done .
Today in question time I asked the Commission how many jobs are lost if manufacturing plants making products which cannot be exported because they are banned in Europe are closed down .
In my opinion , setting the priorities like this is the best way of starting the debate on a budgetary year .
I think that , on balance , the Lisbon Summit was a success for the European Union because everyone agreed that we now need to take huge steps to promote information and communications technologies and that considering how account can be taken of this priority in the budget should be a matter of common concern .
I should like to point out in this context that EUR 4.5 billion was channelled to the regions from the budget of the European Union between 1991 and 1999 .
I should perhaps come back to the budgetary procedure for the budgetary year 2000 .
These demands can be succinctly summarised : children are no less deserving of protection because their home country denies them the necessary protection , and there is all the more reason not to turn a blind eye to incidents within the European Union .
This is also an explanation of the fact that numerous proposed amendments were rejected by my group .
This protection must be guaranteed in both theory and practice .
Companies must assume liability for damage to consumers without fault .
The Commission should consider if the directive should not be extended to commercial goods .
The second point is that we tend to polarise , and that causes problems .
We need a much higher proportion of primary energy used .
My third comment also concerns a point at which the resolution does not comply with the Treaty .
We certainly have no lack of reports .
Not radically degressive perhaps , otherwise there is no end result , but it must show a downward trend in order to ensure that the best technologies are used , because there is constant technical progress even with renewable sources of energy .
I also think that research and development in this area need greater support .
Now , we must act .
Bearing in mind the statements by both institutions , we shall make decisions next week on the following issues .
What will the Council and the Commission do , and how will they deal with those Member States of the European Union who are spying on their partners in the Union in order - as , in fact , has been admitted - to protect their economic well-being ?
We stated clearly at the time that we are in favour of biotechnology and approve of the opportunities it presents , but we want to see clear , ethically based limits .
Clearly , we must quickly create a route to independent patent jurisdiction which is open to everyone .
We must vehemently oppose this commercialisation of human genes and these flagrant violations of human dignity .
The German must therefore read 'verbrauchende Embryonenforschung ' .
As rapporteur for the discharge of our own institution ' s budget , I would have appreciated it if Mr Sepp√§nen had taken the trouble to cast an eye over my report , which expressly and critically dealt with the issue of the inventory and which was available in all languages to all my colleagues here in the House from 10 February .
The citizens would not understand it if we simply held a debate without then saying what proposed solutions and options the European Union can offer .
I would like to congratulate Mr Kirkhope on his report .
The motivation for this initiative was clearly that all those who wish to make policy for the future must , on the one hand , have the courage to carry out necessary reforms and , on the other , must positively and effectively avail themselves of the opportunities afforded by technological and global development and human resources , all the while taking responsibility for pointing out risks and undesirable developments and for drawing the necessary boundaries
