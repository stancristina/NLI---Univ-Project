When Regulation (EC ) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council , regarding public access to information about the EU institutions , was negotiated , it was decided that the European Parliament 's access to sensitive documents should be covered by a separate Interinstitutional Agreement between Parliament and the Council to enable the European Parliament to honour its commitments under Article 21 EC of the Treaty on European Union .
The agreement limits the right conferred on all members - and the public - by Regulation No 1049 , in that it creates a group which has special access to information .
An interinstitutional agreement in this sensitive area should be combined with strict confidentiality rules ( compatible with those of NATO ) .
We have today voted against the draft Interinstitutional Agreement concerning access by Parliament to sensitive information of the Council in the field of security and defence policy .
On order to achieve increased openness and equality , there should moreover be more permanent members on the committee , and at the same time a given number of members should be able to be elected in accordance with the procedure laid down in the draft agreement .
The registration procedure for generic medicinal products needs to be simplified , so that it is possible to place generic medicinal products on the market directly upon expiry of the ten-year period following initial authorisation of the reference medicinal product .
Patients require reliable information from an independent source .
The report proposes measures to improve direct access to the Court of First Instance .
The report adopts a rigid stance on changes to the Charter 's horizontal clauses .
Having a charter which has the force of primary law opens the way , in principle , for secondary legislation ( regulations and directives ) based on the charter .
Mr President , the dread and panic which terrorism spreads is the same regardless of whether the perpetrator is a lone sniper in Washington or large-scale networks such as Al-Qaeda .
The attacks in New York and Bali made it clear to everyone that the fight against terrorism must be carried out at global level , in the form of police and judicial cooperation , intelligence and investigations .
However , it is also important to engage in long-term , preventive cooperation to eradicate , or at least minimise , the causes of terrorism .
Trade , aid and cooperation in international organisations are also important .
We must , however , bear in mind that the chief target of the terrorists is the open society .
It is scandalous that the prisoners at the Guantanamo Bay base are still in legal limbo .
If we do , the terrorists will win hands down .
It is our opinions on methods for combating terrorism which perhaps differ .
The Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy has made its contribution by delineating the main instruments which the EU has at its disposal for the prevention of conflicts , for example the development of democracy , and also trade and diplomacy .
It is extremely important , therefore , that Parliament upholds the United Nations Charter , and that the right of a state under attack to defend itself is only legitimate if confirmation is given or a decision taken by the UN Security Council .
This applies to smaller states in particular .
I should like sincerely to thank Mr Haarder and the Danish Presidency for that detailed and excellent reply .
Firstly , is it conceivable that , in the relatively near future , Ukraine could be offered a special agreement , which could be an Eastern European variant of a special economic relationship , that is to say , a form of Eastern European EEA Agreement ?
In addition , we must help the developing countries to develop effective strategies for the conservation of wild species .
As you know , in September the Commission proposed guidelines for the Community with a view to the Conference in Santiago .
I am delighted to note that the Commission 's viewpoint differs only slightly from the views expressed by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .
In the light of this , I concur with your support for the inclusion of basking shark and whale shark in Appendix II to CITES.
Even though it only covers a limited number of members , the catch documentation scheme introduced by CCAMLR contains provisions very similar to those of CITES.
I can also confirm that the Commission opposes the resumption of the commercial trade in ivory until it has been clearly demonstrated that this trade will not lead to greater protection of poachers or have a negative impact on the status of elephant populations .
It is undeniable that there is a large number of African elephants in several southern African countries , where the populations are currently covered by Appendix II .
Finally , I wish to inform the European Parliament that , in addition to the points you raise in your resolution , a large number of further proposals has been presented to the organisers of the Conference , which would have positive consequences for the conservation of species and which have the support of the Commission .
One is a decision to ratify this Convention on behalf of the European Community ; the other the regulation required in order to implement the Convention in the Community .
The Commission considers that the proposals are well balanced and that they will contribute to the achievement of the Community 's objective of improving the protection of human health and the environment in importing countries - especially developing countries - from hazardous chemicals , without preventing the smooth application of the Convention .
