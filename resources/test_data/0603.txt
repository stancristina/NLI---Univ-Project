world .
When elections were then called there a few years ago we hoped that they would lead to democratic development .
As everyone knows , events took a very different turn .
A dialogue is now being conducted which still does not include all the parties in Algeria .
Madam President , the Council of Ministers is currently holding discussions with Iran on a number of issues , including Salman Rushdie .
We in the Liberal Group hope that Parliament , like us , will oppose anything which Iran can interpret as any kind of recognition - silent , implicit or indirect - of Khomeini 's fatwa against Salman Rushdie .
It is also good that the conclusions mention how important it is that this should be seen as support for the peace process .
In this connection I would also like to mention that it will soon be ten years since the researcher Mordechai Vanunu was imprisoned after having spoken out about Israel 's nuclear research programme .
This research appears harmless but may quite well be developed and used in areas which are far from being in our interests .
Mr President , I am very glad that this first annual report from the Commission has finally reached Parliament - better late than never .
Against this background , it is regrettable that the report does not live up to the expectations raised when one reads Article 130p of the Treaty .
This annual report from the Commission thus confirms the conclusion of the Swedish report on that point .
Finally , I hope that the Commission will take to heart what is in this report from Mr Lange , which we in the Green Group will be supporting , and that the Commission will learn from its experience and , next time , present a better annual report .
A reduction in the top rate of taxation is a further threat to public infrastructures in countries where the tax is a significant source of revenue .
In this case , other countries ' goods are penalized in favour of those of the country imposing the tariff , and the relative advantages of trade do not benefit the consumers .
Every country in a democratic system should be able to decide on its own taxes .
We have a situation of serious budget deficits in our Member States .
Imposing this upper limit is tantamount to putting an upper limit on public services .
Mr President , let me begin by thanking Mr Farassino for the excellent work he has done on this question of harmonizing the rules for driving licences in the EU.
This was also referred to by the European Court of Justice in a judgment dating back to 1978 .
The Commission has now put forward further proposals on these lines .
In my opinion , such checks will be eased still further by the fact that the harmonized coding system will also be applied in the EEA countries .
This type of information can in future also be included in an international , harmonized coding system by entering , in coded form , the illness a particular person suffers from or the medicine on which he or she vitally depends .
This could save a great many lives .
This applies to Amendments Nos 3 , 4 and 7.
Yet on average 230 vessels are lost each year , claiming thousands of lives .
Apart from the improvements to vessel standards that the report addresses , the risk of human error must also be minimized .
How then is it possible to extend such a system before it has been properly reformed ?
There is a need for clarity in the action of politicians .
What is Commissioner Monti prepared to do ?
Our Parliament is also demanding more participation in decision-making .
Not everything can be solved by politicians , not everything can be solved at European level .
But the red parties propose rights which cannot be upheld , for which no-one knows whether resources can be found and for which there is no legal basis .
But anyone who violates the wish-lists of the left risks nothing .
These political wish-lists are nothing more than a bid to exploit human rights for selfish political purposes , a means of securing the release by the back door of economic resources which will not gain approval at national level .
If Parliament is to present these annual reports at all , the red parties should ponder on a couple of sayings we have in Sweden that go something like : ' true mastery lies in moderation ' and 'reach out for everything , gain nothing ' .
It covers everything from the right to life , through condemnation of the death penalty , torture and violence against detainees and prisoners , to the right to asylum .
This can create a fertile ground for the spread of the very racism and xenophobia which we want to prevent and which is one of the main themes of this report .
The most important concern of the amendments in my view is that ways are now being proposed to stimulate and develop inland waterways in all Member States , not least my own country , Sweden , which has a lot of water and many lakes .
Regeneration programmes of various kinds and incentives are important if this route is really to be taken and if the volume of road haulage traffic is to be reduced .
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy approves of teleworking , but we are not told anything about the risk of weak negotiating positions or the lack of creative contact with work colleagues .
We must shield our children from violence and pornography and at the same time provide high-grade entertainment and information .
Support from the EU and the Member States must be improved .
