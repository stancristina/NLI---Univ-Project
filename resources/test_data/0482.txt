of democracy and speak out against the continued use of capital punishment in Asian countries .
Air quality is a major health problem and when , more than six months ago , I started to look into it in depth , I was shocked by just how great it turned out to be .
First of all stricter standards ; secondly , that more attention be given to implementation ; and , thirdly , action to address the problem of air pollution at source .
PM2.5 is therefore a better measure , although the way in which the Commission has fleshed it out is very disappointing .
Only four Member States are in full compliance with the limit values as specified in the present directive .
It is up to the Commission to ensure that these are observed , and that is also necessary , because air pollution is a cross-border problem .
Only adequate efforts warrant exceptions .
That is why the Committee on the Environment wishes to include in the directive Article 30A , which demands source policy by 2010 .
The aim of this legislation – and I am mainly focusing on the draft directive – is therefore commendable , and I am particularly supportive of Mr Krahmer’s attempts to make it as workable as possible .
There is phenomenal opposition to this policy in the Commission , and , in fact , also in this House .
I should now like to turn to Commissioner Dimas .
Mrs Corbey , you are in favour of strict and new source policy .
We should stop playing politics in that way .
That is putting the future of our cities at risk .
I only wish to say that I support the conclusions of the Ferber report .
I am absolutely convinced that this is true and I totally agree .
I can only say that in this process and in that committee of inquiry , Mr Ferber has played a star role , and all credit to him for that .
Parliament may have its own view , but is not in a position to change anything .
A special working party was set up , in which , I believe , we all worked very hard and very well together , and in which we tried to give Mr Ferber maximum support .
It is a voluntary pension fund , one that is managed by the managers .
Accordingly , whilst we Dutch Christian Democrats subscribe to the thrust of the Ferber report with regard to spending of the 2004 Parliament budget , as prepared and adopted in the Committee on Budgetary Control , I should nevertheless like to make a few observations , which I see in isolation from the Ferber report , not least because he has done an excellent job with regard to Strasbourg .
I am delighted with the knowledge that first of all , the importance of the availability of services of general interest is underlined and secondly , that the common position on the Services Directive has been confirmed , namely that it is up to the Member States to determine what services of general interest are .
The public sector was set to remain safe from Bolkestein , but that may have been no more than a Pyrrhic victory ; after all , it is only now that services of general interest are being defined .
To curb government interference is a commendable objective in areas where citizens can be expected to display self-sufficiency and responsibility .
Codecision is the right way to deal with these political issues .
For the vote on this report , again I state that we have agreed to disagree on the issue of which instruments would be preferable .
We must , above all , provide room for diversity , and refrain from freezing this diversity in a horizontal regulatory framework .
For the first time , this House is even adopting a weaker position than the Council .
If the Council does not offer enough in the way of counterweight against this weakening measure , the Commission will have no choice but to withdraw the proposal .     .
This report is about more than rubberstamping the bill pertaining to the 2004 financial year .
That reflects what is being said in the Dutch media and the opinion which the public has held on this matter for years .
This House has insisted on Romania having the right to defer , whilst for Bulgaria , the application of that possibility was left entirely in the hands of the Council .
It is unfortunate that a majority could not be found in this House to back these demands , although a majority did express concern about the use of a dangerous toxin in mining preparations in Rosia Montana .
I should like to extend a warm welcome to both countries , but to Romania in particular .
Instead , the progress and dynamism present in both countries is now being drawn on in order to get what is left of the accession process out of the way in a thorough manner and to clear the desks as quickly as possible .
We had expected at the start of the negotiations in 2004 , when we made a decision , that the impressive reforms of 2002-2004 would continue .
Although it was a big improvement , some articles raised doubts – Article 301 , first and foremost .
Give back the properties to the religious minorities and change the proposal of the law on foundation so that if they cannot be given back , then at least there is a good compensation for the minority churches .
It was agreed at the start of negotiations that there would be no formal recognition ceremony by Turkey of Cyprus but that there would be an Ankara Protocol as a kind of normalisation of relations .
