One major benefit the Commission foresees in integrating the EDF into the European budget is that there would no longer be these separate negotiations on the funding ratios for each new Fund .
This amounts to a positive statement , one that must also be viewed in the context of the commitments made at Monterey .
That should then give you some kind of yardstick for judging the views of this House on the very sensitive question of the liberal professions .     – Mr President , President of the Commission , Commissioner , this debate reminds me a little of the debate we held on so-called services of general interest and competition law .
I see professional codes of conduct as essential for guaranteeing the impartiality , competence , integrity and responsibility of the members of each professional body and for protecting consumers .
The less taxes companies have to pay , the more they will be willing to invest in Europe .
The President of the Commission and , I believe , the President-in-Office of the Council , have talked about how important it is to do something for education and research .
It is the top priority for these six months .     Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , we should indeed not underestimate the significance of the next Brussels summit , or the effect that it will have .
Reference has already been made to the situation in the Middle East , and it will be further discussed tomorrow .
After eighteen months of negotiation , a great and historic consensus was achieved .
We must , however , bear in mind that we do not possess the expert knowledge that some institutions or groups have , and such expertise needs to be used – by which I mean not only the giving of advice , but also having the opportunity to co-determine implementing legislation on the basis of laws passed by this House .
The quality of European lawmaking is so important an issue that we should not treat it lightly .
No longer must we make declarations ; now is the time for us to at last take action .
By way of contrast , I would like to know whether we would organise debates in their current form if it were your money !
We have done this because our group stands for the social market economy , because we back the Lisbon objectives , and because social cohesion is not incompatible with economic success ; on the contrary , it is contingent upon it .
The third point is one that must be faced head-on – the issue of the way in which the provisions on mergers are being brought closer to those in the Cartels Regulation .
Let me quote : ‘has a tangible and lasting influence on competition ’ .
Let it be emphasised from the outset that this proposal by the Commission is a good one .
We also attached particular importance to the practicability of what we were proposing in very many individual cases , of which the particular problems of tunnels in cities may be taken as representative .
I wanted , of course , also to extend warm thanks to Mr Rack for his report and for the work he has done .
I do , nevertheless , have five comments to make .
In this process , vitally significant safety aspects have not been disregarded ; on the contrary , it has been possible to extend them , for example , by taking into account the safety needs of people with disabilities , which makes sense and is – and , I think , in view of this being the European Year of People with Disabilities – positively necessary .
It is in order to compensate for this loss that the EU has concluded fisheries agreements with third states .
My concluding remarks can be relatively brief .
This must be made very clear .
Now , of course , the development must continue .
The question is this : What contribution can the European Community make ?
It is an established fact that bathing waters have become substantially cleaner right across Europe .
This is about the exhaust emissions from construction machinery , excavators , locomotives and inland waterway vessels , and I believe that it is clear to many members of the public that we have to do something about them .
We have agreed that performance once the test cycle is completed must not result in vastly greater emissions into the atmosphere , but that close attention must be paid to ensure that it remains within reasonable bounds in relation to the test cycle .
It is quite clear , though , that if people want , in the long term , to run these large motors – which are not 80 horse-power jobs , but check in at between 600 and 1000 kW , and have a correspondingly massive output – then they will have to put their hands in their pockets to do so ; they must realise that they will have to do that in future , and they must make preparations .
These , though , produce pollutants , and it is on these that we want to impose rules .
Without wishing to tread on anyone’s toes , my second question is whether the country for which the ships were destined possesses the necessary infrastructures .
I would like to thank Mrs de Sarnez for carrying out her work with such determination and so much drive .
EUR 230 million alone will certainly not suffice .
I agree with other Members that the Council’s proposal of EUR 180 million is completely unacceptable .
I think that it is for the European Union to give a visible impulse in this area , thus starting a chain reaction and again making education a top priority in the Member
