a country which lies at major intersections is even more vulnerable to this .
We need , as a matter of urgency , to create a European single market in that respect too , and this will only be possible if we harmonise trans-European , i .e . international , as well as national traffic .
In percentage terms , trains have certainly not retained their share in transport .
Rail systems develop extremely slowly .
Take , for example , the night train from Amsterdam to Milan which will be introduced from 28 May .
We should , however , qualify one key point concerning a matter of principle .
Both the Commission ' s recommendation and the resolution claim high economically sustainable growth as the highest good and pursue this remorselessly .
Only since 1999 have both government expenditure and revenue fallen .
In my opinion , the key conclusion that was reached at that summit was that the European Council will itself adopt an active , guiding and coordinating role .
He proposes the drawing up of a single annual report on the economic and social state of the Union , and one set of annual guidelines for sustainable growth , employment and social cohesion .
Why did the Commission not take these skeletons in the cupboard into consideration during the assessment ?
We have an agreement with all political groups in this Parliament that we would accelerate proceedings for this directive .
It is now crucial that these sectors can , at long last , look forward to a regulation so that they too come under the scope of the directive .
Mr President , I would like to make a brief comment concerning Sweden .
The Greeks have produced a fantastic achievement .
These countries , however , are making a mess of their own responsibilities vis-à-vis the currency and vis-à-vis the European citizen , let alone their own citizens .
Businesses within the European Union have become 25 % cheaper for the United States to buy .
Paragraph 2 adds , in summary , that undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest shall be subject to the rules contained in this Treaty .
In short , what is the origin of investments in the commercial field ?
In the report on the adoption of the single currency by Greece , I blame the governments for not doing what needs to be done .
Mr President , despite this discussion in Parliament concerning the changes which the Commission would like to make to the directive on the transparency of financial relations between Member States and public undertakings , we will not have much of a say in it because it will be the Commission , and the Commission only , that will make decisions without further involving the European Parliament or the Council , much to our regret .
I am , therefore , of the opinion that the IGC should apply the normal legislative procedure for codecision by the Council and Parliament to general competition policy legislation .
However , a very broad strategy will not get us much further .
When will the civilised world finally realise that countries which maintain banking secrecy are accessory to huge crimes at the expense of the poorest population groups .
It is a year in which , based on the concept of the biblical Holy Year , we need to think seriously about relieving the debt of the poorest of the poor .
The reason for this is firstly that the conditions tied in with the debt relief are such that only few countries qualify .
That is a disastrous situation because we often ask ourselves why our development aid does not work .
The countries concerned should not be at war or participate in wars , and an agreed proportion of the budget must really be spent on social schemes for the poorest citizens , and must be invested in education , health care and social security .
As early as the late eighties , UNICEF stated that the rich obtained the loans in the Third World and the poor were saddled with the debts , and UNICEF was right .
According to Oxfam , there are 19 000 children who die daily in the developing countries as a result of the debt burden and as an indirect result , admittedly , of the IMF programmes which require certain countries to cut down their health care expenditure by one third .
It is making sure that the funds of the European taxpayer are not misused to fund wars - crazy wars - in Africa .
Land reform is necessary , of course .
But the cooperation according to Lomé cannot continue if Mugabe also renders elections impossible .
I think that this is vital because those who are not kindly disposed towards the Mugabe regime , those in opposition , will clearly need protection .
We must avoid this at all costs .
The sector is growing by 10 % annually and thus helping create employment .
I would appreciate it if the technicians could do something about it .
The forthcoming enlargement of the Union makes this all the more pressing .
It appears that commercialisation , i .e . injecting expertise into a product , seems to be much more successful in the United States than it is in Europe .
Infrastructures do not innovate , neither do electronic networks , although they are a prerequisite .
Finally , I would like to state that Europe needs a joint research policy which accommodates both applied and fundamental research in various technical specialist fields and which takes into account the fact that innovations often emerge at the interface of different scientific disciplines .
This is true for the Member States and regions , some of whose percentage levels are shamefully low
