has been increasing recognition that Europe must promote international standards of respect for human rights , for instance in the international criminal tribunals on Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda , the agreement on the statute of the international criminal court , the Pinochet case , the intervention in Kosovo to stop ethnic cleansing - all these things have been developing momentum .
Saying that we will not allow our citizens to sexually exploit children abroad fits into that pattern , and the part of Mrs Klamt ' s report that talks of how we must insist that double standards are unacceptable is very well put and particularly valuable .
It is not acceptable that our citizens should behave abroad in a way that they would not behave at home .
Secondly , this report makes a contribution to police and judicial cooperation in the European Union .
This is a strong example where those Euro-sceptics who resist cooperation in this field are wrong .
It is only by joint across-the-board action that we can tackle this issue , not least by agreeing to extra-territorial application of criminal laws .
Approximation and mutual recognition of national criminal provisions , which is not the same as harmonisation , will be of the utmost utility , as will cooperation through police forces and Europol , insisting all the time , as the Parliament does , on adequate parliamentary and judicial scrutiny .
So I congratulate Mrs Klamt for a very valuable report and I hope it will continue to be built on in future .
Mr President , I would like to welcome what is a very well considered report , which invites us to stand back and take stock before embarking on further legislation in this field - a refreshing welcome from the tendency of this House sometimes to rush , or to be pushed to rush , at complex legislation .
I would particularly like to focus my comments on the issues raised by this report on the further harmonisation of private law .
In our enthusiasm we sometimes forget what a sensitive subject the harmonisation of private law is ; it touches the national legal traditions in our Member States , legal traditions born of our differing histories and cultures of separate nations and jurisdictions .
Professor MacCormick will be acutely aware of this in Scotland , with its own legal heritage .
I am not in any way opposed to further harmonisation , it can be helpful to the good functioning of the internal market , but imposed legislative harmonisation needs to be carefully and openly considered , or we may find we have left our citizens behind in this project .
The traditional push towards harmonisation has been the internal market to which we can now add the aspirations of Tampere for a single area of European justice .
But harmonisation must respect subsidiarity - we have no need to rush towards uniformity of civil law in this area of product liability .
We should be aware that uniformity can stifle innovation and prevent adaptation to local or national circumstances and problems .
It is a truism that European law has been able to benefit from the ability to draw on rich comparative material of varying legal traditions in our different Member States .
It would be dangerous to stifle this by uniformity .
Let me suggest that the aspirations of Tampere can be better met in the public law area of the intended Charter of Fundamental Rights than by further imposed legislation which harmonises our private law traditions .
Research seems to show that our traditions are tending to converge slowly .
Let us perhaps be prepared to assist and guide that convergence and respect the conditionality of the further harmonisation which is integral to Professor MacCormick ' s proposals .
Mr President , I would like to join my colleagues in giving a warm welcome to Professor MacCormick ' s very realistic report .
In considering the whole issue of product liability we have to say that the current directive appears to have functioned well .
There is not a great deal of evidence that consumers are at the moment being seriously disadvantaged .
I would argue quite strongly that we have achieved a very fair and reasonable balance of interests .
I want to pick up the point made by my colleague Mr Wuermeling that we must take particular care about development risks in the environment within which we now find ourselves .
It was a crucial issue at the Lisbon Summit and new product innovation is one of the key competitive aspects of European business .
If our regulations on product liability stifle competitiveness and innovation , I suggest that consumers will be at a major disadvantage as well .
Consumers will be the ones to lose out , if a flow of competitive and innovative products is stifled .
So let me echo Mr MacCormick : there is a need for much more clearly-based factual evidence before we make changes to this legislation .
Mr President , I would like to reiterate the thanks to the rapporteur for the extremely cooperative manner in which he has embarked upon this important report and I am pleased to participate in the intimate gathering of renewable fanatics so late at night .
Three points - firstly , the whole issue of a level playing field .
It seems to us essential that if we are going to give renewable energies the breathing space and the momentum that they merit , it is right to try and aim for a level playing field .
That requires , above and beyond everything else , downward pressure on the unacceptably high and legally dubious levels of subsidies which continue to flow to fossil energy sources in the European Union , notably , but not excusably , the coal industry in a number of large Member States
