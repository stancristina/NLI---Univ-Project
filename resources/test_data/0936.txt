These new rules mainly aim to protect consumers from risks associated with the consumption of these products .
Let us start with the question of flexibility for small businesses raised by the last speaker and by numerous other Members of the European Parliament .
A new definition of artisanal small businesses , however , as proposed in the amendment , is not considered necessary .
The Commission can therefore accept Amendments Nos 134 , 141 and 142 .
Amendments Nos 85 and 86 are not accepted , because we believe that they will restrict flexibility without any justification .
The proposal in Amendment No 87 to separate production and control responsibilities within the business is considered particularly constructive .
However , the relevant arrangements must not undermine the system as a whole .
This applies to the serious risks affecting food safety .
I would say that the Commission does , in fact , have a problem with the proposal by the Committee on the Environment proposing that this order be abolished .
My thanks to Mr Schnellhardt and all the members of this committee who helped with this dossier , which is especially important to producers and consumers .
The amendments proposed by the rapporteur of the European Parliament move in a more positive direction than the Commission 's proposals , with the exception of the reference to durum wheat which is , however , regulated under another regulation .
( EL ) The objective of the Commission proposal is to diminish Community production and increase imports from third countries .
The rapporteur 's amendments , although more positive , are ultimately out of kilter with his objective findings about the state of this sector .
It is infuriating that the quota granted in compensation for the reduction in target prices is increased by a larger percentage in the developed and a smaller percentage in the less developed countries .
That belief led to customs union , to its being proclaimed a candidate country , but not to democratisation .
The repression of its people continued , with the gaols full of political detainees in inhumane conditions .
DEHAP is about to be banned .
We condemn the hypocritical policy of the ?U , which is based above all on serving big interests and we stand by those fighting , under harsh conditions , for democracy , peace and social progress in Turkey , certain that radical change will come as their fight develops .
Within the framework of a clearly neo-colonialist policy , the European Parliament is calling on the Balkan countries to come into line with euro-unification and euro-Atlantic standards , to set integration into the EU as their sole prospect , to change their political structure and their internal legislation and to condemn their past .
It is being promoted as a coordination procedure on a voluntary basis and as a mechanism for exchanging experience ; however , the fact that it does not require legislation at Community level makes it particularly opaque and , consequently , ideal for promoting anti-grass roots policies or policies which fall outside the competences of the ?U.
For these reasons , the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against it , just as we voted against the motion by the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport .
The Presidency is keeping quiet about the provocative activities of the US representative in Cuba where , as he himself admits , he is recruiting agents by paying them millions of dollars to turn against their socialist homeland .
Complicity ?
The Communist Party of Greece is opposed to the introduction of a European constitution because it will strengthen the imperialist ? U at the expense of the peoples and for the benefit of the exploiters .
The abolition of the revolving presidency , the composition of the Commission , the cutback in unanimous decision-making and the definition of the qualified majority show that this is about redistributing power for the benefit of the strong and handing over more national sovereignty to the imperialist , Euro-unifying centre .
We are convinced that the peoples will not be deceived .
Mr President , for Iran the concept of Europe was first formulated , in contradistinction to Asia , in the historic work of Herodotus , when he wrote about the Persians ' attack on Europe , which was then the Greek city states .
I think that we are playing with fire .
I think that we are laying a huge mine under the very efforts by Iranian students with whom , I think , most members sympathise , with the pretexts we are giving the conservative regime to crush their rebellion .
The first is this : just as we are calling on Iran to reply timely , fully and adequately , we want the government of the United States and the British Government to tell us if they found weapons of mass destruction in Iraq , so that we do not wage wars for nothing .
This confirms that the choice to create an EU 'minister for foreign affairs ' is the right choice , but I hope that he will not function later on like Janus who , according to mythology , changed his face to suit the circumstances .
This redefinition is a sine qua non , because the axis of the Union 's strategy must again rest on its relations with the USA .
And an equal footing , in this particular case , means parity .
So-called one-sided threats are completing older procedures and crisis conditions and thus the European Union is obliged de facto to play a new international role .
I believe that we shall do well and that Mr Solana 's proposals will be the first step towards the Union 's subsequently acquiring independence in its relations with all the powers of the world .
