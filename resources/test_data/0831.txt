It sank because there was no observation system for icebergs in those days .
Needless to say , after the sinking of the Titanic , such a system was introduced without delay .
Things are happening fast , in fact they are happening at the speed of light , which is why my group is delighted with the communication from the Commission and with Mr Veltroni' s exhaustive report , which looks into every aspect of these new developments .
It is not Europe ' s business to regulate this , so no artificial protection .
I am calling for a European investment fund to be set up , which will enable the creative producers we have in Europe to at long last enter into real competition with America , in a manner which fully meets with the requirements of the free market .
They was no limit on the extent to which they could be used there , which posed a serious threat , not just to the fish stocks but also to the livelihoods and the food supply of the people in the local area .
All Member State ships should respect an economic twelve-mile exclusion zone .
Clearly this agreement is extremely important to the countries of the south ; after all , the southern fisheries agreements are directly responsible for 13 000 jobs in Spain and Portugal , among others .
It is quite clear that regional elements are going to play a more prominent role .
It is therefore quite astounding that there are still that many obstacles with regard to the free movement of persons and right of residence , especially where temporary contracts , part-time jobs and the unemployed who look for jobs abroad are concerned .
On the other hand , there is a substantial risk of too many plans and programmes being subjected to environmental impact assessments .
As we have already discussed , at the heart of the proposal is , of course , the duty on the part of ships to report and to deliver waste .
Eventually , what mattered most was the fee system , which is , in itself , not unimportant .
In other words , this principle is not very effective in this case .
Small ports will need to make a considerable effort to accommodate this directive in the foreseeable future .
Right until the very end , however , there has been one main contentious issue , namely the ships ' own contributions toward the cost of collecting waste .

Substantial appears to mean 30 % here , but this cannot be made explicit in the text itself .
It would be better if , instead of applying an overall EU solution , this matter could be regulated according to which particular sea was involved .
Meanwhile , the British Government would like to permit therapeutic cloning of embryos for research .
The treatment of the human embryo as a consumer article , supposedly justified by the argument that this is in the name of research , fills me with disgust , especially because there are other ways of cloning stem cells .
Who are we to deny people the right to recovery ?
In 1996 , the Commission proposed the ecological water directive , which did not amount to more than five pages , however .
We now have a substantial legislative document of 60 pages , with 90 pages of appendix .
In the case of the electronic and electrical waste directive , this must be regulated more effectively .
This is needed given the growth in aviation and , along with it , the growth in environmental pollution caused by it .
I believe that the shift from one mode of transport to another which is more environmentally-friendly is of great importance .
