, the use of plants based on genetically altered organisms as food and their use in distributed products should be prohibited , because as yet not enough is known about the consequences of such use .
The report also refers to the transport of animals .
Although labelling of origin is hard to harmonize , the Finnish consumer at least demands information about the method of transport of animals and the geographical origin of produce and , in my opinion , he has the right to do so .
It rather seems to be saying that , if a French gourmet thinks goose liver is a mouth-watering delicacy , he is not thinking very seriously about the interests of animals .
The idea that lobbyists , who are influential in Parliament in many respects , should be required to give an account of their activities annually , is to be supported .
However , the responsibility for directing lobbyists to the straight and narrow path cannot be left solely to the lobbyists themselves .
The Members of Parliament cannot deny that they themselves have a greater responsibility .
The receiving of gifts was forbidden .
But they are much more too .
Because the network system can bypass the democratic system or be out of reach of democracy .
A network is also a means of exercising power : economic , cultural , political and social power .
It will slip away by coming very close , as close as half a metre away even right on top of us .
It will not be possible to elect the people who have power on the network .
This , however , is not enough .
It will be possible to wage information society wars by means of the networks .
People and governments will not be physically damaged in a modern war .
Computer hackers , for example , can be the highwaymen or the fighter pilots of networks .
It is not enough that we in Europe have a high technical level of networks .
I am pleased that , in the discussion in committee , the report 's security policy aspect broadened and became more diverse .
In spite of this , as a member from a neutral Nordic country , I am unable to approve all its details and I cannot give it my support .
With some people , the thought uppermost in their minds is federalist theory and its concomitant objective that the EU should become a great power with a single defence policy and defence .
On the other hand , our security may be endangered by the uncertainties arising from the development of Eastern Europe and particularly Russia .
We can overcome these threats only by tightening pan-European cooperation .
Madam President , the European Union was changed when three non-aligned countries acceded in 1995 .
At the same time those three countries , by accepting the Maastricht Treaty , declared their political alignment to the principles of the Union .
We are looking forward to peaceful collaboration with the Baltic area and with a Russia grappling with the problems of a changeover to democratic and legally binding structures .
Security for all of us is dependent not only upon developments in Russia but also in the Ukraine and Belarus .
Enlargement of the Union is the best means to enhance security .
This said , proposals in the report for enhanced efficiency in peacekeeping and peacemaking missions are welcome and in line with the initiatives taken by the Swedish and Finnish Ministers of Foreign Affairs .
The Tindemans report , despite its many qualities , is a poor compromise .
Peacemaking , for instance , is translated as rauhanhieronta which in English means peace massage .
Madam Chairman , I should like to thank the rapporteur for his thorough work and calm approach to the development aspects of a common security policy at EU level .
The threats which citizens feel to their security are now primarily non-military in nature and relate , among other things , to environmental threats and nuclear safety .
The theoretical difficulty in shaping the future of security policy is of course obvious , because those involved differ widely in their objectives and resources .
A good example of this difficulty is the varying status of the EU countries in their relations with the Western European Union .
Finland and Sweden have proposed in the context of the IGC that the WEU 's role in developing the common foreign and security policy should concentrate on crisis management tasks .
I hope that the very heterogeneity of the parties involved would lead to the terms being defined extremely carefully when talking , for example , of the Baltic region .
This point of view is not , however , uniformly shared .
I hope that Finnish public opinion will also take notice of this debate .
It uses the terms 'waste ' and 'waste water ' when referring to cattle dung and urine .
( Parliament adopted the legislative resolution )
A growing number of people want better quality food produced in a more ethically sustainable way than is the case with present-day high - efficiency farming .
Unfortunately , the regulation on organic farming is too detailed for the widely differing conditions which occur in the Union .
The Greens tried to make it more flexible in many respects , but the enthusiasm for hair-splitting detail won .
In the EU a much shorter transition period is going to be adopted , two years under the Commission proposal , which Parliament would like to shorten still further to one year .
Member States , including Finland , as well as the organic farmers ' organizations , have been very worried about the Commission 's unclear position on this point until now .
Now there is also a desire to add to this structure a common policy on the arms industry
