the supervisors themselves to be subject to supervision , and for the agency in Dublin to be given more autonomous authority to exercise supervision on its own initiative .
We believe it is absolutely essential that an agency of this kind should always fall within the Commission ' s sphere of political responsibility , and always be under the political control of the European Parliament .
I feel there is a need for a broadly based discussion in the public arena about the recycling industry .
Firstly there is the matter of the agency for food safety .
What will the Commission do to stop Member States introducing protectionist measures under the pretext of public health ?
I also have a question about the distribution of competences .
I lend my support to the comments some of my colleagues have made about the scandalous absence of the Council from this debate .
I therefore believe that tests of this kind must take place throughout the European Union .
That is why I also feel that those who take risks with food must be severely punished .
What control does Europe actually have over this and what options does it have as regards imposing penalties ?
I am certainly not in favour of a system along American lines .
In Africa , however , all our worst fears as regards the disease have been realised and exceeded .
The question is , how can we help the African countries to ward off this fate ?
As far as openness is concerned , a lot still has to be asked of African leaders in terms of breaking through traditional African taboos , particularly with regard to speaking out about the dangers of unprotected sex .
Lastly , Madam President , there is the help we need to give the children who have been left orphaned .
We call upon the Commission to boost its programmes for Africa with this theme in mind .
The epidemic there causes more deaths than do armed conflicts on that continent .
Compulsory licensing must not be allowed to lead to people in Africa no longer being able to afford anti-AIDS drugs .
Mr President , the aim of the eleventh ICASA conference in Lusaka was to set in motion a critical evaluation of the priorities and strategies which have been drawn up so far in the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic .
Other speakers in Lusaka also suggested that this is not being made a subject for discussion in all candour , although everyone is aware that the spreading of the HIV virus is due , above all , to promiscuous behaviour .
When people lead promiscuous lives we are not talking about relationships in which respect for the other person as a human being sets the tone .
In addition , I would like to thank the Commission for the preparatory work it has carried out .
Mr President , there is every chance that the EU will fail to meet the objectives relating to the reduction of CO2 emissions .
That is why we intend to vote against the rapporteur ' s proposal on that point and opt for one per cent .
Instead of this , I feel that it would be a much better idea to draw up various incentives measures which will encourage governments and the business community to conclude voluntary agreements , for example .
I therefore hope that energy companies in EU Member States in particular , that have a great deal of experience of projects in the field of energy efficiency , can share their knowledge with these countries and , Commissioner , it is my special hope that these energy companies then have a real chance as far as projects are concerned and are not just shoved aside by American companies .
That is why it falls to us to adopt the SAVE programme so that the liberalisation of the energy markets can go hand in hand with increased energy efficiency within the European Union .
This position is in stark contrast to the observation that , equally , government buildings could be described for the most part as archetypal wasters of energy .
Its aggressive expansion in neighbouring countries is doing nothing to further this aim .
Mr President , whilst we recognise the valuable aspects of the agreement as regards trade , development and cooperation between the European Community and the Republic of South Africa , it has raised some critical questions in our minds , as it has in that of Mrs Kinnock , relating to suggestions to be addressed to the Commission and the Council .
Thirdly , we strongly recommend that the agreement between the European Union and South Africa should not be to the detriment of Pretoria ' s excellent regional trade relations .
Mr President , first of all , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report that begins by saying that after five years of discussion , hesitation , prevarication , consultation and negotiation , at last , we have a trade agreement between the European Union and South Africa .
It is a modern agreement which is adapted to the times and is all about the liberalisation of tariffs , the setting up of a free trade area , agreements on economic and development cooperation and agreements on science and technology and on a political dialogue .
So in the long run , quality , along with price is at least as important as the name .
South Africa needs new impetus to promote economic growth and drive out poverty at a more rapid pace .
Whilst South Africans voted overwhelmingly for Nelson Mandela , Europeans voted in no small numbers for JÃ¶rg Haider and friends .
For although South Africa may belong to the African continent in geographical terms , we all know that in economic terms it is the front runner of this continent .
