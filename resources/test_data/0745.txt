in decision-making relating to the EU’s expenditure : in the redistribution of cash within the framework dictated by the Council .
Postponing resolution of the problems until the mid-term review at the end of 2009 will not increase Parliament’s power in EU budgetary matters .
On the expenditure side , the fact that the Council kept to a 1 % level for payment appropriations undermined a budget which could have achieved European added value , as the Community budget would have been more than just the sum of the Member States’ contributions .
We have not achieved the sort of flexibility in the financial framework that would have been necessary for good financial management .
He was working under difficult circumstances , but nevertheless enjoyed Parliament’s undivided confidence throughout .
In my opinion every one of us should bear responsibility for financing the EU.
Initially the emphasis in the financial frameworks was on improved competitiveness .
The funds intended for these were to be trebled within seven years .
It is good in the final outcome that progress has been made with the Structural Funds .
Now we need to hurry to make use of the time available to establish the financial programmes , otherwise unpaid commitments will reach intolerable levels in the first few years .     Mr President , I too want personally to thank the rapporteur , Mr Böge , for his excellent work .
The first of these is the Flexibility Instrument .
This is an important tool , because responding in humanitarian situations is precisely what the public expects of the EU.
I must express my disappointment with the Council’s original agreement and , in particular , with Christmas bonuses .
It is nevertheless important that consensus has been reached and that we can show our citizens that in the new EU of 25 countries decisions can be made even in difficult circumstances .
The importance of human rights has not waned as the years have gone by ; on the contrary , it has grown .
The EU can have a huge influence on human rights if it speaks with one voice .
The EU has not always managed to do that , although of course it has sometimes .
Hunger and real poverty are among the worst violations of human rights right now in the world .
Only in this way will NGOs representing different political groups and their views come to the fore .     .
A major reorganisation in the financing of external relations is to be introduced through the regulations now being discussed .
Cross-border cooperation is to feature a new arrangement , which will permit the flexible combination of the financing of external relations via the Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument , on the one hand , with funding for the territory of the Member States out of the European Regional Development Fund , on the other .
Hitherto , cross-border cooperation has been very unwieldy , as the decision-making systems for funding under TACIS in external relations and regional development financing within the Union have been very different .
The pending implementing regulation must be drafted carefully and take Parliament’s views on the matter into account .
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe is pleased that the other institutions have at last approved Parliament’s call for establishing an instrument for human rights and democracy .
The changes to the financing mechanisms are so significant that problems can be expected in their practical application .
I am especially glad that the Northern Dimension and cooperation with our northern neighbours were also covered by the regulation .     Madam President , the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument is actually very welcome .
The European Parliament has been calling for cooperation between the EU and its neighbours to be made easier for a long time now .
Although we are now introducing the one-stop shop principle we have wanted for so long into neighbourhood and partnership policy , it will be challenging to put the programme into effect .
Mr President , I wish to thank both the Council and the Commissioner for allowing Parliament to continue to participate in these matters in the future .
Firstly , it is a precedent , as for the first time it will extend legislation on the single market for the electricity and gas sector to nine countries outside the Union .
Establishing the Energy Community is in many ways a rational and justifiable project .
The energy sector in the Balkan region is undeveloped and continues to suffer the consequences of a war that took place a decade ago .
Furthermore , the environment is suffering on account of old power stations and their emissions and , in addition , the lack of investment and lack of competition both pose serious problems .
The fact is that a viable and reliable energy system will also tempt investors , which will result in the region’s economic situation developing , improved general stability and a reduction in emigration .
There are also causes for concern .
The parties to the Treaty should therefore ensure that public service obligations are fulfilled and that prices are reasonable , so that the poor too can afford electricity and gas .
Parliament insists that the parties should sign a legally binding protocol .
The single market must apply standards , in the areas of working conditions and social equality , for example , especially as we are talking about an energy sector that will be making massive profits .     .
My group wishes to stress in particular the importance of unhindered traffic in the workings of the internal market , and for that reason it has tabled two amendments .
These are , in particular , the Seventh Framework Programme , which concerns research and development , and the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme for small and medium-sized enterprises .
