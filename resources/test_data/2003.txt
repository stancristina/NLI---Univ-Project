of certain Member States - more concerned to protect narrow farming interests than to develop a broad-based vision of international economic and hence political relations - are preventing the launch of initiatives which could have extremely important repercussions , primarily for Latin America but also for Europe .
I am thinking here of the Internet initiative launched by Mr Bangemann , which we shall be discussing at the next part-session .
Time is pressing , but very briefly , what two points must be taken into account in this move towards a global regulatory framework ?
This amendment removed part of the appropriations entered in the reserve .
Mr President , with regard to paragraph 39 , on which we are about to vote , I would ask that , in the report which the Commission is to forward to the budgetary authority , it should also give the appropriate information on the situation of the other institutions in the context of interinstitutional cooperation .
The new text of paragraph 8 would read as follows : 'recalls that it has requested the Council to support unreservedly the principle of a statute for Members of the European Parliament , as provided for by the Treaty of Amsterdam ; draws attention to its resolution on the outcome of the European Council meeting in Cardiff of 15/16 June 1998 , in particular paragraph 20 thereof' .
So we in the European Parliament were keen to make our own contribution to this range of analyses , and above all proposals , geared to putting some order into measures in favour of mountain regions .
As I indicated earlier , the European Union has already adopted a strategy for lessfavoured areas , which include not only mountain regions but also Arctic areas and coastal areas threatened by desertification .
The rural population should be encouraged to stay on the land by granting them fixed - not unpredictable - additional income for ecological and social services over and above what must remain their main activity , namely farming .
The regulations on the CAP accompanying measures date back to 1992 ; now , in 1998 and six years on , this is our first across-the-board assessment of these measures .
In certain circumstances , the compensation paid will probably be too limited to meet the need , which is why we should perhaps consider cofinancing these measures at differential rates .
Indeed , I always fear that we expect rather too much of the Community .
I now have to put to the House some amendments from a single group , the EDN Group , the same amendments on which we had reached agreement in the text of the report , and which seek to generalise the issue once again , thereby taking us a step backwards .
Mr Fabre-Aubrespy was right : we were simply voting on the addition of four words , the usual four , in all the amendments .
Libraries merit special attention within the European Union 's cultural strategy , with particular reference to the information society .
One of its aims would be to cooperate on a technical level and to conduct targeted research into the manufacturing of permanent paper which does not deteriorate with age , so as to safeguard for the future our present library stocks , so rich in books and archives .
Homeopathic product sales are rising , and now account on average for 1 % of sales of medicinal products , with much higher percentages in some countries .
So it seems only right and proper that we should look at this issue again on the basis of the report the Commission has presented to Parliament on the application of the 1992 Directives .
Should it be left to the instructions for use to remind users to consult a doctor while using the product ?
Mr President , I have to admit that I have found it very difficult to take a firm position in an argument which is still very obscure and difficult to assess .
Obviously we are not scientific researchers in a position to clarify these concepts , so we need , and we should be able to expect , clear answers from research .
Tinctures in particular must be subject to rigorous scientific tests to establish what degrees of dilution guarantee the safety of the food chain and protection from contaminated preparations .
The approaches proposed in the directive to deal with these points are still valid , since they take proper account of all the interests at stake , striking a rational balance between the different views of the parties concerned .
To make this framework programme on culture for 2000-2004 effective , she has proposed a sectoral approach which takes account of the different needs of each cultural sector .
Movable heritage involves a wide range of skills , not always specialised , for restoration activities .
On reducing the indirect labour costs arising from national law , the Commission has pointed out that SMEs are hit hardest by relatively high tax burdens and contributions .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I congratulated Mrs Pack in this Chamber last year and I renew those congratulations .
The Youth programme combining Youth for Europe and the European Voluntary Service can play a decisive role in resolving issues linked to individualism , nationalism , insecurity and distrust of one 's fellow man .
So Parliament is placing major emphasis on the need to simplify the management of the programmes and cut down on bureaucracy so that access to them is guaranteed to all - to young people , to associations and to training and education institutions .
They include student mobility , lecturer mobility , mixed systems and training experiences , and then there is integrated skills training , in other words training which is more work-linked and more adapted to helping young people into work
