That is to say , what we want is the following : we are in favour of maintaining subsidiarity in the sense that Member States that wish to must be able to take a decision to ban the production of chocolate with other fats in their territory .
We naturally still defend and support this view .
But that does not mean that we do not want to give the consumer any information .
We want to exercise them , we agree to the five per cent but we also want proper safeguards for Africa and for the consumer and in this way we will have the courage of our convictions and bring our voting behaviour into line consistently , consistently for a year and a half , with the principles .
The small local chocolate makers on the other hand are restricted as to where they can operate and are therefore at a disadvantage .
Moving on to labelling , in a free market it is not up to the legislator to decide what ingredients the manufacturer is to use .
In this connection I would like to draw attention to the 1989 directive on official control of foodstuffs , which lays down uniform rules on the subject .
In any event we still consider it important and we have therefore tabled an amendment which again offers that choice , because that is the best choice .
The outcome in the Committee on Environment is now that information should be given in small print on the back , preferably actually in the name itself , and if that is unacceptable , we have to consider where would be most appropriate .
But there is no point in having more time unless it can be coupled with information for the consumer , so that the consumer can distinguish properly and the best way of doing that is by adding the information to the name .
Makers of pure chocolate which contains no other fats are at a competitive disadvantage and the consumer can be deceived by a product name which fits in with his experience .
That makes a mockery of it for most of the people who eat chocolate in Europe .
I would like to mention several points which might not have been brought up yet .
This is an omission for which the Commission deserves to be criticized , as it has admitted in its answer to a question I put on the subject .
I would like to put two questions : to the Commission , can you say whether it is consistent with our international trade commitments to give different treatment to cocoa exporting countries and countries that export oils and fats ?
I should like to know whether , if Members want to have their own computers installed in their own offices , it is possible for the computer provided by Parliament to be put in the assistants ' room and what arrangements do I need to make ?
That is also true of the two parliamentary committees , the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
When the budget was examined this year the main focus was on the financing of additional revenue .
However the burden of this very specific expenditure , which in my opinion cannot be compared with the rest of the EU 's expenditure , is still shared in the same way and it is extremely doubtful whether this situation is tenable in the long term .
Other countries must be persuaded to follow the same line .
The treatment of Mrs Bonino , who has given so much help to Afghan refugees , should certainly reinforce the Union 's protest .
They are really nothing more than a bunch of ruffians who use this as a means of increasing their power .
In fact the misery and famine were not caused by the devastating floods but mainly by the years of Stalinist government .
For me the most important lesson today is the shamefaced but real solidarity that Mr Ford and the Group of the Party of European Socialists have with the monstrous communist regime in North Korea , a regime that they are not prepared to condemn but at most mildly criticize .
Today we should have talked about the other Congo , Congo Brazzaville .
But another result of the discord was that China was able to punish a number of Member States with impunity .
Hopefully it will then become clear that the Council has also learned its lesson .
Both human rights policy and an unequivocal relationship with China are more important for the Union than dancing to the tune of China 's rulers .
The Albanians first want their conditions met .
Mr President , eight years ago , on 25 May 1989 , the European Parliament drew attention in a resolution to the case of Souha Bechara .
Mr President , the Indonesian Government 's policy of opening up remote forest areas for economic development has serious shortcomings .
Mr President , the resolution in front of us naturally reflects concern for the environment in Indonesia and the region , but in my view the resolution focuses almost exclusively on the environment and completely ignores the needs of many small farmers in the area who have to find land to make a livelihood .
We must see what specific help can be counted on for the restoration of the basilica in Assisi and the Giotto and Cimabue frescoes .
After the latest merger with Wolters-Kluwer the shareholders of Elsevier Read were rejoicing over a concentration of power in the field of scientific publications .
I hope that will happen .
I welcome the contribution Mr Perry has just made .
The journalist is paid twice and his or her article can be read by a wider public .
