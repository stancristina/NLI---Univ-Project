money - does not understand the need for us to proceed further .
We saw it in Finland the other day .
As you see , it is insisting that we talk with it at a time when it does not accept the 25th Member State of the European Union , Cyprus .
There have been about 500 000 deaths in Iraq .
Europe is on the American car carrier which drives us wherever it wants .
Do we know ?
A Sino-Russian axis is developing .
Let us draw up our own policy .
We cannot see it anywhere .
( Applause ) The Coalition and the European left as a body voted against the amended Bolkenstein proposal adopted by the European Parliament because it will bring the position of workers under pressure and is a serious blow to social Europe .
The Court of Justice of the European Communities systematically protects the undertakings that provide services in its case law , using the principle of the country of origin .
Mr President , Madam President-in-Office of the Council , Madam Vice-President of the European Commission , the experience acquired over recent years from dealing with natural and man-made disasters has revealed that there are shortcomings in the capacity for national intervention and , consequently , increased expectations of Community assistance , assistance which will need to have the attributes of effective intervention in the field of prevention and rapid response .
It goes without saying that , without the necessary funding and the fundamental participation of the Member States , the entire endeavour will remain in abeyance .
Mr President , the fact that this is the third time in recent months that we have discussed this issue demonstrates the enhanced sensitivity of the European Parliament .
The image of the European Union would be much more positive if there were a European mechanism and if the European Union were present after any natural disaster at the problem faced at that moment by the citizens .
Of course the Member States will also continue to be present , but what we want is for there to be coordination .
I know that you do not merely represent your country here ; you represent 25 countries and you must coordinate between yourselves , really coordinate .
We cannot proceed in this fashion .
It is incontestable that a democratic society must be represented in a worthy manner by both men and women and that equal participation should start with training and early initiation into the secrets of politics for men and women , without gender discrimination , and with the possibility of linking professional employment in international foreign politics with family life .
The constitutions and laws of the Member States should support the principle of equal treatment and the parties should promote worthy men and women without discrimination .
I do , of course , congratulate the European Commission on its efforts and the European Parliament should support the principle of equality and promote commensurate numbers during the composition of its directorates , delegations representations and delegations .
I acted as rapporteur for the annual report on the activities of the European Ombudsman in 2004 and I wish to point out that , compared with that year , during which complaints rose by 53 % over the previous year , in 2005 the Ombudsman received a total of 3 920 complaints , in other words an increase in the order of 5 % .
This does not mean that there are more cases of maladministration on the part of the institutions of the European Union , but that the citizens are more informed as to their rights .
The Ombudsman 's annual report illustrates , among other things , the efforts being made by the Ombudsman and the Commission , of course , to broaden and further strengthen the network of national and regional ombudsmen , by developing exchanges of information for best practices .
Mr President , to date the information leaflets and electronic media of the European Union have formulated its anti-grassroots policies in the most attractive terms in that , even though they are for the benefit of capital , they present them as being for the benefit of the workers , thereby eliminating opinions to the contrary ; nonetheless there have been no results .
It would appear that grassroots dissatisfaction is turning into a fight against this inhumane policy of poverty , injustice and war .
The White Paper basically develops a dynamic and active communication policy hypocritically on the pretext of freedom of expression and understanding of its policies which are applied .
The movement of refugees from Famagusta consists of displaced citizens from what has been a ghost town for 32 years .
Famagusta was a popular tourist destination .
Finally , what is needed is for the town to develop its own momentum , a momentum which will function as an example and precursor .
Mr President , the question of the return of the sealed-off area of Famagusta to its lawful inhabitants has never formed part of the overall settlement of the Cyprus question , on which the relevant United Nations resolutions have been passed .
Circles in the European Union are likewise wrong to accept this link .
Likewise , all the lawful inhabitants will move back to their town while , at the same time , the Turkish ports and airports will open to Cypriot ships and aeroplanes .
Mr President , as draftsman of the opinion on the accession of Romania on behalf of the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality , I should like to express our satisfaction , because Romania is developing - metamorphosing we might say - and progress is manifest everywhere , not only in the economic sector and job creation , but also in sectors which are crucial to democracy and the quality of life in the European Union
