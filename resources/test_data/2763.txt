£250 for a similar journey .
So to conclude , action in this area is overdue and if we do not do something about it very swiftly then our efforts to try to reduce the impacts of climate change are going to be stymied .
Mr President , I wish to address my concerns this afternoon to the proposed taxation on aircraft fuel .
Whilst there is recognition in this report that a kerosene tax cannot be imposed internationally due to the exemption in the Chicago Convention , nevertheless the introduction of such a tax , intra-EU or bilaterally , would be severely damaging to the United Kingdom and the entire European aviation industry .
Not only would our air fares increase dramatically - possibly by £80 per ticket , thereby threatening the very existence of the smaller carriers - but the damage would also affect the aerospace manufacturers , tourism , businesses and , of course , the freight carriers - they now carry a third of freight world-wide by air .
It is not true to say that aviation does not bear its costs .
In fact , the industry pays 100 % of its infrastructure costs through air traffic control and airport charges , amounting to US $ 4bn in 1998 - unlike other modes of transport , such as rail and road , which are still heavily subsidised .
These facts must be recognised .
In addition , to impose this tax would bring little benefit to the environment , as was proven by the introduction of the air passenger duty tax in the United Kingdom .
Aviation is in fact responsible for 2.5 % of CO2 emissions world wide .
Other approaches , such as trading and offsets , could be more environmentally-friendly and cost- effective .
Finally , such measures would ruin the competitiveness of the European industry vis-à-vis the rest of the world and would also cause massive job losses .
So I , for one , will continue to speak up for an industry which is often singled out as the big bad wolf .
This report is badly crafted on the part of the Commission and this Parliament .
The public at large deserves better .
Mr President , I find the idea of a unilateral setting of EU aircraft fuel tax regimes entirely inappropriate , given that globally we are still subject to the Chicago Convention of 1944 , exempting kerosene from taxation internationally .
European aircraft carriers would be disadvantaged compared to carriers from third countries and it would distort intra-EU as opposed to intercontinental fare structures .
While the expansion of air traffic and the environmental problems of global warming and pollution are serious and important issues , I feel that a more effective approach would be to tackle this within an international framework .
By focusing our attention too narrowly on only the activities which take place within the EU , we risk harming our industry without achieving much-needed progress in lowering emissions .
This same problem of trying to impose a regional solution to a global question arises with the difficult issue of VAT on digital electronic services .
To levy VAT on third-country suppliers , largely American , is not only impractical but , in the case of newspapers and books , it gives rise to inconsistencies between the same products sold on line as opposed to in a shop .
It is also inherently neither enforceable nor collectable , unless regulated internationally , as undoubtedly servers would be set up offshore beyond the EU 's jurisdiction .
The scheme will be harmful to the development of SMEs , both within and outside the Union , especially in view of the proposed reduction of the exemption threshold to a prohibitively low level of EUR 40 000 annual turnover .
I personally advocate a VAT zero rating of all digital services until international agreement is finally reached .
Finally , the Torres Marques report on a minimum standard rate for VAT represents tax harmonisation by the back door and threatens the UK 's zero rates on children 's clothes , food and newspapers .
As a British Conservative , I can only regret the high indirect tax rates throughout the European Union and I hope that by promoting tax competition we may bring pressure on our Labour Government to lower them in the United Kingdom .
Mr President , I thank the Commissioner for her continuing commitment in the field of maritime safety .
I should like her to answer two points .
Firstly , how will she persuade the Council to adopt her proposal on black-box voyage-data recorders ?
We are trying to do that now on the Erika I package .
We obviously would welcome her support on that issue , but we want to know how she will persuade these Member States to do what up until now they appear to be unwilling to do .
Secondly , there is nothing in her package to tackle the problem of the blacklisted flag states , states sadly that include Cyprus and Malta , where 50 , 60 , 70 , 80 % of ships have defects .
What measures does she propose to tackle these blacklisted rogue flag states that continue to flout international maritime law ?
I welcome what the Commissioner said about raising this matter with the Palestinian authorities , but I want to take him back to the last part of his original answer which was the dialogue between the youth of Israel and young Palestinians .
Will he reinforce the Community 's efforts in this field ?
That is where the future lies : to build understanding and tolerance between these two peoples .
That starts with the young people .
We spend some money on this but , when you consider the scale of the problem , it is still a relatively small amount of money
