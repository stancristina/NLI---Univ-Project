in its agreements with the ACP partners , makes strict demands regarding democracy and human rights , can and must condemn such a course of events .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the coup in Fiji in May of this year was not the first one .
If we are not careful , this will be the first major conflict in the Pacific and this may well affect the situation in the region for a few decades to come .
Could we not appoint a genuine mediator or mediating body in consultation with the UN and the Commonwealth ?
The original Fijian population has never had a say in the matter but has meanwhile been faced with the reality that the composition of the population has changed beyond recognition .
In South Africa , this situation even led to an atrocious system of inequality and oppression , referred to as apartheid .
Very often , people these days would prefer to see the descendants of these newcomers leave their country or else wish that they had completely adapted .
Madam President , in a moment , we will be listening to a communication from the Commission on the fuel crisis , and I am pleased that the Commissioner is able to attend .
In opting for a constituency week at this stage , you ought to have made it coincide with carnival week instead of the week prior to it .
I wonder why the European experts and powers that be did not meet sooner to establish , when prices first started to rise , how things would develop , how this could be prevented from continuing and how we could avoid getting to the point where we are today .
We need to ensure that the next crisis is not as deep and can be held off for longer than we might anticipate .
However , all credit to Mr Skinner for finally managing to complete it .
Needless to say , they should be securely fixed but it is not always possible to brace them against movement , as long as they do not slip .
Instead , we should be having a searching debate on a global strategy for our cooperation with the Southern countries , which involves the triptych of complementarity , coordination and cohesion , also known as the three Cs , where Europe continues to fail so miserably .
We need to abolish poverty in the world .
If this fails , then opponents of the joint development policy are bound to press for abolition full stop .
The EU aid policy is determined by the fifteen Member States and financed by contributions from the Member States , as established in the EU Treaty .
In our opinion , this means that the Commission should provide the added value over and above what the Member States can offer , such as granting emergency aid in emergency situations such as natural disasters and wars .
In the case of shortages of raw materials on the internal European market , the food industry can import these from the world market without any import duty and under inward processing arrangements , as has been the case to date .
It is inevitable that some industries will lose their export subsidies in the process .
It is also providing us with the opportunity to examine the situation we currently find ourselves in , as we are being forced to adapt regulations on two counts , which means that we sometimes need to adopt working methods which are not our own .
Because the European Union has , for a number of years , awarded refunds to Member States because it simply was unable spend it all itself .
In this sense , an interim regulation is essential .
The terminology , as it is currently before us , is clear .
I therefore hope that this report , as approved in the committee , will be adopted in its unamended form in the plenary tomorrow .
A remarkable state of affairs , given the sobering fact that hardly any foreigners live in East Germany .
This attitude is , to this day , leaving its mark in the east of the united Germany .
Mr President , the Liberal Group believes - with all due respect to yourself , Minister - that the Council of Ministers is looking foolish once again .
The Liberal Group believes that , in addition to all kinds of practical measures which are included in the document , it is , in particular , high time that criminal prosecution was improved by means of European cooperation .
Mr President , I would ask you to turn your attention briefly to a letter which we received from Mr Balfe , on behalf of the College of Quaestors , in which , referring to the car-free day tomorrow in Brussels , he has requested the Brussels authorities make an exception for the area around the European Parliament .
The police had picked them up in Calais , taken them from Calais to the Belgian border and had no qualms about subsequently dropping them off in Belgium .
Madam President , the big problem is always that if you receive one proposal after the other , not everyone is aware of the other proposals .
In addition , Member States must ensure that paid pension contributions are exempt from tax so that a new source of private capital can be tapped .
The second point is cultural cooperation .
In any event , Burma cannot be considered for this enlargement scheme .
Ten years ago , a military regime pushed the elected President , Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi , out of office , dissolved parliament , drove out , imprisoned and even killed numerous members of parliament , and subsequently applied extreme terror in its treatment of the population and minorities .
