What we want to see is conditions put in place for complete , effective implementation of the Structural Funds .
The taxation of undertakings was one of the areas covered by the so-called Monti Package of tax harmonisation measures .
We have always objected to this path , because it is an attack on the Member States’ tax sovereignty , and because it fails to solve the key problem of work bearing the brunt of the tax burden .
The negotiations were difficult and the compromise that was reached is far from perfect , yet we did what we had to in order to reach a compromise at first reading .
We need a clause ensuring that within three years we assess the system that we are currently adopting , and in this regard I welcome the calls for transparency and for the Commission ’s eventual assessment to be made public .
Ladies and gentlemen , one does not remove barriers by creating other barriers .
To conclude , I welcome this report and congratulate Mr Evans and those who helped him to reach the excellent compromise .     . – We welcome the compromise that has been reached and trust that it will not be amended ; in other words , the arrangements regarding state aid that apply to the regions affected by the statistical effect will continue to apply to convergence objective regions , as is being proposed for the outermost regions .
Under no circumstances , therefore , must these areas fall within the scope of the implementation of rules on state aid .
We believe that the state aid awarded to companies should be subject to a long-term commitment in terms of the duration of the investment , the number of jobs created and guarantees on workers ’ rights .
The principle whereby active public policy is justified when it is intended to boost social cohesion is thus enshrined .
The problem centres on the fact that regions and sectors built , economically speaking , on manufacturing , run the risk of being wiped off the map .
I shall go on to look into what can be concluded from this debate , and then address the UK Presidency directly .
This concern comes in the face of a lack of ambition which is , to all intents and purposes , hindering the necessary modernisation of our economies .     – The run-up to this Council shows just how serious our problems are in the EU , and is indicative of the crisis arising from the increasingly neoliberal policies , which pander to the interests of the large economic and financial groups in the most powerful countries .
It is not the only ‘item on the agenda’ , however : the liberalisation of services and the so-called ‘fight against terrorism ’ also feature .
It should be noted that a similar proposal was previously rejected by Parliament and did not receive the unanimous decision in the Council that it would have needed in order to be adopted .
A flexibility clause has been brought in , which will give the green light to the almost indiscriminate gathering of electronic information .
There is a concern , which came to light in the debate and in the adopted document , which I feel should be highlighted .
I therefore commend Mr  Frattini on taking such a clear stand .
I must congratulate the United Kingdom on the law lords ’ recent decision that information obtained under torture cannot be used as evidence in court .
The financial resources for this important common fisheries policy instrument must be increased , in light of the enlargement of the EU and the more ambitious objectives that have been set out .
As far as we are concerned , the primary objective should be to promote sustainable modernisation and development in the sector .
Although I welcome the Commission ’s efforts to make the financial agreements under the common fisheries policy ( CFP ) clearer and more coherent , I must express my displeasure at the mismatch between the professed objectives and the funds set aside .
It is therefore vital to ensure not only that funding is available to cover the start-up costs of the RACs , but also that the councils remain viable .
Furthermore there is no Community assistance for controlling and monitoring the CFP.
The reason why the VMS is functioning so incredibly badly is because of a number of derogations from key areas , and because the high-seas control system is so inactive and ineffective .
In other words , it advocates the same approach as before , whereby everyone in Europe can enjoy maritime resources , whereas the responsibility for protecting those resources falls entirely on the people who live in the regions in question .
Otherwise there can only be one outcome – Europe’s natural maritime heritage will fall into rapid decay .     . – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , fisheries control is an important factor in sustaining the sector .
Commissioner , despite your remarks , I feel that the amendments made to the original text are indeed appropriate ; they would help strike a better balance and make the text more consistent with what it is actually trying to achieve .
Otherwise , I shall have a great deal of difficulty in working with the Commission in future .     .
It does not matter how much Parliament glosses over its complicity in the systematic reduction in the Community budget in recent years – surely this reflects the commitments made by the right-wing and social-democrat forces in the Commission , the Council and in every EU Member State – but the ( cold ) figures are there for all to see .
A further reason to be pleased was the increased budget for initiatives in the area of research and support for SMEs , which are crucial if we are
