be perceived by our partners and by the outside world as speaking with one voice and conveying the values of the European Union .
At the heart of all that we do is the worldwide abolition of the death penalty and of torture , along with the protection of human rights activists and of children caught up in armed conflict , and I would like to mention the fact that Austrian foreign policy over recent years , not least under the aegis of Mrs Ferrero-Waldner – who is now a Commissioner – focused particularly on these issues .
The European Parliament’s achievements should and will receive due recognition in the forthcoming annual report , which will be prepared under the Finnish Presidency .
Mr Coveney said that the Council and Parliament should not duplicate each other’s work .
Mrs Lynne and others talked about the question of human rights in the European Union .
On behalf of the Council , I would like to express gratitude for this cooperation , which was tough but constructive .
The present constitution specifies what is to be done in the areas of disarmament , improved crisis prevention instruments , crisis management , mediation and measures to take account of the position of women and children in crisis situations .
We do not want a financial black hole here .
That much is essential , and it is something on which both the Commission and the Council agree completely .
In order to give you a better picture of what that means , let me say that , in the aftermath of the tsunami , we had a very cooperative dialogue in which we gave consideration to how the instruments that were now all working at once could be brought together , and how aid from the European Union could be got more quickly to the people who needed it .
Simplification and efficiency are not the same things as the voiding of Parliament’s right of codecision , the systematic blurring of the lines between development cooperation and foreign economic policy in our dealings with industrialised countries , or an obscure legal basis for the use of funds earmarked for development policy .
What I would like to say is that it is not the number of regulations that determines Parliament’s prerogatives , but rather their content .
First , we need to draw up a specific overview of the projects in progress , and then keep this overview up to date and ensure that the resources and projects are coordinated .
It goes without saying in this regard that , as is stated in the relevant decisions , the EU 's assimilation capacity must be taken into account .
In the case of Croatia , the situation is slightly different : much has been achieved , much progress made , but it seems to have been put on the shelf .     .
Concern for the fates of individuals is , in fact , and quite naturally , particularly close to the hearts of the European Union and the Council .
I shall be happy to deal with this issue in somewhat more detail although , if I have been correctly informed , I shall be able to adopt a more thorough position on it at 9 p.m. today , the Council having said that it is prepared still to be in this House at that time and to take part in this debate .
The gradual construction of a legal framework for energy , be it through the promotion of renewable energy sources or through the successive liberalisation packages , which by the summer of next year will guarantee a complete opening-up of the common energy market , is already contributing to a coordinated and common energy policy , rightly called for by Mrs Andrikiene .
We know , however , that powers in this area are very fragmented .
This is an important discussion , and I recently travelled to some of the new Member States to discuss issues such as this , for example turnover-tax fraud , which is a major problem throughout Europe and is estimated to cost the economy EUR 70 billion .
It is not possible to give a date for its completion .     This issue of course demonstrates that unanimity is a stumbling block not only on taxation in general , but also within taxation issues .
In addition , the Commission has presented the Council with a proposal to amend the Interest and Royalties Directive , which is currently still under discussion in the Council .     . – We are concerned here with the issue of fair tax competition .
Sixty-six tax measures in the old Member States and thirty in the new Member States have been classified as harmful by the Code of Conduct Group and largely phased out .
The latter comprise the following legal acts : decisions in accordance with Article 104(6 ) EC on the existence of excessive deficit in Italy , Portugal and the United Kingdom ; recommendations on measures to correct these deficits under Article 104(7 ) EC ; a decision establishing , in accordance with Article 104(8 ) EC , that the action taken by Hungary in response to the Council recommendations regarding the correction of its excessive deficit had proved to be inadequate ; and also a Council Decision giving notice to Germany , in accordance with Article 104(9 ) EC , to take measures for the deficit reduction judged necessary in order to remedy the situation of excessive deficit .
I have named all the countries concerned – Italy ’s deficit being a prime example .
The Council would like to emphasise that this means , of course , that Parliament is directly involved from the outset in the preparation of Community rules and the adoption of these rules by both of our institutions under the codecision procedure .
