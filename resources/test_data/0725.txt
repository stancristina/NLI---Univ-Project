As regards the matters set out in the preamble to the question concerning the status of the Western Sahara under international law , the Council would remind the honourable Member that this is a matter for the United Nations Organisation as the international organisation involved in investigating and settling the conflict in the Western Sahara , in keeping with the international rules that derive from the Law of the Sea .
The Member States are called on to comply with this directive by 5 October 2005 .
If they are not applied , then there are international and European bodies for filing charges against the Member States .
This is one more reason for saying that the review now being carried out in the Convention , human rights and a whole series of similar matters must be finalised and studied at Union level .
The Council would also point out to the honourable Member that Mr Solana repeatedly reports to the European Parliament on recent developments in the region and will obviously continue to do so .
I am in a position to know in this respect that the High Representative , Mr Solana , and the Council wish to work to achieve this objective .
Consequently , research and development in the field of alternative energy sources is conducted and funded within the framework of the framework programme .
The current framework programme was introduced under Decision 1513/2002 for the sixth framework programme of the European Community for research , technological development and research activities , contributing to the creation of the European Research Area and to innovation for the period 2002-2006 .
I would also remind you that the sixth framework programme of the European Atomic Energy Community , again for 2002 to 2006 , has earmarked a budget of EUR 750 million for research into controlled thermonuclear fusion , which could contribute to long-term energy supplies and consequently to the requirements of sustainable development for reliable centralised basic load electricity production .
I would again point out that there is no new question here .
Taking account of the impact of the ageing of the population on the job markets and its possible impact on the development and sustainability of social protection systems , the Member States agreed in Stockholm to increase the employment rate of elderly workers by 50 % by 2010 .
The Council is waiting for the Commission to include this priority in the employment guidelines and the Commission expects to submit the employment guidelines in April 2003 .
We all know , I think , how complicated situations are in which you have to try and reduce protection in the agricultural sector without causing an exodus from farming , on the one hand , and decide how to manage the question of the retirement age on the other , because the population is ageing on our continent and this is undermining the foundations of the pension system .
The proposal made in this respect , as I understand it , takes this approach and I am certain that the Commission could assess it and evaluate it in its proposals for the employment guidelines .
The Council cannot comment on this specific proposal and programme because , as I said , it is being discussed within the two institutions .
Regardless of the circumstances , the United Nations Security Council , in application of the Ohrid framework agreement signed in August 2001 , approved Resolution 1371 on 26 September 2001 .
.
We would point out that proposals such as those contained in the report , setting upper limits for the permissible contamination of sowing seed , pave the way for the gradual and complete legalisation of GMOs , with unforeseeable consequences for agriculture , the balance of the ecosystem and consumers ' health .
If we accept an upper limit for contamination today , even a low limit , tomorrow we shall be forced to revise it upwards , leading us into a vicious circle of adjustments that will ultimately result in the full release of GMOs .
Now six years on , and still no progress has been made with these reforms ; on the contrary , poverty rules , especially among the natives , who make up the majority of the population .
The motion abides by the 'common position ' of the European Union , which makes cooperation with Cuba dependent on changes to the country 's political system .
Socialist Cuba is a thorn in their side .
Do you think that this time our voice will reach the ears of its rulers ?
Unfortunately , the Egyptian Government is refusing to move him to Greece .
Who does the European Union ultimately conclude agreements with , Commissioner ?
Mr President , in connection with the question submitted on postal services , I should like to say on behalf of the European People 's Party that we are opposed to the inclusion of this question on the agenda for the following reason : the arrangement which the Commission promised to put in place , by which I mean the division between reserve and non-reserve activities in the same legal entity , basically concerns one Member State and the two existing directives therefore contain an authorisation in relation to postal services .
We therefore consider the question to be superfluous .
Women are underrepresented and , as can be seen from the list you have distributed to us , there are two countries - Estonia and Slovenia - which have not included a single woman in their representations .
The decision by this multinational comes on top of similar decisions by other multinationals , which have closed down production units in Greece in order to locate to countries with much lower wage costs and conditions in general which allow for more intensive exploitation of the workers .
Not only does the European Union do nothing to prevent decisions and actions such
