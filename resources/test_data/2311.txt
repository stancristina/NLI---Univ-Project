That is why , I repeat , the euro vote today is a rare moment .
We should , in fact , have followed the path of the European Monetary System by introducing a common currency , which would not replace national currencies , and would which allow us - since such a choice would not have been irreversible - to take stock of the situation after several years before contemplating , if need be , and with the approval of our citizens , progress to a further stage .
Not only does the Stability Pact put our economies in a monetary straitjacket , but , even more seriously , it introduces a true economic constitution , depriving governments or parliaments of any macroeconomic arbitration and even going as far as sanctioning offending states .
The current framework for the changeover to the euro threatens to accelerate Europe 's liberal drift and its alignment with the American model .
The members of the ECB Executive Board , who are appointed for eight years and cannot be removed from office , will have unprecedented influence on exchange rate and interest rate policy and other economic policies directly affecting people , regions and nations .
What are they playing ?
The vote that this House has just expressed involves the future of our countries .
I have opposed the Maastricht Treaty , with the single currency as its centrepiece , because I thought that it could not respond to this idea of Europe .
They also maintain that it will contribute to the fight against unemployment , while Chancellor Kohl has clearly stated that " the euro will not create jobs ' .
Will there be a green euro ?
The Chicago futures market is still there and will continue to be there .
Besides these false arguments , I agree of course with all the speeches made by colleagues from my group and I am voting against the introduction of the euro .
Politicians ' satisfaction should be dependent on the satisfaction of the people .
It is easy to see , however , how those tensions could be at the root of a disintegration of European unity , which has barely been achieved , and a resurgence , particularly between France and Germany , of forgotten antagonisms .
Which nations ?
We have rejected the Ecofin Council 's recommendation so that the nations can continue to act for the common good , in the interests of the people they represent ; we have rejected it so as to preserve the unity and stability of Europe and to ensure the lasting future of Franco-German friendship .
It excludes from patentability the human body in all its stages of development , procedures which use germinal cells , embryos and clones created for the purpose of reproducing human beings .
Congratulations and thanks go to Mr Rothley , who led the debates with great skill .
Every democratic state must ensure that they do not prohibit , but rather lay down a framework for scientific activity to avoid any deviant behaviour .
Human beings will not draw benefits from biotechnology unless they have a say in the details of its development , in place of the multinationals which only see it as a new source of profit .
Secondly , we will cause yet further delay if we start a conciliation which we feel is pointless , for this text has already been pending for ten years .
He is today thus not speaking on behalf of the committee , which was unable to support him .
I would like to pay tribute in particular to the rapporteur , Christine Oddy , who has taken great pains to bring this to a conclusion in spite of all the odds .
These synthetic drugs , as Mr Pirker 's report reminds us , are in effect consumed , not by socially or emotionally disadvantaged young people whose motives you could understand , but by young people who are completely integrated into society , who consider it fashionable , the "in' thing , to take Ecstasy , LSD or amphetamines at a rave or techno evening , and this with no danger to themselves whatsoever , or so those in favour of a "do as you please ' lifestyle confirm .
We already know this for a fact .
But we have known this for a long time , as we also know that driving after having taken alcohol or LSD is also extremely dangerous , for others as well as for yourself .
He also mentions the fact that some states have already established , aside from a system of legalization , controls on the quality of these forbidden products .
Apart from the fact that we know these drugs can have a harmful effect on health as well as self-control - heart problems , increased blood pressure , hallucinations , depression , aggression and so on -, it is also difficult to fight against these drugs because they are constantly changing and easily produced .
That is thus the case with this directive which , in order to do so , brings currently divergent national measures into line , through a ban on direct and indirect advertising of tobacco products in order to obtain a high level of consumer protection .
So , ladies and gentlemen , let us not stand guilty of this mass homicide in the face of history but let us adopt this common position as it stands in order to obtain commercial regulation of - and I will emphasize it once more - advertising , which needs to be uniform throughout the European Union , so that incitement to such self-destruction , such absurd self-mutilation , will finally come to an end .
With regard to health , Article 100a enables a high level of protection to be introduced ,
