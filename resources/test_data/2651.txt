recognises the basis on which a personal letter is written , that it is not for me to release a letter which I wrote to Mrs Gradin .
If Mrs Gradin wants to release it or gives me permission to release it , that is absolutely fine with me and , as I said , she has indicated by an indirect route that she would be agreeable to that .
I am not surprised at that - I know Anita Gradin very well - but until I have formal confirmation I cannot release the letter .
It is not in any way a secret .
I simply hope that Mr Gahrton 's powers of comprehension will advance greatly by the time that he reads the letter because he did not show much evidence in the course of his contribution of having any more than the most rudimentary understanding .
This question has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the question on the order paper .
I will , however , respond to it in the interests of transparency .
The person named by the honourable Member , who is a Commission official , has indicated total readiness to respond to all enquiries from the Swedish prosecutor .
That will take place in due course .
The Commission is very conscious of the need to increase the proportion of women in A1 and A2 grades .
It is for that reason that , since 1995 , annual targets are set for the appointment of women to these and to other management posts .
The Commission 's overall target , as announced at the beginning of our term of office in 1999 , is to double the number of women in these two grades during its term in office , thereby raising the number of women in A1 and A2 posts to 44 or about 20 % by 2005 .
To achieve this , the annual targets are set on the basis of anticipated turnover in the grades each year .
In 2000 the target for the appointment of women to A1 was two appointments and the target for A2 was five appointments .
These targets were exceeded with three new appointments being made to the A1 grade and seven new appointments to the A2 grade .
As a result , the current number of women at A1 level is four out of 54 and the number of women at A2 level is 21 out of 178 .
The Commission intends to continue its practice of setting annual targets because it has evidently assisted improvement in the gender balance , although patently not enough .
The Commission will adopt the annual target for 2001 next month .
In addition to the policy of target setting , the members of selection boards are reminded of the principles of equal opportunities to be taken into consideration in the selection of candidates .
The Commission seeks to appoint the most suitable candidate for a post and , where there are equal merits relating to the relevant post , to give priority to the female candidate .
The outcome must arise from objective assessment by the appropriate authority of each individual situation and is not therefore automatic for persons of either gender .
In the case referred to by the honourable Member , the advisory committee on appointments shortlisted a female candidate with good qualifications .
The Commission considered that the candidate chosen had a profile more particularly related to the tasks of the post in question .
As the honourable Member underlines , the system that we are seeking to develop in the European Commission does not yet bear any comparison with arrangements that have existed in Sweden , and indeed in some other Member States , for some years .
We can do nothing more in the circumstances than continue to strive to meet the best standards which we heartily recommend to others throughout the European Union .
These are standards which I , and my colleagues in the current Commission , sincerely want to meet .
If I could respond to the specific issues raised by the honourable Member : there is not enough representation of women at any level , including the managerial ranks , in any of the European Union institutions .
We are , as the honourable Member was good enough to acknowledge , making a serious effort to improve upon that in the European Commission .
But in the European Parliament , for instance , I think I am right in saying that out of the ten directors only one is a woman .
The position in the Council , if anything , is not even as good as that .
So in each of the institutions , including the others like the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors , there is patently need for very substantial improvement and I am very happy to have the opportunity at this Question Time in Parliament to underline that very forcibly yet again .
I believe we will reach the targets by 2005 .
They are not over-ambitious targets .
Indeed , several of us would argue in the current Commission that they are over-modest .
They are however realistic given our starting point .
What we hope will be the case is that by securing that at least 20 % of senior management jobs are in the hands of women by the end of this Commission , it will provide the incoming Commission with a much firmer and higher base from which to work towards genuine gender balance across the Commission , particularly in managerial roles .
I take the point that the honourable Member made about the single-sex nature of the selection board .
It is not in fact a selection board .
It is an advisory committee on appointments .
The final selection of candidates is made by the portfolio Commissioner , by myself as the Commissioner for Personnel Administration , and the President .
