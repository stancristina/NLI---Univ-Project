In addition to the capping of price reductions to 30 % in the common organisation of the market in sugar , I wish to highlight Amendment 3 , on support schemes for farmers , which refers to the possibility of Member States continuing to enjoy production-linked subsidies , at least to some extent .
Lastly , I should like to express my objection to the way in which the Council has approached this subject , from an institutional point of view .
No matter how much we reassess our reserves , and we negotiate long-term contracts , there will always be a threat to our energy supplies in Europe .
The Commission must be called upon to do more .
Statements made by the Presidency have fallen well short of addressing all of these issues .
Accordingly , we consider the word ‘rejects ’ to mean the same as ‘disagreement’ , which obviously does not undermine the agreement that was reached .     .
The agreement on the Community budget for 2007-2013 adopted at the December European Council is woefully inadequate in terms of financial resources and unsuitable in terms of the priorities and instruments required to address the economic , social and environmental needs and problems of a Union enlarged to 27 countries .
In this context , although the proposal before us rejects the Council’s agreement , it reaffirms Parliament’s negotiating position , itself inadequate in terms of funding and priorities .     .
The agreement reached in the Council is a positive one for Portugal .
The public are only too aware that the process leading to the adoption of the financial perspective in December was a complex one , which was indicative of just how difficult these negotiations can be , in particular in the circumstances in which they take place today .
The lack of ambition can be seen in the glaring signs of inconsistency with previously adopted policies .
Accordingly , we must not abandon our heritage and the broad international support we enjoy .
I therefore share the view of all those who , in Europe and the United States , have raised their voices against any abuse or violation of these values .
The EU must maintain a clear and consistent position in defence of democracy , the rule of law and human rights , in relation to what ought to be , in the broadest sense , the Middle East peace process .
This new legislation will strengthen the environmental rules in a number of Member States , and impose more stringent obligations on companies to tidy sites after completing their industrial activities , and in so doing honour their responsibility to protect the environment and public health .
I naturally support this proposal .
According to the rapporteur , these amendments will result in a reduction in health risk to bathers from 12 % to 7.5 % .
I welcome the proposed parameters for assessing bathing water quality , along with the methodology adopted for evaluating and classifying it .
I therefore feel that this proposal is a highly significant step towards protecting the people’s health and the environment .
It is now compulsory to indicate clearly how information can be obtained , such as information on the state of progress of proceedings for infringement of Community law and to make information available by assessing the outcome of various consultations .
Consequently , regardless of the intrinsic value of the issues addressed in this directive and the balance of social interests that was reached , I opted to abstain .     , .
This had also been an attempt to put this sector , which is so important to national development , in the hands of the major shipowners , thereby driving the two sides even further apart .
The purpose of this explanation of vote is to say that I share Parliament’s satisfaction , in broad terms , with the process of democratisation in recent years .
I share the concern expressed in this motion for a resolution , in common with others previously discussed here in Parliament , with specific regard to a number of principles with which I identify and which I advocate .
We are all opposed to all forms of discrimination and violence .
To classify differences as ‘phobias ’ is in itself an example of extremism .
We were especially disappointed at the rejection of the proposal to which we put our name calling for an urgent review of the relevant flexible mechanisms before the Community emission trading scheme can be extended to other areas , such as aviation .
The criticisms of the inadequacy of the proposals in the fight against poverty , social exclusion and increasing inequality were similarly rejected .     .
As part of the process , we must reiterate the need to ensure that sustainable development is a priority for the future of Europe , and retain our objective of meeting the aims of the Lisbon Strategy .
How can we govern such a huge and open cosmopolitan area ?
How can we find a way , together , of influencing the world ?
After all , our European identity was not born out of tradition , but out of morality , desire and reason .     – Mr President , I wish to congratulate Mr  Tannock on his report on the new European neighbourhood policy , which is set to be one of the EU’s most strategically important instruments , not least from the point of view of global security , as Mrs Ferrero-Waldner , to whom I also wish to pay tribute , pointed out .
Yet the south-western section of the security ring around Europe that this new policy seeks to build would be breached if Cape Verde were excluded from this instrument .
Accordingly , with my group ’s support , I
