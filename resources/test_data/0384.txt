Better to say too much about forestry than too little .
I note with interest his reference to telecommunications and the changes in the shape of the communication industry .
I happen to believe that despite all these wonderful aspects of modern technology , we will continue to need paper for our reading , because it is the medium that most people are still comfortable with and I certainly am .
Also , of course , we shall continue to need timber for all the other uses to which it is put , such as in construction and other possible new uses .
The rapporteur and the Committee on Agriculture draw attention to the potential for research into new uses of timber .
Can I sound one note of warning .
It is a little unrealistic to ask the Commission to ensure that paper prices in Europe are competitive .
I think that might be stretching the Commissioner 's powers a little bit .
I see he is smiling so perhaps he agrees with me .
Nevertheless , the Commission has to ensure that fair competition takes place .
That is the key issue here , rather than trying to favour our industry .
This is a valuable , sustainable industry , very important to the economy of Europe and to our environment , and this is a very timely report .
I would like to commend Ms Hedkvist-Petersen for her very thorough report on a subject that is of great concern to all of us .
The statistics are quite staggering : 42,000 deaths on the EU' s roads every year , an estimated 1.7 million people injured to one degree or another .
It is clear that this issue requires the concerted efforts of all concerned : EU , national and local authorities , as well as the many voluntary organisations and initiatives which aim to tackle the problem of traffic accidents .
The number of fatal accidents varies greatly from one Member State to another ranging from 60 to 243 per million with an EU average of 116 .
In my own country , Ireland , there are 129 persons per million inhabitants killed on the roads each year .
I find particularly disturbing the fact that road accidents are the most common cause of death amongst children and people under 45 years of age in the EU.
This is an intolerable situation .
The figures show clearly that the number of fatal accidents can be reduced drastically throughout the EU.
It is crucial that our commitment to saving lives on the roads , in particular those of our young people , is not just a lip-service .
There must be adequate resources injected into proactive policies at Union level so as to help individual Member States improve their traffic safety records .
At present the Commission ' s road safety budget is EUR 8 million per year .
I believe that the Commission needs to send out a strong signal of its determination to reduce road casualties .
I would call on the Commission to increase significantly the road safety budget and indeed to encourage Member States to follow suit .
Money spent on reducing road accidents is money well spent .
Inadequate road safety costs society and the Member States a great deal of money .
The human tragedy is immeasurable , but attempts have been made to quantify the damage , and these show that the enormous economic cost of traffic accidents in the form of medical and emergency treatment , damage to property and loss of income amounts to about EUR 100 billion per annum .
Things are certainly moving in the right direction .
During the 1990s , the number of road deaths in the EU fell by 26 % .
This trend must now be maintained and strengthened .
Parliament has consistently held that one of the major political goals of transport policy is to give priority to measures to improve safety for all modes of transport , as well as providing the necessary financial resources for this purpose .
The number of fatalities and injuries on Europe ' s roads is not something which is predetermined .
We must make improving road safety a political priority and provide the financial means to match .
I wholeheartedly support the report by my Socialist colleague which calls for new measures to tackle road deaths and promote road safety in Europe .
Shocking statistics show the severity of the problem .
It is simply unacceptable that as many as 42,000 people are killed and over 1.7 million injured on roads across the European Union every year .
Of course , the numbers vary from country to country .
In Portugal and Greece , there are as many as 243 and 212 deaths per million , whilst at the lowest end of the spectrum , there are 60 and 61 deaths per million in Sweden in the UK, respectively .
Every person killed is one too many .
Every case is an individual tragedy which tears apart a community .
We desperately need to improve road safety with safety equipment in cars , seat belt campaigns and better road signs .
The Labour Government in Britain is at the forefront , leading a campaign against drink-driving .
The lives of all our citizens , especially our young people , are too precious to take for granted .
Poli Bortone Report ( A5-0358/2000 )
Mr President , there are people here who are old enough not to have forgotten the extraordinary and harrowing reports that came out of Cambodia in 1975 , with aerial pictures of a deserted capital as the Khmer Rouge , their leaders schooled in the violent tenets of French revolutionary tradition and possessing a mixture of political idealism and mass psychopathology , moved two million people from the city to the countryside to begin a new society in year zero under the leadership of the
