want the proposal to be budget-neutral .
Allow me to state , moreover , that the EU is not introducing a tax policy by means of this proposal .
I would therefore also call on the Council to vote in favour of this proposal , even though I know that it is on a sticky wicket in , for example , my own country and the United Kingdom .
Finally , there is a fourth important consideration , namely that there should be a long transitional period .
This will also ensure renewal of the stock of cars on the road .
Finally , I just want to comment on the proposals from Mr Langen on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats .
I also of course agree that we must protect veteran cars , and I therefore have nothing against veteran cars being exempt from the proposal .
I do not myself own a veteran car , but I have every sympathy for owners of such vehicles .
I cannot recommend the amendments by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance , since they are not in keeping with the overall thrust of the report , apart from anything else because an earlier entry into force would be unrealistic .
Mr President , and not Madam President - I can see there has been a change of President - once again , excuse me for being so late .
That summit took place only a month after the accident involving the in November 2002 .
There is too little money , and it is not completely clear how comprehensive we shall have been able to make the system .
We would also particularly congratulate Mr Grandes on his report , and , as a Dane , I have to say how constructive it is that we have had the arrangements extended also to cover the North Sea area .
We assume that this proposal and the whole of this draft are of such a kind that improvements might also be made and that the level of ambition might also gradually be increased .
I do not believe that the proposal is good enough to enable us to prevent behaviour like that , but I hope that it is good enough to be improved and that it can therefore operate as a necessary framework .
Thank you for your proposal .
Naturally , we support it .     Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Gröner , for her outstanding report on the Daphne III programme .
Many women and their children have their lives ruined as a result of violence and , especially , threats of violence .
It is therefore of extraordinary significance that violence against women and children be made a distinct point on the EU agenda .
Parliament’s proposal focuses on the outrages that take place day in and day out in domestic settings and on changes that will force the national parliaments to take a stand on these serious issues .
The taboo and silence around violence must be fought , and the Member States ought to be making a massive effort to inform people – both the victims and perpetrators of violence – of how to get help .
Violence is not a private matter , irrespective of the area of life in which it occurs and of who perpetrates it and regardless of whether it takes place within a family or in public life or whether it be a case of violence by the state .
The principal objective of the EU’s activities to counter violence is to prevent and combat all forms of violence in order to completely eliminate this form of crime that is also a serious violation of human rights .
The fight against violence should be recognised as being part of the protection of our basic rights and freedoms .     I have voted in favour of the report in order to send out an important signal concerning the reorganisation of taxes for the benefit of the environment .
Taxes should continue to fall within the national competence , and it is fortunate that a decision concerning Mrs Riis-Jørgensen’s desire to limit tax revenues for welfare services cannot lawfully be taken at EU level .     Mr President , I am the longest-serving Member of the European Parliament and the one who has travelled most often to Strasbourg .
When we had to choose between Strasbourg and Brussels , I voted in favour Strasbourg , so I am not addressing you from an anti-French perspective .
That is a striking expression of grass-roots opinion .
We should therefore do what we can to respond to people’s criticism .
We could be given a report on the day’s decisions and take all the votes requiring absolute majorities .
The ball would be in the prime ministers ’ court , and they would be forced to establish a single place of work .
We can also send out a signal by not purchasing new buildings now .
I have tabled Amendment 9 in order to prevent or postpone their purchase .
No one has had the imagination to picture the city of Strasbourg taking financial advantage of the European Parliament and European taxpayers .
It must be possible to expect public authorities to be honest and to show loyalty to one another .
That being the case , the law must be changed so that public authorities have a duty of information when they deal with each other .
We have enough buildings , and now we must unite in demanding a single place of work .     Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as has been said several times this evening , education and training policy is to be decided on a national basis
