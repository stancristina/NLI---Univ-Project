such as these conventions which are so important for the construction of an area of freedom , security and justice , it is unacceptable for the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to be absent .
Madam President , you have said several times that this is a very serious problem .
Unfortunately , this is not the first time that Madam President has shown this inadmissible behaviour towards me .
These events have caused us great pain and shame and have awoken our fears given the extreme racism , xenophobia and intolerance demonstrated .
However , instead of producing these events which we are condemning , migration must generate social , cultural and economic enrichment .
Thirdly , the political parties must assume direct responsibility for the political actions of their public officials .
We thought we had eradicated the terror of intolerance which racism had unleashed in Europe .
I am also referring to the immigration policy of the regions , Member States and European Union which , due to actions or omissions , is leading to a few territories like Almería having to support this migratory pressure from north-west Africa on their own .
Mr President , Commissioner , I speak from experience acquired during many visits to El Ejido over the years .
We all agree in our condemnation of intolerance and we also agree that we must look forward .
The basic document is really no more than a Commission communication which embraces the conclusions and recommendations of a high level group on tourism and employment .
Yet there is a Council resolution from last June on tourism and employment .
I thank the President , Mrs Fontaine , who just yesterday expressed her opinion by refuting the implication of this House .
In the event that liberalisation is brought about throughout the European Union , what consequences would that have for free competition ?
I would therefore advise Commissioner Monti to deal with the issue of postal liberalisation , taking strict account of free competition , because I believe that this will probably become a very worrying issue in the future .
It has assassinated the spokesman of the Popular Party in the town council of San Sebastián , Gregorio Ordóñez .
All European democrats in this House must join together to send a message to the Basque Country that it is time to put an end to the division and killing .
Fourthly , we express our repulsion at the fact that this dual assassination was intended to directly destroy the political process aimed at achieving peace in the Basque Country .
We , Euskal Herritarrok , are convinced that a definitive solution to the present struggle can only be found through an open process of dialogue and negotiation with no limited agenda .
May I ask : Quousque tandem - Noiz arte ?
This is particularly true given that the Commission must soon prepare a report on the revision of the common fisheries policy in the year 2002 .
We must therefore act very carefully in this area and guarantee the confidentiality of this data .
This is why our committee asked to be consulted in advance and to be represented at the meetings as an observer in order to ensure greater and better control and to reinforce the European Parliament ' s role .
The revision of the common fisheries policy in 2002 is the biggest time-limited challenge facing us .
This must be our objective in Europe and throughout the world .
The oral question from our committee on the extremely serious consequences for fisheries of the accident involving the tanker Erika will also be considered tomorrow .
There are two political reasons why our committee and myself as its chairman must speak out about this issue .
Who better than the European Commission to make serious proposals for European harmonisation in these areas ?
How can those affected be compensated ?
I want to thank Commissioner Fischler for his answer to the oral question tabled by our committee .
These measures are very welcome and the Committee on Fisheries will monitor these very closely so that we do not have to spend more time in this House regretting such disasters .
Without risk of being partisan , I believe that the President-in-Office of the Council has presented a Social Democratic initiative consisting of modernising , rather than dismantling , the European economy , and that is what we are arguing for .
It is no less important to create , together with the monetary government which we already have , an economic government , that is to say , a strengthening of the Union ' s capacity for economic decision making .
( PT ) To conclude , I would like to say to Mr Guterres , as President-in-Office of the European Council , if you will forgive my poor Portuguese , that as he is the representative of a nation of explorers and sailors , I think we will be able to follow the route marked out by the Portuguese , a politically courageous people .
On the one hand we have economic efficiency , since , in this new technological context , the quality of human resources is essential .
We must learn quickly , create new practices more suited to the new society and invest in technological change , but we must never forget the people or the institutions .
It has to be done thinking of the men and women who live and work daily in our countries .
All of this will lead us to the need to define the role of Europe in the world economy , of Europe as a competitive platform - and I stress 'competitive ' - opening the way to new and better jobs , higher quality jobs from the point of view , of course , of guaranteeing social cohesion .
