The purpose is to end subsidies and restrict them by means of a certificate .
Already the market situation is putting immense pressure on the European producer .
Our committee and the European Liberal Democrats believe that the EU must safeguard the profitability of the production chain .
The Commission is proposing selective deterioration .
It may be necessary to act in this way , but certain principles have to be adhered to in this issue .
There should be some flexibility in setting the restrictions in respect of export aid procedures .
I would also like to make the comment that by replacing cuts in export aid with inward processing and additional procedures the effects will be unevenly spread , in that a heavy burden will fall on the remoter EU countries in terms of transport costs .
Our group supports the committee ' s amendments .
No barriers to the market should be set up , either legislative or technological .
Ladies and gentlemen , as nice as it would be for the employment situation for our legal profession , it would be an enormous burden for small - and medium-sized enterprises in Europe to take account of the legislation that exists in all EU countries and the signatories to the Locarno Agreement when they are engaged in e-commerce .
On the other hand , irresponsible rascals would remain in the market and they would look after the consumer only until the clink of money is heard in the seller ' s bank account , and no longer .
Besides , this would discriminate against consumers , as the consumer must have the right to order products from anywhere to go anywhere .
This kind of interpretation would probably also run counter to the principle of the free movement of goods and services as referred to in Article 49 of the Treaty of Rome .
It would therefore be impossible to require a company to find out beforehand about the consumer protection legislation that exists in the customer ' s country , as that country could be anywhere .
I would also ask the Council and the Commission to still take time to reflect whether it would be worth considering this charge-back mechanism , which Mrs de Palacio mentioned again in her amendment to the report .
It would also suit our group if Parliament were to make its own statement regarding this issue .
Everyone has certainly tried in all manner of ways to highlight the importance of this question ; nevertheless , I think his proposal is this time the most valuable and the most appropriate one in this situation .
Mr President , may I begin by thanking the rapporteur , Mr Skinner , for the excellent work he has done in drafting this report .
I would like to express this even more strongly than the Commission did .
Efficient venture capital markets are also a precondition for the development of entrepreneurship in Europe .
In fighting unemployment , concrete measures to alleviate the tax pressure on labour are also urgently needed .
I also want to emphasise the importance of reducing the costs and administrative procedures involved in setting up a company and getting back business after bankruptcy .
The present communication shows that even if some progress has been made Europe still has some major weaknesses , particularly when compared with its main competitors .
We should ask ourselves whether the deadline of 2003 is too late for Europe .
I therefore totally support Parliament 's view on point 23 , calling on the Commission to keep us regularly informed about recent developments .
Institutional investors such as insurance companies , investment funds and pension funds play an increasingly predominant role in providing risk capital .
Pension funds in particular have been gaining in importance in the last decade as the demographic changes increase the need for retirement products .
The developments over the last few days with the single currency have been unfortunate .
Now we only have to make sure that we make it fast enough to use the current window of opportunity .
The purpose of the trans-European networks is to link up different regions of the EU , so that the common market may function effectively .
The kind of freight also has a decisive impact on volume .
In the peripheral regions ports are particularly important , although the volume of freight and number of passengers are smaller than in central areas .
This would mean that the ports in the TENs would be concentrated on the densely populated central areas , and many sparsely populated peripheral regions would accordingly remain outside the TENs .
This service is not just important as a link between Scotland and Northern Ireland , but it is also important for the Irish Republic .
In this respect the Council ' s position would serve the development of trans-European networks more effectively .
European bus measurements may seem a trivial matter , but it is no such thing .
Our objective of a dynamic single market can only come about if all players comply with the same regulations .
There are no Greek bus companies in our country , Finland , but the Scots have already got a firm foothold .
Uniform measurements will also mean cost saving for manufacturers , which will be reflected in fares and the pockets of EU citizens .
The Commission is right in its proposal to allow 15-metre buses .
If we support group travel it will reduce congestion in built-up areas .
A few half-empty cars take up the space of one bus carrying sixty people .
People will not feel favourably disposed towards the EU if we start scrapping buses that are still in perfectly good condition , before their time .
Mr President , Mr Prodi , as has often been said in this House , the Charter of Fundamental Rights is
