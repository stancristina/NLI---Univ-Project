stood up for .
I would have liked more in the field of employment policy and also in many other areas , but here it was not the Commission , but the Council that was , regrettably , very cautious and hesitant , as President Prodi has already pointed out .
Mr Sharon , the Prime Minister , spoke about this on Monday in the Knesset , and I believe that we Europeans should also insist on that ; it is this position that unites the Council , the Commission and Parliament .
Those who understand only the language of violence – and they are present on both sides – need to be isolated .
It is evident that certain Palestinian elements are almost afraid of the prospect of an Israeli withdrawal , for , in that event , Palestinians in Gaza would at last have to get themselves organised and get stuck into rebuilding the city and its surroundings .
The same is true of elections , which are necessary , and I am absolutely in favour of them .
We have to ensure that the EU continues to stand for openness to the world , for liberality and tolerance .
The protection of our citizens demands that we take action against terrorism and organised crime , and , in the area of data protection related to this , it is important that we come up with a good compromise between counter-terrorism , our economic interests and the rights of citizens .
I think the conservatives had good reason to abstain , and that there are very , very good reasons for voting against .
I regret that I have seen no analysis of this whatever .
The ECB attaches the highest importance to regular dialogue with the European public and with its elected representatives .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Central Bank’s annual report for 2003 is in a new format , one that is clearer and easier to understand , with more details and greater transparency , including on the critical aspects of current policy .
We do not believe that it needs to be amended .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by warmly congratulating Mr Trichet on the way in which he has done a good job of continuing the work of his predecessor Mr Wim Duisenberg .
Such a volume would make for greater transparency and could also build up the public’s identification with the European Union .
Might it not have something to do with the lamentable fact that we in Europe , represented by spokesmen , some of whom we have already been able to hear here today , have got ourselves stuck in an ideological fight to the death about what the European Central Bank’s primary purpose is meant to be , rather than taking a more pragmatic approach ?
Here , I am referring in particular to the example of Greece , where we need Europe to exert tighter control , something that I hear said , alas , all too infrequently , even today .
At Adam Opel AG , there have been six chairmen of the board in five years , trends have been missed , and ranges that are insufficiently innovative or attractive have failed to attract customers , quality has been sacrificed for the sake of short-term cost reduction , thus gambling with the firm’s good reputation , and these things amount to serious errors on the part of the management .
If the Commission is elected – which , as things stand today , I do not think it will be – Mr Verheugen , as early as next week , will have to take on the task as part of the Lisbon strategy .
It is necessary to draw attention to these points , particularly now – and I very much agree with Mr Mann on this – that representatives of industry associations and the ideologues retained by them are hard at work dismantling the types of co-determination that we in Europe introduced as part of our social model , and pronouncing them unsuited to the modern world .
I believe that we can gain some optimism from what Mr Rehn and Mr Verheugen said in the hearings .
The committee will deal with these matters this evening , but in both cases and on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , I should like to recommend that at this stage the request for urgent procedure be rejected .     – Mr President , we are very much in favour of this and support the request for urgent procedure .
The strength of our European cultural identity lies in the fact that we accept cultural difference and tolerate it .
We should take note of that .
Even within our groups – as you of course know from bitter experience – there are very heterogeneous currents of opinion , and anyone who wants to win a large majority in this House has to show consideration for these different currents and try , as far as possible , to accommodate them all .
One final comment : a democratic vote is a normal democratic act .
You act as though you were responding with something new .
I would therefore ask you , Mr Barroso , to take this very seriously .
And , because this is what it is actually all about , I should like , once more , to make our position clear .
What the public expects of us is that we approve members of the Commission only if they are beyond reproach .
This is the point that we should keep in mind .
In addition , it is our impression that the Environment DG has insufficient staff to implement the policies that we want .
