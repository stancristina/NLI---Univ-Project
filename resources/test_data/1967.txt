To find this additional allocation , we are asking both for something to be taken from the biological sciences and for the total budget to be increased slightly .
The development of the European markets , the competitiveness of companies and the citizens ' energy purchasing power are dependent on the achievement of the energy objectives .
Again within the scope of international cooperation , the energy dumping and environmental risks will have to be taken into account for the countries in which the prices are still lower owing to far less restrictive environmental regulations than the Community regulations .
Firstly , I would like to point out that the Commission has actually brought a considerable number of infringement actions against the Member States .
No-one has yet managed to tell them .
However , I would like to make three comments .
The Council rejected the proposal .
The situation is not all white or all black , and the Commission cannot put pressure on science , I am sure you understand .
Mr Martinez , if firing a Commission could have resolved the BSE problem it would have been very easy , you know , because a new Commission could simply have been brought in to replace the old one .
I understand the frustration of the producers , indeed I share their concerns , but frankly I was not the person who invented BSE !
I wonder what the final solution will be .
It is the integration process that has enabled us to reach levels of wellbeing never before reached for such a large number of citizens .
It is the integration process that has enabled countries , torn by three wars in the space of a few decades , to build a peaceful and prosperous Community together .
However , if the new era means a Europe expanded to 21 and then to 27 , the change will certainly refer to the geographical aspects , not to the quality of the Union or to its depth .
We are pleased that the political wish of our Parliament not to exclude any applicant country has been accepted and we are also encouraged by the establishment of the European Conference and a negotiation procedure for accession which lays down a strategy reinforced by pre-accession , with partnerships and assistance during the preaccession period , providing a differentiated approach without excluding any applicant country .
The fact is , Madam President , that some countries have already far exceeded these situations with very risky budgetary policies , which will create a particularly serious situation for monetary union .
According to our group , however , there is an urgent need for changes in the common agricultural policy , and the 1996 Court of Auditors report sets out several problems including that of cohesion .
The growers fear that this option rewards land income , they fear a decline for all growers , capable or otherwise , they fear effects on employment ; so this is what we have to discuss , and in our amendments we have tried to answer these fears ; for example , by linking the new unconnected aid with the utilization of olive production , combining it with the historic profits for uniform regions and providing the possibility for the producing states to modulate aid according to quality parameters and respect for the environment and landscape , for the disadvantaged regions .
Only with a reformed aid system will olive growing be directed towards the often declaimed policy of quality utilized on the market and in an ever more attentive and demanding consumer .
We therefore call upon common sense .
This has been appreciated by our group and we intend to defend it , tomorrow , when the time comes to vote .
Finally , we are also in favour of an increase in the European guaranteed maximum quantity , in a fair definition of national quotas and in a strict regulation of product labelling , permitting the utilization of quality and the identification of the place of origin of the oil .
I think that the document drawn up by the Committee on Agriculture is a good document , indicating a path to be followed by the leading associations , by growers , by national political forces and also by the members of the left democratic party .
Finally , we need to guarantee a stability of the oil price as soon as possible , by specific means such as the establishment of a private stock of product , assigned to the producers ' organizations , and improving all promotional activities .
Smokers would continue to smoke by buying cigarettes from third countries and thus worsening an irreversible crisis of agricultural production in the poorest suburbs of southern Europe , that is , in Greece , Italy , Portugal , Spain and so on , where tobacco is often the only crop possible .
Mr Rosado Fernandes has already apologized for his reaction , which is understandable in many ways .
If the colleague who offended him would do as much , I think the incident can be considered closed .
I also think that the debate should now move forward but I think there is still a huge difference between a political dispute , which can take on more indignant tones even in this Chamber - but we are MEPs , politicians and we know all that - and physical attack .
For these reasons , I think it right that the European Parliament , as proposed by the rapporteur , should reject the agreement and ask for the spirit of the regulation to be observed and the procedure of cooperation to be applied rather than that of simple consultation .
Mr Paasio , whom I wish to thank , has done a good job , by managing to get the entire Committee on Development to agree to his amendments which
