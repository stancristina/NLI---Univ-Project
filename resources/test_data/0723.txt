general criticism we expressed during the previous sitting of Parliament regarding the orientations of the European Commission ' s work .
For example , in the environmental field , we have a White Paper on civil liability in environmental matters .
Full employment does not mean the total absence of any form of unemployment .
Improved living conditions , employment and the quality of employment will continue to be intimately linked to our ability to make European research more dynamic .
You will be aware that , as a result of this crisis , which has now lasted for more than two years , many independent producers find that they have been relegated to being mere casual workers for firms or other large-scale producers .
To tell the truth , I feel that this is not an acceptable compromise and that the use of vegetable fats has been made an acceptable commonplace while not giving consumers sufficient information , ignoring the problem of the analysis method ' s lack of reliability , removing subsidiarity and complying with the requirements of multinational chocolate manufacturers , while ignoring the concerns of small specialist chocolate-makers and SMEs , consumer rights and the future of the millions of farmers involved in cocoa production .
What right , then , has the European Union , with regard to the food traditions of some Member States who incorrectly describe products including vegetable fats other than cocoa butter as 'chocolate ' , to enforce a change in the very definition of what chocolate is ?
The Council leapt into the breach , adopting its common position , which recognises the designation 'chocolate ' even for products with other vegetable fats added .
Some Member States have enjoyed a derogation from this law since acceding to the Union .
In order to appease the multinationals , consumers would have their lives made more complicated as labelling would become more creative and reassuring , small specialist chocolate makers would have to establish a 'quality chocolate ' label , cocoa-exporting countries would have to adapt... and you dare to speak to us of a Europe that is close to the citizens , that is generous , transparent and respectful of cultural differences !
What then ?
There is a clear lack of transparency , and yet we distinguish butter from margarine .
If not , when will we see wine made without grapes and butter without cream ?
No matter nowadays what the consumer wants , what the consumer ' s preferences are , no matter the fact that public opinion wants ever greater transparency !
Sixty-six months to carry out a study of the impact of this directive , such a time period is enough to cause irreparable damage to the export structures of these countries .
This responsibility is a historical one , primarily , and is related to the commitments made by Member States to the countries where the bulk of the tropical forest is located .
We can only applaud the proposed European directive which would make it possible to apply these principles .
The fact is , as the rapporteur points out , that regulations already exist , but they are not observed .
International regulations were already in existence , since the Marpol Convention imposes binding international regulations upon all vessels , according to which all discharges at sea are prohibited .
The proposed directive and the amendment proposing to establish a standard charging scheme for vessels in ports , in all European ports , in order to finance the processing of shipboard waste , tackle the problem on two fronts : they force the ports to set up the facilities and the organisation to handle the shipboard operational waste , either under direct state control or by subcontracting to specialised competent operators , and , more importantly , they deter vessels from evading their obligation to dispose of waste since they will have to pay the price in any case .
It is indeed essential to improve the level of safety and to mitigate the environmental impact of these vehicles , the volume of which is constantly increasing .
This necessitates clear and concise drafting within a single , comprehensible text .
To this end , I should like to stress two points .
Last month , the European Parliament in fact adopted an amendment asking for a Committee on Information Technology and European Liberties to be set up .
Next , the charter would provide a new pretext for the frenzied standardisation of citizens ' rights in Europe .
The fact is , you refute the transcendental and the sublime because you confuse moralism with morality - indeed , Goethe , as you know , said that moralism was the opposite of morality - and legalism with law .
Is it to be citizenship in the way that we traditionally understand it , with rights which characterise in a specific way the people belonging to a given community ?
There needs to be a list of rights which will be directly upheld by the courts , but there also needs to be another list of general rights which the Community institutions and others will have to take into account when drafting policies ; some in the Court , some simply as background forming a valuable basis when we are taking other decisions .
We had , however , identified , for institutional reasons , with regard to extremely serious or sensitive issues , five categories of exceptions requiring unanimity .
The matter we wish to deal with is how to maintain what already exists and share it with all the new Member States .
That is the second principle .
Finally , with regard to the minimum requirements for social security , there is one possibility that we propose to extend to social security , which already exists for other areas of social policy , which involves adopting minimum requirements by qualified majority vote
