We believe that the European Union should abandon costly fisheries agreements of this type and switch over to providing support above all to the developing countries &#x02BC ; own fisheries activities .
Such a solution would make a better contribution to the task of developing the importance of fisheries for worldwide food supplies , boost these nations &#x02BC ; economic development and also remove the risks that may be involved in the fisheries agreements , e.g . that certain Member States&#x02BC ; fisheries activities might receive indirect support to continue operating in a situation where the entire European fishing industry is in need of substantial restrictions .
Novo report ( A4-0363/97 ) We did not support the report .
We would therefore like to see the situation developing in such a way that the Community neither enters into new agreements of this type nor extends previous agreements .
The original challenge was twofold : first , through close cooperation , to subdue an historic hostility which tears our continent apart in order instead to build up friendship and understanding , and secondly to provide political and economic strength and thus the confidence in our system based on democracy and market economics , which was necessary to be able to resist the external threat which the Soviet Empire posed on the dark horizon .
Its successes make the Union an example in the new historic era .
The peaceful revolution in the east has its roots in the peace which it was the European Union 's original task to create .
The conditions for this future task are improving to the extent that countries in central and eastern Europe are gaining membership and can thereby be given a role within the Union .
Important economic adjustments have laid the basis for market economics .
However , the tragic experiences in the former Yugoslavia teach us how easily nationalist politicians have been able to exploit latent conflicts in the turbulence following the fall of the Soviet Empire .
It is difficult to carry out reforms - you have to be able to see the goal .
Only through this clear instruction can the European Parliament give directions on how to set the enlargement process in motion .
The European Union was founded on the idea that integration brings gains , not burdens .
These gains are particularly evident in the Baltic area , which at the beginning of this century had Europe 's fastest economic growth .
All European democracies who share the Union 's values and objectives , and who wish and are able to accept the Union 's laws , have the right to become members .
For the Nordic and Baltic countries it is very gratifying that Estonia is in the first negotiating group .
Membership of the EU for some of the Baltic states will also be a the final proof that the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact has finally been dumped on the rubbish tip of history .
This is an historic event which fills us all with gratitude and humility .
Even Carl Bildt has criticized the EU in his new book because of divisive tactics in the former Yugoslavia .
The Commission 's proposal divides not least the Baltic states .
Another key question is whether the new Member States will have a say in the EU 's future or not .
New walls are now being built between the Czech Republic and Slovakia , something which the EU could aggravate if Slovakia is completely isolated .
Finally , a Fortress Europe must be avoided , that is , border contacts with Russia and Ukraine should not be made more difficult for countries which are close to these two countries .
Many people want to have more members , but still the same EU.
Those who do not submit to the prevailing EU ideology are described as anti-Europeans .
There is no analysis of the effects on the current Member States .
People ought to see that the only sensible option is an intergovernmental organization which concentrates on some of the major pan-European problems and they should instead carry out a corresponding transfer and decentralization of a lot of other matters to national responsibility .
Parliament 's work has been both extensive and intensive .
It has to be clear to all the applicant countries and their populations that they are part of an enlargement process and that they will become members when they fulfil the criteria for membership .
There is a political will to enlarge the EU.
We would send the wrong signals by only selecting certain states .
Therefore a common start to negotiations should be made with all at the same time .
Madam President , this report is both unrealistic and illogical .
This continuously reinforces the differences between the countries ' economies .
This is the only realistic starting point , as is also expressed in Amendments Nos 1 , 2 and 3 of the report .
This then requires us to have more flexible workers .
Instead they must go hand in hand with social security , a guarantee of employees ' rights and the aim of creating more jobs .
As far as our Amendment No 6 is concerned , the Green Paper also says that influence and participation are important matters for a new organization of work .
I think we should do that if we want a development with participation and transparency .
Mr Andersson 's well-written report concludes that Europe is lagging behind competitors like the USA and Japan .
In my opinion attempts at EU level or at national level to intervene in the organization of companies or in another way to limit their freedom of action will be counterproductive , that is , they will not help to create new jobs and increase employment .
We also have to think of new forms of work .
It is absurd to have , as we do in Europe , the
