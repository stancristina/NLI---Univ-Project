doubt in several other countries too , according to the latest media reports .
Secondly , comparative advertising is an opportunity to provide the consumer with better information and thirdly , it promotes competition .
Nevertheless , comparative advertising must of course still fulfil certain conditions .
Another point is that by allowing comparative advertising , the opportunities of the smaller companies to challenge the market leaders become much greater .
As I have just said , the amendment for which we finally received support in the Council with regard to imitation goods , is very important .
That was not the Parliament 's fault and I would request the Council and the Commission to stick more to the rules .
In fact , as Parliament , we should never have been able to approve this programme and we should not have been able to approve the result of the conciliation proceedings .
I thought it had been agreed in Amsterdam that job creation was the number one priority .
At first reading , my group , not just me , Mr Simpson , voted against .
Where quality fails , it is not because of geographical differences , but because of a lack of efficiency .
Unfortunately , the Council also extended the possibilities escaping the obligations involved in the universal provision of services .
I should also like to congratulate the rapporteur , Brian Simpson , on the common position of the Council .
I know of few cases where the Council has so greatly departed from a Commission proposal in order extensively to meet the views of the rapporteur and the majority of the Parliament .
I should very much like a pledge from the Commissioner that at the end of next year he will come up with a realistic programme for the real liberalization of the market in the interests of the consumer and jobs .
Much has changed for the better since that time .
Fifteen years ago the figure was only 20 % in the Netherlands .
So the advances are very small and that does not apply only to the Dutch government , it actually applies to all governments .
Because , in my view , equality between men and women in this world makes for a better world .
There was a meeting in the Netherlands where the question of why women do not rise from middle to top management , and one senior manager of a large multinational in the Netherlands asked another : " Do you like seeing women in your top management ? '
I should just like to examine the amendments .
With regard to the amendment to point 20 of the resolution , we would recommend just voting against the last part .
Agenda 2000 says nothing about mainstreaming in central and eastern Europe .
There will , nevertheless , in the very near future , be a number of extremely important challenges in which the concept of mainstreaming will have to demonstrate its usefulness .
As someone just said , Mr Commissioner , we therefore expect you to develop benchmarking for women and an equal opportunities test .
Training for police officers and judges is often lacking .
Because there are often no refuges and no helplines because they are too expensive .
Just think of the enforced sterilizations that have been so much in the news in the last few weeks .
It is freezing in this Chamber and I hope this is not part of some strategy to keep the women super-cool during this debate on women , and stop them getting too heated .
For liberals , the boundary between press freedom , and freedom of speech , and discrimination is violation of human dignity and the unnecessary exploitation of the human body .
Then we shall not need any extra legislation .
I must honestly say that I do not think censorship of advertising would be appropriate .
We also knew at that time that certain statements before this panel could turn out badly for us .
Before 1991 there was no common market in bananas .
And that principle has now been abandoned , by the Commission as well .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this debate concerns an extremely interesting subject .
I wish to bring forward a few points in this debate that I personally feel are of great importance .
I also want to ask again for attention be paid to the European company statute .
But I have not completely understood from the Commission what specific action and sanctions they now wish to impose on the dealers in these illegal substances .
Mr President , I have two questions for Commissioner Brittan .
It will provide for a ban on investments in illegally expropriated property .
It is important that the parliamentary delegation also discusses these problems with their colleagues in the Algerian Parliament .
Mr President , the Middle East is an area where colonial powers have created the background to the present situation by means of divide and rule tactics , for their own advantage .
Islamic leaders in the mosques of Egypt , Syria , Lebanon and Iran continue to praise the Palestinian suicide squads literally as religious martyrs .
But at the same time Mrs Albright has talked over the heads of the Palestinians and Israelis and over the borders of Israel to the surrounding areas .
Everyone knows that .
A new breakthrough in the deadlock is needed now .
Furthermore , the Group of the European People 's Party is pleased that by means of this directive the European citizen will be guaranteed an extended range of essential telecom services at his disposal .
We are therefore supporting a number of amendments in that area .
Through the advent of the Internet , for example , and especially through Intranets , enormous cost-savings are anticipated in the field of sending documents by post for companies
