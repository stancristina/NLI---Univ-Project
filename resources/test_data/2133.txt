The second aspect to consider is that of the long-term effects , which will be key in the future , since the affected areas are poor regions in the interior of the country where forestry was the main source of employment .
Mr President , it is a crying shame , to my mind , that we are not legislating on climate change today , because , given the remarkable profession of faith I have witnessed here , I do not believe we would have as much trouble passing legislation as we have had in recent months .
The 1990s was the hottest decade for two hundred years .
I would also , however , like to express my sympathy with all those of my fellow-countrymen whose lives were affected by the fires and who are going through a time of anxiety about the future .
Furthermore , that tone managed to ease our burden .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as part of this joint debate on economic and social cohesion , we are analysing the Mastorakis report on the Commission 's second progress report on European cohesion policy .
In order to realise the full potential of its cohesion policy , thus reducing inequality in regional development , the European Union must maintain its support of current Member States at a constant level .
Finally , I have nothing but praise for the creation of a new Objective 2 , on the basis of regional competitiveness in accordance with the guidelines laid down at the Lisbon Summit .
Back then , at the time of each of those challenges , the resources dedicated to the economic and social cohesion policy were doubled .
Mr President , the draft resolution we are about to approve by codecision takes account of a profound change in the VAT system for travel agents .
( PT ) I decided to support this report , which aims to replace several previous directives on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens or mutagens at work .
This proposal clearly moves in that direction .
This will prevent any consequent adoption of legislative provisions through implementing measures other than the codecision procedure .
( PT ) Over the last few years , every aspect of the travel industry has undergone profound changes .
It also strikes a blow against tax evasion on the part of European companies falsely claiming to be based outside the EU and not charging VAT to consumers .
The labour force sample survey proposed in this report will allow us to take ever-more effective steps to create jobs .
All of these will improve the availability of comparable statistics on employment and unemployment trends and describe the structure of labour-market participation by individuals and households .
Greater transparency in the exercise of the Commission 's implementing powers , as well as proper Parliamentary control , will undoubtedly allow Community intervention measures to be adopted more effectively and appropriately .
In this context , the ne bis in idem principle is undoubtedly one of the urgent prerequisites in order for mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters and a strengthening of legal security to take place within the Union .

This situation may put a stop to the granting of bank loans , especially to small and medium-sized enterprises .
As the Structural Funds are one of the principal tools for achieving that aim , they should be retained at their current levels .
( PT ) I voted for this report , welcoming in particular the judicious inclusion of a set of 'warnings ' relating to current Union cohesion policy .
The proposal now under consideration stipulates , for example , that English should be used as the working language when a ship 's crew and the authorities on land have no other common language .
Madam President , in order to safeguard the freedom of movement of persons within the European Union , it is essential to safeguard their social security rights .
We must go further , though , without forgetting the regulation 's four principles , as the rapporteur points out .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Regulation 1408/71 has been around for more than three decades and was created in order to coordinate Member State legislation in the field of social security .
The intention is to modernise and simplify the regulation and , in this context , a significant step forwards has been taken in various areas , in particular with regard to the rights of the unemployed , pensioners and frontier workers and their families .
Moving from specific cases and solutions to common ownership of fishing resources under a supposed Community law is , however , no longer acceptable .
Mr President , I should like to open my speech by asking a question ; is there a common fisheries policy , apart from the one that is used to uphold the privileges enjoyed by some countries and fleets ?
I support the report precisely because it represents a step in the right direction , calling for the fishing countries , fleets and companies unfairly excluded both by the incorrect application of the principle of relative stability , and by the current protocol to be given the opportunity of fishing in Greenland 's waters .
Secondly , we are finally seeing budgetary transparency , something that was previously lacking , as pointed out recently by the Court of Auditors .
Mr President , I would also briefly like to welcome the Commissioners and raise an issue that will occupy centre-stage throughout the debate , particularly but not exclusively with regard to agriculture .
As you know , last year in Seville the European Council strongly affirmed the need to develop a strategy on the management of external borders .
The Commission did not take part in planning or managing the various off-shore
