European action would also be further enhanced by the setting up of joint embassies of the Union countries .
Mr President , ten years ago I worked in newspaper editing and no one then had ever heard of Nagorno-Karabakh , Ingushetia or Dagestan .
A very important part can be played here by the OSCE , for example .
Mr President , with the best will in the world I have to say it is intolerable that when we need to be here by 3 o'clock people have the nerve to block off all the lifts just because a delegation is about to arrive .
Let me put the following case to the Commissioner .
Self-criticism is a good thing in any movement and moral judgments which block the way to selfcriticism are thus ethically very dubious or at best worthless .
Those in charge must be able to devise reading materials and to exchange expertise and experience on the subject with colleagues elsewhere in the Union .
In this way , in cases where the Council may possibly find its hands tied by a veto - this by way of a challenge here - we shall look to the Commission even more to make full use of the powers and creativity it already has .
Against that background it is inappropriate and incomprehensible that the British Government should be putting up one obstacle after another to stop a European Observatory from getting off the ground .
European agreements were proposed which would make revisionism an offence .
In Germany it is already an offence to deny the reality of Auschwitz .
I wonder whether Major , in the context of his general election campaign , is not perhaps appealing to the basest instincts of the British people .
We are happy to agree with most of it .
Certainly , and the rapporteur , whom we compliment , has made the point , we must make sure that an industry which is already structurally weak is not burdened further .
Mr President , it is a good thing that we have the Green Paper and it is good that we have Mrs Schmidbauer 's report too , because there has been an awful lot of talk about internalizing external costs in the transport sector but very little to show for it .
Mr Kinnock is right to apply a zero tariff to inland waterway transport even without modern technology .
But my colleagues are all too ready to say in their own countries yes , of course we want that , but it has to be done internationally .
In a number of respects the Green Paper fails to convince me .
I am afraid that the railways will then be disadvantaged still further compared to the roads .
Article 177 , the obtaining of a preliminary ruling .
The draft agenda says that we are to vote on the motions relating to reports on which the debate has closed .
So my question to the Commission and Mrs Wulf-Mathies is this : can the EBRD invest in new nuclear plants in the Ukraine if this is not the cheapest solution to the energy problem in that country ?
Obviously the Eastern Europeans are keen to sell sizeable quantities of fossil fuels .
I fully appreciate that a multilateral treaty of this kind cannot impose too many dictates , but an awful lot is left to the goodwill of the Member States .
Lastly , Madam President , there must be greater concern under the cohesion policy for protection of the natural world .
In other words , it was geared to increasing growth , restructuring economies and narrowing the gap between levels of prosperity in the Community .
The principle of compensation should be a routine part of the planning procedure .
There are two more minor points on which I have tabled amendments .
What do we do about someone who is unemployed but undergoing training ?
This is a proposal which may be fine for the workers themselves , since they will not notice any difference , but it is an anomaly in the system , and I think that systems which constantly need exceptions are not acceptable .
I would therefore urge Mr Flynn to bear this in mind and to make sure , if we really are to coordinate social security and taxation for frontier workers , including in Regulation 1408/71 , that there is only one choice .
This is a point that I would ask you to put on the agenda for the Council , Mr Flynn .
It is therefore not surprising that there should be serious discussion in the Member States , and finally also in the Netherlands , about whether it makes sense to go through with EMU.
One of the most controversial issues in the debate on this report in the Committee on Social Affairs was the question of convergence .
Mr President , I too should like to thank Mr Melkert for coming here today , and I should like to take the opportunity to raise an issue of considerable concern to me : the democratic deficit in social security and employment .
On the subject of pensions , I do not think we need to worry about having capital cover schemes instead of redistributive schemes , and I would urge Mrs Weiler seriously to reconsider our amendments so that our group too can vote for this report , which contains a number of good ideas .
Of course , we need to recognize a number of facts that have affected most Member States in recent years .
In all the discussions on European monetary union , there is far too much talk about taxation and far too little about social issues .
However , there is much less consensus at European level about how the refinancing of the schemes is to be organized
