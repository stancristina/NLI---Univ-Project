Similarly I would emphasise , as the rapporteur does , that information and communications are a priority in the strategic fight against racism .
Anti-racist action must involve all players , in a spirit of very broad partnership .
As we are now revising these programmes it is important to give emphasis to the importance of interaction and tolerance when the programmes are being implemented .
Madam President , I too wish to congratulate Mr Evans for his excellent work , which I support fully .
From the year 2000 the Tempus III programme now proposed by the Commission will aim to provide support under the PHARE and TACIS programmes for those partnership countries that cannot participate in the other Community programmes .
The focus of this activity will be the administrative reorganisation of the universities and educational developments that will involve opening doors to the world of business and enterprise .
As funding under the PHARE and TACIS programmes is , however , limited , as has been said here , it is absolutely vital to ensure effective coordination with other Community action , so that the greatest possible benefit may be derived from the programmes .
With the new Tempus programme a clearer policy will emerge with regard to attempts to stabilise the recipient countries zone .
Through education the programme will thus be helping to promote reforms in the economy , democracy and government .
By giving more weight to European research we will be able to bring these countries closer to the Community and , furthermore , learn from the effects of integration .
Up to now Parliament has had its first debates on the new legal basis for the Socrates and Leonardo programmes as well as the youth programme and the framework programme for culture .
For that reason we must recognise its hard work , and I would like to thank Mr Evans for this report .
It is therefore only natural that the European Union should lay such great store by developing cooperation among universities .
It is especially important to make youth , and university students in particular , aware of the importance of international involvement .
Today 's university students are the founders of tomorrow 's society .
Though the priorities might be the furtherance of knowledge and skills , student exchanges open up a whole new approach to international issues and problems .
But we in the European Union in particular have to realise that we will by no means always be just the provider , we will also be the recipient .
Instead , I wish to raise a few points concerning the programme itself , a programme I wish every success in the future with the proper level of funding it truly deserves .
I believe it is most important to achieve a lasting , positive social effect even after the year of the Capital of Culture has ended , and that is why as many of the public as possible should be actively participating in the event , and be given the inspiration to do so .
The success of the Year of Culture will be mainly based on cities ' own resources as well as their own particular features , history , and the challenges of change .
Creating permanent cultural cooperation projects in this way is one of our central aims .
Unfortunately , the solution adopted from the year 2000 onwards has been to appoint all nine applicant cities as Capitals of Culture , and thus none will really stand out as 'the ' Capital of Culture .
Finland 's turn will come in 2011 .
Mr President , Parliament is being urged in four separate reports to approve the Europe agreements with the relevant countries , and this is clearly happening , thus creating a firm basis for the future enlargement of the Union .
Much work and time is required of these countries for economic and political harmonisation .
For this reason it seems very likely that in the medium term all the Baltic countries will be able to join the European Union simultaneously .
It is not enough to enact laws and sanction cooperation agreements .
These small but important issues have yet to be put right .
This will require big sacrifices and changes in their societies .
This year Latvia intends to restrict pigmeat imports from Estonia and Lithuania for a year .
I would therefore like to ask whether the Commission has arranged for other satellite channel companies to compete for the production of the television programme , and if not , why not ?
Then I would respectfully ask the Commissioner to provide me , if possible , with the memorandum that spells out the rules that relate to Euronews .
Madam President , Mr President-in-Office , Commissioner , the Luxembourg summit called for agricultural production to be able to continue in all regions of the Union , including wherever there were special problems .
In the south it is too hot and dry , while in the north it is the opposite : too little warmth , which reduces crop yield and raises building and heating costs .
Aid for the storage of maize should therefore extend to silage for those producers of milk and beef who cannot farm maize because of the prevailing natural conditions .
In northern regions crop farming needs increased subsidies owing to local conditions .
Grain too has to be dried .
In Finland , the Union 's northernmost Member State , food production is possible thanks to the Gulf Stream .
The crises of the global economy in Asia , Russia and South America have forced world market food prices down .
The changes in the global economy have to be taken seriously , and we should not be making it difficult for farmers to cope in the face of major challenges .
It is
