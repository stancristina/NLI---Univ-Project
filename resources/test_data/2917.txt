Apparently , it is only a technical matter , with perhaps some rather more exciting elements such as reduced rates for records and CD-ROMs.
Yet the single currency of the dollar does not stop New Jersey and the State of New York having different local tax rates .
I am also in favour of a broader scope for reduced rate VAT and , in this respect , I believe that the Castagn√®de report opens up several options and a certain number of amendments help to widen this scope .
I therefore call on the Commission to submit proposals on these matters .
Ladies and gentlemen , SMEs are difficult economic subjects for legislators to address in Europe due to their diversity and large numbers .
The European Union should now go beyond declarations of intent , develop the positive resolutions that it has adopted by subscribing to the platform of measures and the declaration of the 1995 Beijing Conference , and put them into practice , especially in its development aid policy .
Discrimination in the labour market remains very strong and little change has been registered in wage inequality .
A good many are endeavouring to do so but others are still at the stage of wishful thinking , although a few have made efforts in certain sectors .
In the 1950s , it was still common practice in my country to sack women when they married .
I should like to take this opportunity , Mr Flynn , to ask you to give us further information on this subject .
For these reasons and depending on the votes on the amendments , we shall take our final decision when the time comes .
At present , trade in these products , in the broad sense , is still prone to all sorts of fraud and smuggling , to such an extent that such practices have become 'institutionalised ' in certain countries .
The Commission must introduce new computerised controls on the intra-Community movement of goods subject to excise duties , linked to the computerised system for Community transit .
That said , you would have thought that Buenos Aires and Kyoto might have tackled the causes of the problem , such as by banning Pinatubo from emitting gases and banning human beings and the like from breathing so that we do not exhale CO2 .
There has been no significant reason up to now for instability to spread in Europe and any coordination , with a little discipline , among the central banks would equally have resulted in relative stability .
The text says nothing at all about the risks which this crisis might pose for certain industrial or banking sectors in Europe and therefore fails to consider the necessary support and adjustment measures which could be useful for protecting jobs in different sectors .
Then realistic choices must be made in terms of Russia 's institutional needs .
The speed with which Russia embraced the techniques of democracy proves that if we had provided this training early enough and on a large enough scale it would certainly have been successful and would have helped Russia become part of a rediscovered greater Europe .
My third reason was the situation with Cyprus since 1974 , and my fourth , which is by no means the least important in my opinion , is the fact that Turkey has still not acknowledged the Armenian genocide in 1915 , and even goes so far as to deny it ever happened .
Would it therefore not be more realistic and honest to put forward ways of cooperating which are consistent , strong , even close , but which do not form part of an accession process , a prospect that we are continually offering , but continually putting off ?
Although the Mobutu regime was clearly condemned and progressively isolated by the international community from 1982 onwards , the wealth of the country offset the economic isolation that should have resulted .
In this context , we hope that the European Union will call for an immediate ceasefire and support African initiatives , in particular those of Nelson Mandela , to try to prevent unrest in the region and find a negotiated settlement to the Congo crisis .
Is he ever likely to hold elections or do away with corruption ?
It is true that colonisation did have its darker side , but the fact remains that , even if we contest the borders which the colonial powers established , we still have to admit that they often brought an end to wars that pitted African nations one against the other .
Even though we want to secure peace as quickly as possible , we must remember that , in other regions at other times , the dialogue established to resolve such conflicts was long and drawn out .
At no time did I feel threatened .
To counter this we have an important lever in the form of European and international aid .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , in the context of the joint motion for a resolution supported by our group , the Group of the European Radical Alliance , we have tabled three amendments on the methods of combating these scourges , particularly through the establishment of a European fleet of water bombers .
Madam President , I would like to make a brief reference to Rule 19 of the Rules of Procedure , before we start debating the reports on the agenda .
We cannot , in fact , ask that everyone everywhere has the right to part-time work .
Mr President , I voted for both of these reports and I am happy that the House has adopted them with such a large majority .
Our first amendment states , on behalf of freedom of choice , that women must be able to choose between immediately finding a job or delaying entering the labour market in order
