internal market - of course not - but in order to make sure that we manage the changes these things bring , through a spirit of partnership in all of our workplaces , large and small , within the European Union .
That means that we need to pursue with vigour the general framework on information and consultation at work .
In the health and safety field as well , there is a need to update and modernise the legislation we adopted in the past : the pregnant women at work directive , five years overdue for review ; the noise directive of 1986 , ten years overdue for review ; a number of directives that need to be radically updated and modernised .
But is it just about updating ?
No.
We do not need any new great raft of social legislation , but there are areas that have not been addressed .
We have outstanding promises for legislation on homeworking , on teleworking ; we have the yawning gap of social security in atypical work that has been outstanding for almost a decade now ; we have the promise of a specific directive on muscular-skeletal injuries outstanding from the last medium-term Social Action Programme .
There are other areas .
I had a woman come to see me recently , called Mrs Angela Elliot Mathis , working for Lucent Technologies .
She was head-hunted into the company at a very high level to work as a senior manager and a board member .
She had worked in a range of European countries for high technology companies .
Thirteen months into the job she was dismissed without notice and without reason .
She still has no reason for the dismissal .
The remarkable thing is that she has no protection in either Belgian law - she was working in Belgium - or European law .
Without that sort of protection people will not take the opportunity to live , move and work wherever they can within the European Union .
These are the gaps we need to plug.
Let us do it in the new medium-term Social Action Programme .
Mr President , I want to highlight the areas of the work programme which affect directly the work of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism .
With regard to regional policy , my group would like to see the Commission ensure the full application of the partnership principle at all levels of programming of the Structural Funds .
We , along with other groups in this Parliament , are still waiting for the Commission to present a proposal laying down the practical arrangements for the implementation of the code of conduct that would facilitate cooperation and proper scrutiny .
When , Mr President , will the Commission go further on spatial planning and submit new proposals to develop the decision taken at the informal Council meetings , notably at Potsdam and Tampere ?
Regarding transport and tourism , I and my group welcome the proposals reinforcing transport safety although we need more concrete proposals on road safety and in particular , the issue of blood-alcohol levels and speed limits .
I also welcome the ongoing commitment to the Galileo project and the review of the TENs strategy , especially with its highlight on the railway sector , a sector which we believe to be very important indeed .
However , I have to say to you that my group deplores the fact that several dossiers at this moment are blocked in Council .
We also want progress on both the working time directive and the slot allocation at airport directive , as well as measures to end the misery in air traffic control delays in Europe at this moment .
We are also concerned , President Prodi , at the lack of proposals concerning the tourism sector , a sector in which so many of our citizens work .
I regret that transport issues do not appear to have been taken seriously into account in the enlargement chapter and would encourage the Commission to present proposals to ensure better coordination between structural actions and instruments and the PHARE and TACIS programmes .
I also want to insist that Parliament ' s views and wishes on postal services , often stated in this chamber , are taken fully into account in any new proposals .
Whilst I am grateful to Mr Prodi for outlining the Commission ' s work programme this morning , I have to say that in the areas of regional policy , transport and tourism , the programme is more notable for what is missing than for what is in it , and I would hope that over the next year we could put those matters right .
Can I take this opportunity to welcome the programme in the context of the five-year strategic plan .
I particularly wanted to congratulate President Prodi on emphasising the issue of governance in the overall planning process .
The Economist last week was rather scathing about the importance that was attached to this issue , but we have a huge challenge ahead in attacking the institutional architecture that we need to create for the 21st century - an architecture that has to be commensurate with our responsibilities and our position in the world .
The outbursts in Seattle and Davos for instance were not just about the issues - they were very much about a populace and a citizenry trying to engage with a new set of institutions and being not quite sure of how to do so .
Therefore , opening up the invisible cities of decision-making in Europe to the citizenry is absolutely vital .
Can I welcome the annual programme in particular because there was one omission from the five-year plan .
That was the whole area of education , youth and culture which did not make an appearance at all
