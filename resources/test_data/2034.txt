For that reason alone , the way this matter is dealt with must be significantly more discriminating .
What we need are clear decisions at European level with regard to the continuation of cohesion policy and regional policy beyond 2013 .
I do not think so .
The European Parliament has already condemned the laogai system several times in the past .
In China , for example , people can still be executed for what is purely a crime against property .
There are problems here that are beyond our control .
I would also like to mention liability for such major events .
I believe that this debate naturally opens the way for a different energy policy in the EU - and that also lies within your remit .
Firstly , we want to check the security precautions for future licences ; in other words , what higher or highest standards are possible for new authorisations .
Our starting point must always be to create the highest security standards for people and for the environment , so as to prevent such disasters from the outset .
BP will be prepared to apply the same standards to similar drilling and rigs off the coast of Libya as in the North Sea , even though , under Libyan law , this may not be necessary in order to obtain authorisation and may not be laid down in legislation .
We will come back to you on this and I am counting on your support .
However , we are sceptical as to whether the opening up of the public procurement directives and the creation of a concession directive will , in the end , really result in us putting the internal European market on the right track , since obviously , we are clearly against any inflation of the public sector .
This needs to be clearly laid down in primary law .
Countless people have used the more liberal visa conditions to travel into the European Union .
I am a little bit amazed by the nine EU Member States in the Basel Committee , as they have allowed the process to be deemed completed despite the fact that we fail to see how there is a level playing field between the economic structure of the United States and the European economic and banking structure , and between classical retail and investment banking .
This House is the legislative body - Commissioner , you know that , and we know that you do - and this legislative body will pay close attention to what is put on the table and , where it makes sense , to what is put on the table here , too .
This cannot be the last word , nor is it the final version that we will accept .
We need the definition of liquidity before we get the draft directive .
Commission fines in antitrust cases ( debate ) Madam President , Commissioner , first of all , I would like to thank the Commission for the flexibility it has just shown .
Ultimately , one thing that can and should bring about good cohesion policy , with its varied elements , is being the engine of growth in the European Union .
Of course , we need to review our priorities - clearly , we do need greater efficiency .
With that in mind , coordination is very important but the same rules are not .
That would result in a very different picture .
Financing for the European Social Fund should at least stay at its current level .
However , I would also like to call on you to make your voices heard at a national level , in order to enlist support for the causes you have spoken about today , so that regional policy remains at the heart of European policy in future .
For 40 years , the Day of the Republic was celebrated lavishly and even ostentatiously on 7 October .
John Paul II was the first conspicuous sign of the winds of change which would blow across Europe from then on and which , in 1989 , would become a storm of upheaval .
Now , people could rightly say that the Brandenburg Gate had become the gate of freedom .
Everything that followed was linked to this admission and was the consequence of it , so to speak .
I would also like to mention the name of Jacques Delors , who achieved a great deal as President of the European Commission and who provided us with indispensable help in the process of bringing about German unity .
Our people and our country were able to stop running round in circles over the German question .
In my opinion , the continent on which we live will have a positive future if it can find the centre point of these values of justice , democracy , peace and freedom and if it can find the unity which we lost after the Second World War .
These are the things which unite us .
Therefore , I am asking you for just one thing today and I am making an urgent call to the peoples of Europe : Let us search for , promote and defend the things which unite us in everything we do .
Last week , the Committee on International Trade voted unanimously in favour of postponing the granting of discharge for the 2008 budget of the European Police College ( CEPOL ) and against the closure of the accounts for the same .
It ought to be in the interests of Western governments to preserve this diversity and to take action to raise awareness of this matter because , in the long term , the preservation of biodiversity can only be beneficial from an economic point of view , too .
In this connection , the various 'cards
