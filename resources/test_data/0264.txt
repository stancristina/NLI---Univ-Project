The Council has delayed opening talks with Parliament on how to deal with classified documents within the area of freedom , security and justice .
As the rapporteur points out , however , there is a fundamental principle at stake here , namely that the Geneva Convention allows any applicant for asylum to have his or her case individually examined .
The rapporteur observes that this regulation would only apply to Switzerland , which is clearly insufficient justification for drawing up such a legal instrument .
This is rather ironic , given that France is about to fail , for the third year in a row , to comply with that very requirement .
In six of the 12 candidate countries , unemployment exceeds 10 % , leading to social exclusion and poverty .
Once again , the solution lies in a thorough revision of the EU 's entrenched neoliberal economic and monetary policies .
As we know , employment , employment policies and their coordination constitute one of the main challenges facing the EU today .
Both face inevitable decline .
This harmonisation finds its highest expression in a power which the Commission would like to claim for itself : 'shall closely monitor the degree of new gas supply import contracts from non-EU countries ' ( Article 6( 1 ) of the proposal ) .
Various researchers claim that there is a need to bring demand into line with supply capacity , to restrain demand according to the rate at which the resource is being exhausted , thereby avoiding any imbalance .
( PT ) I voted in favour of the proposal for an amendment whose approval by a majority meant that the European Commission 's proposal was rejected .
The best strategy might perhaps be to leave this matter as it stands today and concentrate above all on promoting real mechanisms for linking stocks together , for encouraging a community of interest and connections between European energy networks .
That is why Amendments Nos 1 and 2 in this report are dangerous .
( PT ) This initiative by the Federal Republic of Germany with a view to adopting a Directive on assistance in cases of transit for the purposes of removal by air - which is to say expulsion by air of people accused of being 'illegal immigrants ' - is one of a set of initiatives and measures whose aim is to build ' Fortress Europe ' .
.
That is exactly why it is justifiable to insert clauses forbidding transit when there is a risk of any third-country national suffering inhumane or humiliating treatment , torture or the death penalty , or when his or her life or freedom is threatened on grounds of race , religion , nationality , social group or political conviction .
These conditions are to be respected aboard ship ; delegating the authority to award qualifications to companies which have the technical expertise needed for the job , and which are independent of shipowners ; setting up a European Parliament committee of inquiry .
A Parliamentary delegation , of which I was a member , travelled to Galicia in March of this year and observed the scale of the disaster at first hand .
Let us hope that these measures will mean that my region or any other will experience them NEVER AGAIN.
Developments such as the adoption of Amendment No 23 , whose partisan language is unmistakeable , prove as much .
We cannot and must not underestimate the value of strengthening vessels ' hulls , monitoring their routes ( shipping lanes ) , a high degree of professionalism among their crews , moving shipping lanes further out to sea , and of using corridors correctly .
In its resolution of 4 September , the European Parliament insisted that the amount of appropriations for the European Union should , within the framework of the draft Forest Focus regulation , be the same as in the previous 1992 regulation on the protection of forests from fires with a view to funding appropriate forest fire prevention measures .
We have , therefore , tabled another amendment with a view to restoring the amount of aid to the EUR 25.5 million programmed in 2003 .
Mr President , Commissioner , allow me to begin by telling you in public what I have already taken the opportunity to tell you in private , namely that I profoundly admire the courageous and direct manner in which you are facing up to your responsibilities in the Eurostat case .
I also believe that it is essential that the principle of political responsibility should be implemented , in practical terms .
Any modernisation of state social security systems must , therefore , take this fact into account .
It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity .
What would it mean , then , if the Convention 's conclusions were imposed as final , as the rapporteurs would like , riding roughshod over the powers and responsibilities democratically granted only to the Intergovernmental Conference ( IGC) ?
Let us remember , moreover , what happened some weeks ago at the IGC planning meeting in Riva del Garda .
It amounts to a negation of the 'concrete achievements ' which gradually 'create a de facto solidarity ' .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Convention has presented its responses to the questions posed at Laeken in the form of a draft Constitution .
It can and should be fine-tuned , as long as its basic equilibrium is maintained .
The Convention was not simply a preparatory phase , as its predecessors were .
They might have laid greater emphasis on our satisfaction with the draft Constitution for Europe , and at the same time warned the Intergovernmental Conference ( IGC ) of the responsibility it
