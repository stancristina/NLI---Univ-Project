and I fear they will not be the last - as you , Commissioner , reminded us , provide us with the opportunity to discuss the imperative need to supplement European legislation .
Therefore , we must keep tabs on the application of these directives and reinforce European coordination .
All this confirms our conviction that something like sanctions , which we reiterated were very important when we gave our opinion on the information and consultation directive last year , can on no account be abandoned .
Despite the commitment they have shown to the company and despite their high level of professionalism - which has made the Cisterna plant one of the most productive in Europe - these workers are likely to be removed from the production cycle , while Goodyear , after years of benefiting from state and European subsidies , is totally free to walk out .
The Goodyear workers are putting up a magnificent fight , in the knowledge that they are defending not only their own interests but the interests of the Goodyear workers in the different European countries as well , and there are many of them : France , Germany , the United Kingdom , Poland , Luxembourg and Slovenia .
Today , Kosovo has no adequate strategy for protecting minority groups , and these include not only Serbs and Roma , but also moderate Albanians who still believe in the possibility of peaceful coexistence and are persecuted by the extremists in power .
It is not true that Flora Brovina has been abandoned .
This is an admission that confirms all our concerns and makes Parliament ' s position on the case all the more appropriate , as it calls for a concurrent explanation of other cases of journalists who have disappeared in the Chechen region during the conflict and the safeguarding of media coverage of a conflict that has reached unacceptable levels of violence .
One of the reasons for the Community ' s interest is the structural flexibility of this sector of the employment market , which explains its attractiveness for women and young people , to whom it often offers their first experience of employment .
Secondly , I would like to explode a myth , taking as a starting point an apparent paradox , which is clearly highlighted by Eurostat figures : the main international tourist countries are not those traditionally regarded as tourist destinations , but on the contrary the most advanced nations , whose quality of life is one of their main attractions and most heavily promoted features .
This does not follow automatically : often in the past a great deal of wealth has been accumulated thanks to the promotion of the tourist industry , without this being matched by an increase in employment .
We feel that the European Union and the Commission needs to make a strong commitment to sustainable tourism , which means having a strategy that is compatible with the environment , after the excesses of recent years when private wealth often did not correspond to high levels of employment .
All the European States are known throughout the world for being tourist magnets envied by all , including the United States of America , which we spoke about this afternoon with regard to the native Americans .
This type of tourism must be promoted and supported because it allows people to work in tourist destinations , not just during the summer when we go swimming in the sea , for example , but also during winter when we go to take the air .
Fortunately , the Italian Government and the President of the Republic intervened , and today the Italian Ambassador to Germany will also speak on the subject , to call on the German Chancellor not to interfere in Italian internal affairs , in so far as there are no neo-fascist candidates for government office .
I am sure Commissioner Bolkestein will listen carefully to all Parliament 's comments .
The aim is to ensure that the internal market in postal services functions smoothly in the interests of consumers and businesses throughout the European Union .
That should amply compensate them for forgoing their contact with the postman .
Let us all go back to our respective nations and shout from the rooftops that our belief in democracy and our indignation are not just words , but a demonstration of our actual political commitment .
One : definition of political priorities and translation of these into practical measures through the focused use of resources .
This was the impression I received when I first became President of the Commission , and it has been confirmed by observation during my daily work .
We are going to create a management and control system in every Directorate-General .
The Commission has been accused of being buried under piles of paper , and so we are going to become a paperless Commission .
Now we can focus on the future , on the challenges awaiting the Union and on the programme for 2000-2005 , the contents of which we have outlined to you over the past few weeks .
In September , we undertook to present a White Paper on reform , and today we are fulfilling that undertaking according to the conditions established in your presence .
I believe that we will have to reach a compromise in this area between those who , rightly , are pushing for the communitisation of this policy and those who think that such advances should be the responsibility of the Intergovernmental Conference .
In any case , it is prevention that I would like to discuss today .
I would also like to know whether , in this context , it would not be possible to do something to induce the Iraqi Government to take a humanitarian step and to release some information regarding the 615 missing Kuwaitis , or to set them free if this is within their power .
