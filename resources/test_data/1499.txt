most of you here probably know - will expire in the 2000/2001 financial year .
Since the issue of moisture content has been raised here today , I should like to point out that the price of cereals might have been fixed in Berlin , but not the price of water ! 14.5 % is the maximum moisture content which traders customarily accept nowadays .
However , this was rejected by Parliament .
This report will not only cover fresh fruit and vegetables but also processed fruit and vegetables , and therefore processed tomatoes .
Since flax and hemp are mainly grown for non-food purposes and no surpluses are produced , there should be no set-aside obligation , because set-aside serves as an instrument to regulate markets where surpluses are possible .
But if you introduce processing aid , where , in your view , fraud cannot be committed - and incidentally it can actually , but let us assume for now that it cannot - then the result might be that the raw material is grown outside the EU and imported .
You see we are not under any illusions !
In my opinion , they are actually no longer necessary because there is land all over the place within the surface area on which flax and hemp can be grown without limiting the amount of other crops that are cultivated .
We can only accept investment in products which are profitable under market conditions .
But this would mean that the aid per hectare for the next marketing year would have to be set this year in accordance with the system currently in force .
Mr President , with your permission I should like to ask the Commissioner a supplementary question .
First of all , however , and before looking back , I wish to take a look into the future .
Obviously , we cannot in any way change either the law which has to be applied or the legal jurisdiction , but by now proposing a system whereby each insurer has a claims representative in every other country , we will probably be able , as far as the accident victim is concerned , satisfactorily to settle the claims arising from 90 % of all traffic accidents which take place in another country .
Of course , the rapporteur also referred to this .
It comes with definite expectations for the future , including securing law and order in all parts of the country .
The South African Government needs all sections of society to have lasting confidence in the development of the country .
Thirdly , and this is a particular matter of concern to me , we have strengthened the European Parliament as the institution which represents the interests of the citizens of Europe .
Fourthly , we must take account of the increase in the responsibility of the European Parliament since the Amsterdam Treaty entered into force .
We shall have to discuss this again in September during the first reading of this budget , once all the documents from the budget discharge procedure have been submitted .
That is not enough ; it is the work beforehand which is crucial and it needs to be carried out seriously and it needs to be carried out well .
And it is needed .
We are in favour of discussing this during the course of the year , but we are expressly against saying as of now that we refuse to fill the 35 posts .
More importantly , I think it is most helpful to present the preliminary draft budget so early , thereby allowing time for intensive discussion .
This is mainly as a result of the resolutions passed by the Heads of State and Government at the Berlin Summit last year and these agreed financial perspectives form part of the interinstitutional agreement concluded last year between the Parliament , the Council and the Commission .
We have already discussed whether these countries are able to absorb this figure in the trialogue debate with the Council .
Of course , all Member States will be included and the money will be refunded in the ratio to which the Member States finance the European Union budget .
The debate and the budgets which we have voted in the past demonstrate this and that is the way it should stay .
If you look at the Culture and Audiovisual Media heading , there is a 2.7 % increase .
The report has been available for some time and I therefore see no reason why we cannot debate and vote on it .
I have therefore taken recourse to Rule 181 of the Rules of Procedure and proposed an amendment to the Rules of Procedure .
The legal basis for this is in place .
The report also includes a number of points from the White Paper on the reform of the Commission in connection with OLAF .
Right from the outset , legislative texts are often worded differently and allow perfectly legal but differing definitions of fraud .
I know it is difficult to impart ideals and virtue to another person .
We want an even more proactive approach and are therefore waiting for the Commission to present proposals for the first stage of a European public prosecutor ' s office on the basis of the current Article 280 and I really do hope , Commissioner Schreyer , that you will revise your unfortunately somewhat wait-and-see attitude and accommodate us here .
The fight against fraud includes activities such as preventing , uncovering and prosecuting customs and subsidy fraud or tax evasion , as well , of course , as uncovering and prosecuting irregularities within the institutions of the European Union .
The Commission explained that it also shared Parliament ' s view that confidence in the objectivity of disciplinary proceedings would be enhanced by involving an outside agency
