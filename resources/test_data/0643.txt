I agree with that in principle , but we must not regard this as some kind of miracle solution , as new questions are arising in connection with double-hull ships .
When it comes to handling emergencies , I think that it would be a good thing if we were to have a proper European coastguard .
I think , Commissioner , and I assume you are in agreement with me on this , that the role of the European Union in the international organisation must be strengthened .
It makes no sense to automatically tow ships 200 miles offshore , as this does not reduce the risk .
In my opinion , and , I hope , in the opinion of most of this Parliament , this man is not a criminal , but he is being treated as one .
Then there is the wreckage .
As the leaks are small , no oil will be brought up to the surface this coming winter ; this will be done in the spring .
I will try to find a compromise tonight or possibly tomorrow morning .
The next step is naturally for the European Commission to build on this and for the Council of Transport Ministers to provide the necessary support .
This would require European shipowners and European flag states to dismantle their ships properly .
For some , this report means the end of the Parliamentary debate on the matter of the 'Prestige ' . There is much that we do not yet know , however ; there are many questions that remain unanswered , and that is disappointing .
We would have to mobilise all the Community resources to obtain compensation .
I would like to mention that there were very great differences in the openness shown by the various maritime authorities concerned .
The European Agency for Maritime Safety is being given the mandate and the resources to act .
These facts reopen the whole discussion .
This cannot be permitted , something must be done about this !
It is a logical step to call for new rules and measures .
Of great importance is the designation of safe have ns , as well as the use of reception installations for excess oil in ports , which presuppose adequate payment schemes that are uniform throughout the European Union for effective use .
What has become of this willingness to take action ?
What we need is a task force .
This is the information I have .
The first problem is the proposal 's legal basis .
A directive aims to provide direction and offer a solution .
If this new directive is implemented properly and enforced consistently , Europe can avoid situations of the kind experienced in California .
The Commission would like to increase this obligation , but fails to make it clear why a higher stock level is necessary .
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , nobody denies the fact that , given the EU 's considerable dependence where the provisioning of natural oil products is concerned , initiatives must be taken to guarantee the continuity of supply of these products .
It would , in my view , take more than setting up a new body .
Mr President , the large-scale misuse of asylum is a very serious problem in the European Union , and it would therefore be misplaced to discuss ad infinitum the gender of angels .
Well , it makes no sense whatsoever , on the one hand , to use a list of safe third countries and , on the other , to treat the files originating from those countries in exactly the same manner as the other files .
We must have the courage to conclude and recognise that the Geneva Convention needs to be overhauled .
Although direct flights are always preferable , this is not always possible in practice .
This is a third-pillar procedure in which a Member State takes the initiative and Parliament has only an advisory role .
The difference between the two was the use of language .
I expect Mr Trichet to continue to follow this line in the future and to be consistent when it comes to the execution of the rules and to speak out clearly on this matter in Paris too .
The aim of this proposal is to harmonise the European regulations .
The Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy is of the opinion that the directive must be strictly limited to unambiguous cases .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the subject we are discussing here is a difficult subject .
I believe that it is necessary to put an end to this by way of this directive , if we get it .
I would like to see a number of improvements implemented , however .
I think that would be a bad thing .
Article 52 of the European Patent Convention excludes software as such and states that ideas and theories are not suitable for patents .
There is a good deal of disquiet among small - and medium-sized enterprises and the open source movement .
Regrettably , this discussion has actually been overtaken by the practices of the European Patent Office .
This is inherent in the patent system .
We also often lag behind reality ; you just have to look at what is happening at the European Patent Office .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there has been heavy lobbying around this report because there is much at stake .
Well , here is the proof that we are not .
More legal certainty and uniform application of the legal rules in the internal market are things small - and medium-sized enterprises have a particular need of .
It is an amendment which I submitted myself , because although the two main groups had
