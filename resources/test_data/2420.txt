The most urgent measures , on which my colleague Mr Vitorino is working , include the introduction of a European arrest warrant to replace current extradition procedures and the adoption of a common definition of terrorism .
They will gain a better understanding of what an internal market can offer , one that is made up of almost 400 million citizens and consumers , 300 million of which will use the single currency .
We now have to implement , on a day-to-day basis , the road map the European Council adopted at Nice , based on the principle of differentiating between candidate states .
Let me just point out here that at a very early stage the Commission highlighted the importance , in view of preparing the future institutional reforms , of involving the various sources of democratic legitimacy that coexist in Europe and of preparing for these reforms as openly and transparently as possible .
Through political union , through economic and monetary union , and also through certain major common policies such as the one for which I am responsible , cohesion , European integration must lead towards solidarity between peoples and nations , the stability of the continent , the balanced development of its entire territory and its regions .
Furthermore , at international level , we urgently need to set up the International Criminal Court , a process that has been underway for several years but is now marking time .
Much has been said about air safety and security , many measures have been taken at European level .
There has been much criticism of certain statements that were made .
That brings me to my main point .
We have to draw all the necessary conclusions from that , discard outdated points of view , give priority to security , review all the old strategies that are no longer appropriate and begin by admitting that controls do not prejudice freedom of movement ; while they harm criminals they protect citizens ' freedoms .
I believe we have to remember that .
Those are the ideas now on the table .
Let me highlight something that has emerged from our debates and to which I too am paying close attention .
It is true that we will have to be very vigilant here too ; in other words , sometimes we must not forget that countries , organisations and bodies that form part of the coalition should also , to some extent , render account for some of their own practices , forms of behaviour and policies .
Mr Dupuis spoke of the effectiveness of the secret services .
I heard them clearly .
The European Council showed that it was able to draw the consequences of the fight that lies ahead .

Mr President , at the close of this debate let me thank all the speakers , although I will not be able to reply to each one individually in the few minutes that remain .
Let me say , on behalf of the Commission , that I was touched by the support several of you gave to the work we are doing during these difficult and serious times , side by side with the Council and the European Parliament .
And then , of course , in the shorter term , there are the support and cooperation measures to help the refugees .
Lastly , I believe that this convention must not confine itself to setting out the options but must be authorised or take it upon itself to make proposals .
To avoid the unnecessary extra costs involved in roll-call votes , we will withdraw our first two amendments and only adhere to the third one , Amendment No 3 , which in our view suffices to show the sad state of affairs at present .
Over and above these practical imperatives , we can really only combat euro-noise today if we do so at European Community level .
I am not calling the general objective into question ; but if our action is to be effective , it must be pragmatic , like the action we took on air quality .
Furthermore , the first stage would be to set up a system for evaluating noise levels in the different Member States and to draw exact noise maps region by region .
Furthermore , we refuse to join in the congratulations addressed to the French authorities .

It would also do better to present us with proposals aimed at giving priority to assisting refugees in their region of origin .
How many Bosnians are still mouldering in refugee camps in Turkey because the Union has refused to take them in ?
It is obviously in the immigrants ' interest to adjust to our way of life and our values .
Terrorist cells have recently been identified in various Member States of the Union , in particular in France and Belgium , among illegal immigrants .
- ( FR ) The debates that have just taken place in the present session on the Pirker report , and indeed on the Evans report , represent a double departure from the debates previously held within the European Parliament on the same subjects .
Remember that the GALILEO project is intended to deploy a set of satellites orbiting about 20 000 km above the Earth .
In its explanatory statement , the report not only preaches the promotion of 'entrepreneurship at the educational level ' but also says that 'obstacles to mobility arising from social security systems should be removed ' .
Innovation cannot exist without the SMEs .
The Europeans should have left for the sake of their honour and dignity , which would have sent out a strong and salutary signal to the UN and its General Secretariat and
