we have exercised Community competence .
Earlier someone , I think it was Mr Ortuondo Larrea , was talking about the European Maritime Safety Agency , and certifying systems to monitor the issue of bilges and emptying tanks and also , in order to combat these types of measures .
Afghanistan is a country that needs not just political and social reconstruction but also economic reconstruction .
We are convinced that the enormous challenge of developing these neighbouring regions can only be possible , in terms of European responsibilities , if we combine responsibility and management .
And in this case , I believe that the Commission has done that , although perhaps rather belatedly .
From a legal point of view , that mechanism does not exist .
Given the special issues pertaining to 2004 , the structured dialogue will take the form of a meeting of the Commission and the Conference of Committee Presidents to be held in April .
These , therefore , are our objectives .
Furthermore , 2005 will be a key year as regards concluding the negotiations on the adoption of the package for subsequent financial perspectives .
At international level , the focus in 2005 will largely remain on issues relating to international security and stability , the fight against terrorism and the rebuilding of Iraq .
The second is security and European citizenship .
It is essential to remember that enlarging Europe both in terms of its territory and of its population will call for additional effort and greater coordination .
The new dimension of the European  Union , the new post-enlargement external borders mean there must be a stable and comprehensive political framework encompassing our neighbours to the south and east .
I would , however , like to make it clear to you that the situation regarding these two issues is currently both critical and delicate , as she will explain in a few moments ’ time .
For the first time , Parliament is going to implement a budgetary year in the light of the evaluation report based on the annual policy strategy document .
We would like the political priorities of what is to be financed to be absolutely clear before any ceilings are fixed .
We would have welcomed the Council’s presence .
Mr Liikanen has worked hard on this over the years .
There are proposals to improve and simplify legislation relating to key industrial sectors .
We all hope and expect it will be .     – Mr President , I am sure anyone would like to enjoy eternal youth , and that the honourable Members of this House are no exception to that rule .
Provision has been made for this in a range of policies .
Much remains to be done in that regard in the wider world , however .
Commitments were made to Afghanistan and will obviously be honoured .
Moving on to the Lisbon Agenda , you are quite right , ladies and gentlemen .
I think the same is true of other areas too .
The European Union sorely needs these reforms .
This has been clearly stated today , notably by the Commission .
I believe that was the majority view enshrined in our stance on the Convention .
Opinions have changed .
Another important aspect is involved .
The Irish Presidency will be responsible for launching that debate too .
In France , my home country , and elsewhere in the European  Union researchers are out on the streets demonstrating .
Lastly , on the occasion of the visit of an Iranian Nobel Prize winner to this House , I would like to say that I believe the Union must stand firm in its support of democracy in Iran .
In my view , widespread application of cleaner technology is one solution , precisely because it would facilitate the reduction of polluting emissions .
I should also like to thank them for the ideas they put forward .
Essentially , the key issue arising at present is whether the Lisbon diagnosis remains valid or not .
On the other , rather less has been achieved concerning productivity .
It is , however , important to put discussion of research and development into context .
That implies a certain appropriate degree or level of social protection .
With regard to fiscal policy acting as a discretionary element to improve growth in the short term , it might indeed serve as such in some cases , at least in theory .
I also believe this fiscal framework calls for budgetary balance to be achieved in the medium term , given the difficulties anticipated and the ageing population .
It is important not to focus on fiscal consolidation .
We feel the problem of the future is extremely important .
I feel the starting point is sound .
These were endorsed at the Essen and Dublin European Councils , and the Commission has proposed a second enlargement .
They are vital for the economic development of the European  Union .
They are the words of the United Nations Organisation , the UN.
We do , however , want it to be a contribution from the world of sport to the rest of the world .
In the real world there are neutral parties .
Our group has presented and defended amendments in the Committee on Budgets in particular on the issue of multilingualism and its implementation .
Nevertheless , because of the opposition of other political groups , and particularly yours , Mr Kuckelkorn , this has not been possible and therefore the compromise solution proposed in the amendment of the Greens/ALE Group seems to us to be acceptable as the only way to avoid jeopardising this transfer , which must be carried out in 2004 , in this budgetary year .
It is not enough for all of us to sit here saying how very worried we are ; we must really prove this through action .
To do so we need greater cooperation between youth organisations and public authorities .
