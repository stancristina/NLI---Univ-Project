Mr President , the Amsterdam Treaty certainly provides new tools for improving equality , and must be regarded as a gain for women in general .
The family image of the European Union is still a bunch of men in grey suits , with Queen Beatrix in the middle and a couple of female foreign ministers , and that is all .
This could include the idea of imposing temporary quotas to ensure better representation of women or of the under-represented gender .
They must be studied and that is precisely why mainstreaming is a doubleedged sword .
It requires a great deal of careful attention .
In preparing for monetary union it is especially important to promote equality and the status of women , because , as Mrs' Kokkola 's report states , adapting public finance to EMU conditions may hit women badly .
I hope that the excellent measures outlined in the report will also be implemented .
I believe that experience of quotas in the Finnish Equality Act will show the way .
I really must bemoan the fact that , despite Community legislation and national laws in many countries , the implementation of equal pay is still a long way off .
Similarly , effective methods for job evaluation must be adopted to enable us to reassess jobs in the underpaid , female-dominated sectors .
So the proportion of women on decision-making bodies must also be increased immediately at the regional level .
Without a national viewpoint committed to protecting the environment , politicians will turn a deaf ear to environmental demands .
It is also justified to extend aid to cover the work the agencies are doing in cooperation with central and eastern European countries .
One of the biggest problems with countries applying for EU membership is how EU regulation levels are to be achieved , and that is particularly so with the environment .
The Member States and our citizens are affected by everything that happens on our borders .
From north to south there are border zones where environmental problems , along with poverty , are burning issues .
Actually , I heard from the interpretation that the person who made the suggestion was English .
An ECU invested there would yield more , through the environmental agencies , the EU or the various Member States , than anywhere else .
Mrs Flemming , in her otherwise excellent report , slipped in a rather dubious amendment in the final part .
In my opinion , this is a very bureaucratic amendment .
Mr President , colleagues , the commission has finally produced this long-awaited Green Paper on the retail trade .
But how is it possible that , with unemployment the biggest nightmare in the union area , we are worsening the situation by taking away the better service of the corner shop and replacing it with pollution-making supermarkets .
Besides , are n't the hypermarkets starting to remind you of those special boxes they use for rat experiments , with their one-way corridors and automatic doors ?
The corner shop should also be a part of that famous principle of community spirit .
Corner shop services could diversify into postal services , computer networking facilities and meal services for the elderly and disabled .
Thus employment and the quality of life both improve simultaneously .
We must invest in aid to the retail trade through structural funding right away also because the sector employs more women than men , which is obviously right .
But electronic shopping at the moment favours existing supermarkets , not small village shops .
Mr Garosci 's report also touches on how , when there is a common currency for Europe , it will be just that retail sector which will be affected in the most obvious way .
When discussing the single currency and its preparatory stage we should not forget , however , along with shop workers , bank staff who will be doing all the practical work leading up to the single currency , and this under the threat of future unemployment We would be taking it out of one pocket to put it in the next if we aided women 's employment in retail and at the same time witness perfectly able women bank employees in their forties and fifties being relegated to the dole queues .
For example , the concentration of supermarkets in Finland is driven by the tyranny of big business , where local shops cannot use regional sub-suppliers , but have to order from central firms just like everyone else .
The uniform supply trends we are seeing now do not grant the customers freedom of choice , and retail as it is cannot grow .
As is evident from the report , the role of these firms as employers is vitally important , and continues to grow .
The question is how we can improve working conditions for small and medium-size businesses .
An overblown and unnecessary taxation rate often endangers sustained business and can even end it .
The report emphasises quite rightly the importance of and opportunities for co-operatives and calls for European regulation on co-operatives .
For example , in Finland many major companies have their origins in co-operative movements .
This gives support mainly to training , and research and product development .
Unfortunately , sluggish procedures and bureaucracy often prevent small and medium-sized businesses from taking advantage of the support on offer .
Business urgently needs money both for investment and working capital .
That is why it is worth considering whether the system could be developed to cover small and medium-sized business also .
Secondly , the provision would not have distinguished the type of crime it referred to .
Sadly , we have experience of organisations which were peacefully exercising their freedom of speech being convicted by courts .
Particularly considering recent events in Finland , where minks were released from cages at
