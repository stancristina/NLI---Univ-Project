gas into our own available networks .     – Madam President , I would be interested to know how we , or those who come after us , will speak about this problem in ten years ’ time , whether we will have become wiser or not .
We must have better controls and the requirements must be such that they actually can be controlled .
For me , it is quite clear from the title of this directive that environmental protection is one of its priorities .
It is therefore very important that you keep your eyes open here .
They also come from the same firms as make nickel-cadmium batteries , at any rate many have experience with them , and that would be my recommendation , instead of rushing straight to a ban .     – Madam President , Commissioner Wallström , we are indeed using more batteries , and that is causing us problems .
We need a framework for the building site so that these building blocks will fit together and a sensible structure will result .
It is , sadly , the case that in particular it took so serious an accident as that of the tanker finally to improve safety in maritime traffic .
My third and final point is that we are aware that 80 % of all accidents at sea are attributable to human error .
We must therefore think very carefully about where we will apply cross-finance as an instrument .
This represents a first step towards the comprehensive internalisation of the environmental costs , a result not to be underestimated .
Here and now , we have what we always supported in Austria , namely a signal for a new Pan-European transport policy which , in addition to the classic objectives of such a policy , namely traffic capacity , a favourable costs ratio and road safety , the needs of others are also considered , in particular the needs of people who reside and have to live along the European transport routes , and the requirements of the environment and the goals of sustainable development .
The whole question turns on the need for the Commission to make proposals – which , unfortunately , it has not done .
Mr Turmes is right ; in the White Paper , the Commission found that compliance with the regulations on working conditions and rest and driving times in goods transport on roads is only patchy .
The fact my fellow MEPs agreed to reduce the permitted excess of the weekly maximum working time from 20 % to 10 % makes it all the harder for me to understand that in respect of excesses of the maximum driving times , the rest times and cases in which the minimum rest time is not provided they did not follow the percentage reduction .
We can all agree on one thing , namely that social measures essentially have the purpose of improving employment conditions , avoiding distortions of the market and improving safety , and that the directives that we have drafted for this purpose only make sense if they are implemented and monitored .
Why do not all Member States monitor in the same way and why do they not all give the monitoring authorities the same technical facilities that they need ?
I would also like to make a brief personal comment to the Vice-President and discuss her personal contribution .
Mr President , election period or not , we are proceeding with the second reading on the interoperability of toll-collection systems in the European Union , and this is truly a subject that Germans like to address .
That needs to be emphasised too .
That would be a sensible joint solution .
I hope this will have been rectified by the time we next deal with the proposal .
That , indeed , is the way in which the Irish Presidency has addressed this matter , and I should like to take this opportunity to offer a most emphatic vote of thanks for the manner in which you are dealing with this dossier and with the Commission ’s proposal at the present time .
In the realm of budgetary policy , we are well prepared for enlargement .
Allow me to conclude by returning to the discussion that took place on gross national income and to the contributions on that issue .
To this extent , the letter from the six leaders was neither helpful nor in any way expedient in its timing or its content .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as you know , my colleague Michel Barnier has been appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs of the French Republic and has consequently had to leave the Commission .
Thirdly , the Cohesion Fund is to be integrated into both of these measures .
If economic and social solidarity is to be achieved , an efficient cohesion policy will be indispensable .
The fact that 78 % of the financial resources for the reduction of disparities and the improvement of competitiveness factors have been earmarked for the least advanced regions shows that this is a move in the right direction – away from the scattergun approach to support funding towards the targeted use of resources .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , allow me to express my sincere thanks for this debate and particularly for the many constructive contributions I have heard here .
I fully agree with you that we still need a European – and I emphasise European – cohesion policy .
Lastly , for the priority task of enlargement , the Commission is also proposing an increase in pre-accession aid to Turkey , Bulgaria and Romania , as decided by the Council with the support of Parliament .
For next year we need a contingency reserve again to enable us to make funds available for Iraq .
