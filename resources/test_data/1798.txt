It cannot be demonstrated whether these people have spent the last six months in their house , because sometimes it is 60 km from the neighbouring country .
The Commission 's proposed directive is intended to harmonise the conditions for entry and residence for nationals of third countries who intend to enter a Member State for employment reasons .
Madam President , this is just an opinion report .
By requiring that the immigrant has a contract or a firm offer while still in the country of origin , we are thereby regulating access in accordance with the labour market .
Mr President , in order to achieve legislation in the field of immigration at Community level we should pay particular attention to the positive effects of immigration , something we are debating here today .
However , as other rapporteurs from my group have said , we must maintain the Member States ' competence to regulate how many immigrants they can receive to cover the work possibilities .
Mr President , firstly , on a point of order , I believe that immigration policy has many elements and I do not wish to discuss issues such as allocations in this report .
While it is true that the dramatic events taking place practically every day on the southern coasts of Europe are the most visible and newsworthy aspects of illegal immigration , we must not forget that this is a phenomenon with many other faces .
I believe we could thereby compensate for the sad message which unfortunately we have to send today from the Union to the citizens of that country .
The presentation of this resolution has been delayed considerably as a result of having to convert an initial draft report on the European Union 's relations with Belarus into an own-initiative resolution by the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy due to the deterioration of the situation in terms of the exercise of democracy and respect for human rights in that country .
This is what our proposal is aimed at .
I would particularly express my gratitude for the words of Mr Patten , who , on behalf of the European Parliament , is also going to communicate a message of solidarity to the Colombian authorities in relation to the attack which killed many people in Bogot√° last weekend .
In this way , Mr President , I believe we will be able to respond to the difficult situations being experienced by certain Latin American countries and create an extensive range of relations between our two regions which should culminate - and this is what Parliament wants - in the coming summit of Heads of State in Mexico , and we hope that these agreements can lead the way to a strategic and bi-regional partnership which will result in this global partnership we want to see .
Of these populations , the Mapuche people , in percentage terms , are the most significant .
However , the Commission does not believe that the system of ecopoints is a valid long-term system for resolving the problems of traffic associated with sensitive regions .
I would simply like to point out to certain Members that we need a quick resolution , because the current transitional situation ends on 31 December 2003 .
In Mr Caveri 's proposal there are points which take the same approach as the principle for agreement proposed by the Danish Presidency on 31 December .
That would also raise problems .
I would like to say to you that the real solution is to build the Brenner , to build the Lyon-Turin , that intermodality truly be established .
I would once again like to congratulate Mr Caveri on the difficult work he has done in trying to seek a formula acceptable to everyone and , in any event , the Commission will , of course , take very good note of what Parliament says as always and will try to include these elements in the basis of an agreement acceptable to Parliament and to the Council .
On the contrary , it is demonstrating willingness and carrying out a positive analysis of the Commission 's proposal , of the proposals in the White Paper , and we believe that the enormous majority of its offers and analysis can be perfectly endorsed by this Parliament .
And therefore competitiveness is being seriously harmed .
It is true that European asymmetry is not properly considered in the White Paper , that urban issues have not been dealt with since they are considered subsidiary and not to be subject to the Commission 's proposal , that public transport is not yet properly dealt with - and we are asking the Commission for complementary documents - that enlargement is not really taken into account in the White Paper , but if Europe wants to participate in the process of globalisation and not wait for others to implement it and , if it wants to be as viable as possible , it must have better transport .
The analysis we have presented in the White Paper has been debated in depth , also by the industry and the sectors mostly affected .
In this regard , I hope that the Van Miert Group , which is considering a global revision of the trans-European networks in view of enlargement , that is , a Europe of twenty-seven - because it includes the countries with which negotiations are either completed or at an advanced stage - will achieve a good result before the end of the Greek Presidency and that the document can therefore be presented during the Italian Presidency .
In this field , we will also present important proposals on the control of road transport in relation to the identification of motorway black spots .
I believe we are working in the
