will prove to be extremely useful in the future .
But before commenting in further detail on this report , I would like to share with you the recent developments which have occurred with regard to the Fifth Framework Programme , which is currently under discussion within the European Parliament and the Council .
However , it would particularly affect the Joint Research Centre , which would find itself deprived of the means to accomplish its mission in the service of the Union regarding policies on which a consensus had nevertheless been achieved .
Its aim is to give , with the help of as many precise factual details as possible , an overall view of the Union 's activity in the area of research and technological development over the period covered , including projects initiated , results obtained and developments prepared .
By definition , the Union 's research policy is for the citizens of Europe .
With a view to facilitating the participation of SMEs in the Framework Programme , increasing the efficiency of actions which concern them and reducing delays , accredited but not exclusive information and assistance networks will be developed by strengthening and rationalizing the existing structures .
This is based on the experiences of the task forces and will be developed within the Fifth Framework Programme .
Nevertheless , to encourage optimal preventive action on the part of employers , the most practical obligation to reduce risk to a minimum must be maintained when the complete elimination of all risk is impossible .
Mr President , Parliament made the right choice at first reading .
In my opinion the figures must be made compulsory so that our industries can be clear on the issue and define their strategies for development accordingly .
Indeed , all the studies carried out up until now have unambiguously demonstrated that ionization of food products poses no risk whatsoever to the health and safety of the consumer .
In such conditions , wisdom would suggest that all of the amendments are accepted and submitted to the vote , in the knowledge that some will not be voted for .
This is merely a temporary measure , pending a satisfactory solution .
This would be very pleasant and would encourage us greatly .
It is on the condition of these three points that our group will approve a text which explicitly includes the military solution as the only one capable of lending credibility to diplomatic pressure .
It has destroyed production and trade channels and at the same time reinforced the links between Saddam Hussein and his people .
There are no more spare parts .
It is all the more terrible in that it is perpetrated coldly , calmly and clinically and has operated down the years under the cover of moral pacifist motivations which claim human rights as their inspiration .
They do this in the light of their individual histories and respective sensibilities , and these are not identical .
Today I note that Europe has been obliterated , as spectacularly indicated , Mr Mar√≠n , by the terseness of your remarks earlier .
For example , those who applauded will be registered as being present and those who did not applaud will not .
At first reading , the European Parliament adopted a large number of amendments which aim to strengthen the standards proposed by the Commission .
All too often our fellow citizens see Europe as being too distant or too restrictive .
The introduction of oxygen from fossils or plants should also be encouraged , given its positive and immediate effect on air quality .
So when we have set new standards , we must reach them before proposing more .
It is a matter of great urgency that we combat the greenhouse effect and atmospheric pollution in our towns .
European institutions must give greater attention to the pollution caused by the number of old cars on the road .
This is why we will defend the emission limits proposed by Mr Lange .
Lastly , and I will end here , the key point which Parliament must deal with is the issue of increasing the proportion of newer cars on our roads .
The Commission is proposing to set up a specific independent committee which it will be able to rely on when proposing to the Council amendments to the current directive on the ionization of foodstuffs .
Today 's report must present us with the opportunity to debate what lies at the root of all changes in European legislation on the environment , that is , the collection and distribution of objective and accurate information gathered in all the countries of the Union .
There are some issues concerning China which are quite worrying .
I call on the Council and the Member States to list Algeria amongst the priorities for debate at the next session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and remain convinced that sending a special rapporteur does not represent a punishment or a condemnation of this country .
In order to promote democracy and transparency , an organization should be set up to facilitate public dialogue and to enable all the social players to participate in the orientation of and decisions concerning this sector .
There is a real legal vacuum in terms of recognition of registration plates by the Member States of the European Union .
This is not the case , however , for the amendments from Brian Simpson , because here they seem to me to complicate and weigh down the proposal for a regulation and my report .
This is why , in the desire to maintain clarity and simplification , I cannot accept Amendments Nos 11 and 12 from Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf relating to the list of components and their proportions , since obligations are already defined in this area .
