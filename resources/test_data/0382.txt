shall not keep saying that I am disappointed , because you need to hope in order to be disappointed .... and I have had no hope since the investiture debate .
The nature of the EU has not changed .
It is most worrying , especially as a similar agreement with Mexico appears to be taking shape .
After years of 'good and loyal service ' it is still the main symbol of efforts by the European Union to promote development and improve the lot of the poorest countries .
But we must also preserve the original spirit of the Lom√© Convention , which has enabled relations between the European Union and the ACP to become what they are today : a real partnership based on fairness and mutual respect .
Exemplary because it proves that the Balkan countries are not at the mercy of fate and that those of them which so wish are already in a position to meet the standard requirements imposed by the European Union in stability and association agreements .
First , draft a very accurate report on the implementation of the collective redundancies and European works council directives and use all the pressure , warnings and sanctions needed in order to ensure that they are applied to the letter .
However , what we witnessing today is the phenomenon of concentration and corporate regrouping and relocation , with all the familiar consequences , both on the quality of products and at the social level , especially in terms of unemployment , difficult working conditions and increased flexibility : consequences which have a drastic effect at the human level , especially on the family unit .
Women and children were beaten .
That is my conclusion today .
We do not the extent to which far-right commandos were to blame and how far the common people stupid enough to follow these commandos were to blame .
I also noted a mistake in the compromise motion for a resolution , which you no doubt overlooked .
Yet he is taken hostage and treated as a prisoner of war .
If we want to help the Cambodians with the task of reconciliation on which they have embarked , we need to try and sentence those responsible at the highest level and thus exonerate the simple underlings and all those who were willingly or forcibly dragged along behind them .
It must form the basis for our partners ' political will .
Moreover , it is all just words , because the Socialist governments , which are now in a majority in Europe , are just as incapable of taking action to prevent redundancies as right-wing governments .
Tourism must be environmentally friendly if it is to continue to be an asset in the future .
Vocational training and a mobile workforce are important tools in the strategy to fight unemployment in Europe especially , as far as tourist service providers are concerned , in meeting multicultural demands and ensuring that services are tailored to customers .
The President wishes to specify that under no circumstances does she sanction the terms of this "declaration " .
Let us point out that Parliament ' s positions were clearly defined and that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance supported them .
We do not think so .
In fact , Article 86 of the EC Treaty , formerly Article 90 , stipulates that services of general economic interest are subject to the rules on competition only insofar as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance of the particular tasks assigned to them .
As you know , in our country , each village has its own local post office or at least a post box , with a collection every day .
If revenue is lost , then public interest operations will be revised and cut , and again it is in rural areas that the most swingeing cuts will be made .
The sudden reduction of these limits poses a threat to the balance between the obligation to provide a public service and economic viability for postal services .
All people , regardless of their location or social status , must have access to the postal service on an equal footing and subject to the same conditions .
I should add that today , at a time when Europe is revealing itself and is proving to be incapable of opposing the inclusion of Fascists in a government within the European Union , it is no longer acceptable to have an ultraliberalism which destroys public services foisted on us in the name of this same Europe .
A man with three children and he was murdered .
Furthermore , in the autonomous defence capability that you propound , if what you claim as a defence capability to be mobilised is only too clear , as it involves on average the doubling of the expenditure invested in the military field , its autonomy is , on the contrary , much more of a problem , judging by the degree of NATO , and therefore United States ' , involvement in European decisions on defence that one part of the Council and , it would seem , you personally , wish for .
Mr President , Mr Solana , we are very uneasy about replying to you because , in our view , you are responsible for an area that does not really exist .
Of course , in reality , they are the same thing .
We also have several questions to ask you that show our concern , that is the least one can say .
So the time has come and I would ask Mr Solana and Mr Patten to tell Mr Michel that perhaps he is going a bit too far and that finally it may backfire on him , which is what I hope will happen .
