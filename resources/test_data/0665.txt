For a long time to come we will be aiming rather at speedier cooperation between customs systems than at a separate common customs system - not least because there are still very sensitive issues associated with the external borders .
It is also important to remember that , when the common data banks are set up which are essential in the fight against fraud , data protection will be needed to prevent these data banks being removed from the citizens ' control and used against them .
I hope this is the beginning of better cooperation between the police and home affairs authorities on the one hand and the health and social authorities on the other .
There is a need for cooperation projects between the different authorities .
The starting point of drugs policy must be clear : society does not approve of drugs .
' Legal drugs ' ( tranquillizers ) finding their way on to an illegal market , especially when used in combination with alcohol , are a major and serious problem particularly for young people .
Further research is also needed .
This accident brought to light that there are numerous power stations in the former Soviet Union built with the same technology and with a highly unreliable safety record .
Some of these are very close to Finland , in Karelia and other neighbouring areas .
The Finnish energy supply authorities consider that we need to build a fifth nuclear power station .
It is therefore particularly important that the European Parliament debate this issue and appeal to the Commission and Council , and that every possible means be used to try and minimize the threat from Chernobyl-type nuclear power stations .
As I have said , there is a great deal of opposition in Finland at present to nuclear power , which in practice prevents any further nuclear power stations from being built .
This would increase the security of gas supply throughout the whole of Northern Europe , the Baltic States and other Member States of the European Union , and would accordingly reduce the need for nuclear power .
In my opinion this Northern Gas Network should be added to the EU 's Europe-wide gas networks .
Marjatta SteniusKaukonen has tabled an amendment to the opinion on the abovementioned gas network .
The European Union is also a full member of the area 's central cooperation bodies , particularly the Baltic Council and the Baltic Protection Commission ( Helcom ) .
It need not think that it would have to start building up such a programme from scratch , for cooperation has been established in the area for a long time and is indeed based on a centuries-old tradition .
The region 's own expertise and existing development programmes should be exploited and an attempt made to coordinate them .
The Baltic region also needs to build up a comprehensive environment programme on the basis of sustainable development .
The Commission is due to assume the presidency of Helcom at the beginning of July and this will provide an excellent opportunity , nay , an obligation , to carry out this task .
The region has considerable energy resources , even though it also has major problems .
In this new initiative which the Commission has proposed , all the various points of view , from environmental policy to security issues and economic development , should be brought together .
The Commission is not offering any new resources , but is proposing a better exploitation of current cooperation and programmes .
It notes that the crude oil pipeline from Russia to Finland , together with the linking of the EU 's and the associated countries ' electricity and gas networks , should be a subject of development .
Simply having a positive attitude to this issue is not sufficient .
In conciliation on energy networks Parliament 's proposal for a northern gas network - the Nordic Gas Grid project - was unfortunately omitted from the project list .
We gather that the Commission will begin updating the annex to the list as early as the middle of June , by which time Parliament and the Council will hopefully have adopted the proposals of the Conciliation Committee on energy networks .
In Amendment No 6 I propose that the Nordic Gas Grid project be included as soon as possible on the list of Europe-wide projects in the common interest .
However , I should like to repeat once again that the northern gas network is not only an important project for the Finns but is important for the protection of gas supplies throughout the whole of the trans-European energy networks .
For this meeting the Commission has drawn up its cooperation initiative for the Baltic Sea area , through which it will attempt to support the area 's development in a wide variety of ways .
Preparations for Poland 's membership of the OECD , the three Baltic countries ' membership of the WTO and Special Economic Zone status for the Kaliningrad region will also promote trade and investment in the area in a positive way .
The Commission quite rightly draws attention to the important role of small and medium-sized undertakings in promoting trade cooperation .
Regarding energy cooperation the Commission notes that the proposed gas pipeline from Russia to Germany through Belarus and Poland , and the proposed oil pipeline from Russia to Finland must be the prime objectives .
This gas network permits a good level of security of supply which will benefit not only the Baltic region but the whole of Europe .
Mr President , I should like to put forward two points which I think are important .
The Union must also participate more actively than hitherto in the development of the Barents sea area .
Secondly , if the plans to deepen and enlarge the EU are achieved , this will give rise to a damaging two-way split in
