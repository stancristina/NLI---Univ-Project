Our intransigence - and our right to intervene , Mrs Napoletano - must therefore be tough , even ferocious .
Finally , then , I would urge all Members to staunchly support the motion for a resolution that we have tabled today , which , I think , provides a balanced picture of Parliament ' s views on the situation in Tunisia .
What exactly is the dossier that will be tabled next Sunday , concerning that region ?
The report by the National Council for Liberties in Tunisia estimates the number of policemen at 130 000 for a population of 9.5 million inhabitants .
Given this attitude , we are entitled to wonder if , tomorrow , Tunisia might not become a new hotbed of tension on Europe ' s southern border .
Furthermore , are you able to tell us how the European Union and its partners categorise China ?
Every day , we see and read the same news : further arrests of dissidents , further arrests of members of the Democratic Party and the continued colonisation of Tibet .
That is why it declared that it is in the Union ' s interest to adopt minimum standards for the protection of victims of crime , specifically with regard to access to justice for these victims and their right to compensation , including the reimbursement of their legal fees .
We are already , however , working at a level beyond this framework-decision .
Next , of course , is the foreign policy we need to develop and , finally , the third priority is a real European security and defence policy .
So that reform is also the obligatory route for all future evolution in the construction of Europe .
The Commission hopes the work of the convention drafting this Charter will be completed before the end of the year .
In the area of European security and defence policy , the Commission is happy with the decisions taken since the Helsinki European Council .
In the immediate future , it is essential that all the parties concerned refrain from any act of violence , either inside or outside Lebanon , and cooperate with the United Nations forces .
So , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission , its President and all the commissioners , are naturally determined to deliver what the Council and this House expects of them and to do so within the deadlines .
We will be presenting recommendations to that effect to the Heads of State and Government at Feira and trust they will be followed .
That had to be done , and it was likewise necessary for the report it has just drafted - in addition to being an objective and lucid snapshot of the strengths and weaknesses of the negotiations - to propose going further , without shutting any doors .
What does the political authority , the Council , think of this laissez-faire philosophy ?
Some major issues have appeared on the scene since the conference was launched .
The debate initiated by President Herzog ' s speech must clearly highlight the European Council ' s commitment to the indivisibility of rights and the convention ' s task of drafting a Charter rich in content , which respects the full Cologne mandate , civil and political rights , but also economic and social rights .
In July we will have already drawn up the directives for undertaking these negotiations .
But please , let us respect all the stages and work through them one by one .

Since these colonies became independent , it has intervened to support infamous dictatorships , especially in its former African colonies .
To act effectively we need to establish voluntary cooperation , with variable geometry , where Member States of the Union with an interest in this or that action would participate - and there is no reason why non-member states should not participate too , where appropriate .
If the voice of the poorest countries was finally able to make itself heard last Saturday around 4 a.m. despite pressure of all kinds , we owe that to respect for essential principles , the only guarantees of realistic and moderate international policy , I mean the principles of national sovereignty and equality between States .
As you are aware , the situation in Paraguay is characterised not only by a revolutionary tendency in certain sections of the army but , more generally , by very serious human rights violations and the harsh suppression of popular movements .
In these circumstances , it could be concluded , even before the election , that the election was not valid .
Consequently , we have abstained from voting on this report , but we did vote in favour of the few articles , and especially the amendments , that at least express the idea that the right of asylum should be extended , and we denounce the scandalous nature of the policies of most European States , in particular France , which refuse to recognise this right , especially in the case of refugees from Algeria given the abuses by fundamentalists and the army .
