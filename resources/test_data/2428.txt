been done .
However , in these two years , one of which has been overshadowed by the recession in the United States of America , we have only lagged behind the United States .
Without going over all the sectors one by one , privatisation , the genuine opening up of markets , and the removal of barriers to restructuring in industry and services have still not come about .
Short-term real , but also often imagined , interests have come before the common interest .
In connection with this too is the feeling many foreigners legally resident in many countries in the Union have that they are being discriminated against .
I no longer intend to blame the socialist governments that have been edged aside .
Unless you have the courage to make reforms you can forget the grand words of Lisbon and the future picture of a Europe as the world 's most competitive area !
It is a pleasure for me to praise the political decision-makers in my own country , Finland , for their courage in keeping nuclear energy clearly alongside other forms of development in electrical energy .
It is necessary , because a Europe whose population is ageing should not be turning away immigrants but integrating them in a controlled way as new Europeans .
Enlargement is a huge political and historical event but it is also the biggest objective regarding development cooperation the Member States have ever committed themselves to .
For that reason its success requires mutual cooperation and trust .
The new Member States need support ; the principle whereby they immediately become net beneficiaries is the correct one , as it takes into consideration their solvency rating .
For that reason , phased-in implementation is the right way to proceed .
The price of land is low in these countries .
Does the EU intend to support industrial agriculture in the same way as family farming or is the intention to implement aid and modulations in one form or another that decrease with size ?
If the applicant countries were not to be included , Central and Eastern Europe could see unrest , dictatorships and large-scale uncontrolled migration start to emerge .
These may well be something even bigger than the current policy on immigration or questions of security .
They will represent approximately 5 % of the figure for GNP .
Some very well educated people from the new countries will also be joining us .
We shall be greatly enriched culturally .
We shall also have to deal with a negative tradition : there is no great respect for the law everywhere as , during the time of the Soviet Union , it was interpreted arbitrarily .
Finally , as a solution to the heated argument over Kaliningrad , I would propose that the Russians should go there by train .
I would have asked Commissioner Verheugen about this but he has just gone to the swimming pool .
Many Russians are in favour of this idea .
The states that have applied for membership will start to say from the beginning of autumn that the terms and conditions of membership suit them and at that stage the process will be unstoppable .
The amount they receive in net benefits from the Union will fall .
In connection with enlargement , the insistence that Ireland should hold a new referendum on the Treaty of Nice is putting unreasonable pressure on that country and clearly shows how undemocratic the EU is in its attitude to small Member States .
Mr President , the citizens of the applicant countries now have the chance to participate in the Union 's most important multiannual programmes , and , in fact , many states have started participating in the Socrates , Leonardo and YOUTH programmes .
Some of them are also involved in the Culture 2000 and Media Plus programmes .
It is leading to genuine cooperation and feelings of solidarity between the citizens of the applicant countries and those of the old Member States .
Although the main responsibility for information rests with the governments of the applicant countries and the EU institutions , it would be good if civil society could be involved in letting others know about their experiences .
The Structural Funds must also be used in a way that is as uncomplicated and efficient as possible .
There is much room for improvement here , which is evident , for example , from Mr Turco 's report .
Structural work must adopt the principle of phasing in increased batches of aid .
The particular challenge is not so much the adoption of Community legal provisions but their implementation and monitoring .
Our common aim is to guarantee that all persons , natural and legal , pursing the activity of insurance brokerage are registered by a competent authority on the basis of a minimum set of professional requirements .
Unfortunately the original Commission proposal did not take sufficient account of the diversity of European insurance markets .
It would have imposed an unnecessarily heavy bureaucratic burden on many intermediaries , without increasing customer protection .
Customer protection is a primary value in the insurance business of my home country and , yes , travel agents and car dealers are entitled to sell standardised products .
Nor is it useful for certain Member States to adopt more stringent provisions regarding information requirements , which bring no added value to the customer but merely distort competition between European providers .
The compromise that has been achieved represents the new decision-making culture and is a step forward for dealing with matters faster and more flexibly .
The voluntary agreement will allow us to adopt simple solutions to increase pedestrian safety more quickly .
For this reason a loose framework directive is appropriate .
New technology makes it possible to improve road safety in general and hence also pedestrian safety .
