, the Council gave the Presidency a precise negotiating mandate on 25 April of this year .
On 28 November 2002 , the Council was informed of how far the negotiations concerning a draft had progressed , and due note was taken of this .
In accordance with Article 39 , paragraph 2 of the Treaty on European Union , the Presidency intends to inform Parliament of the negotiations concerning this matter once the negotiations have reached an advanced enough stage for such information to make sense .
With regard to the national parliaments , it is , in accordance with the latter 's own rules , the Member States ' task to inform or consult them .
As far as the Council knows , there is no ammunition of the type referred to in the question and produced in Europe that contains depleted uranium .
Various types of special steel and/or tungsten including wolfram are used for remote-controlled missiles , but not depleted uranium .
I can only repeat that , as far as the Council knows , no ammunition of the type concerned , containing depleted uranium , is produced in Europe .
That is unfortunately outside the scope of the question I have made preparations for answering , so I cannot provide any answer .
Mr President , Parliament has now undertaken the second reading of the 2003 budget , and I note that the agreement reached between Parliament and the Council at the consultancy meeting on 25 November of this year has now been ratified in the 2003 budget .
The Council is , however , able to accept the budget as it emerges from Parliament 's second reading .
I should also like to extend special thanks to the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets , Mr Wynn , and to the budget rapporteurs , Mr FÃ¤rm and Mr Stenmarck .
Thank you for your constructive cooperation and your attention .
Madam President , this is not , unfortunately , the first time that Israel has vandalised religious and cultural monuments and contravened the Venice Charter and all the UNESCO and ICOMOS conventions , without the world 's protesting .
This time , the world 's protests should be as vociferous as they were following the barbaric destruction of the Buddha statues in Afghanistan .
The destruction of these cultural treasures has nothing to do with security and self-defence .
More than three hundred homes face destruction .
It is a disgrace , and the EU must call upon the world community to accept responsibility for stopping the destruction .
Mr President , we were talking a short while ago about the death penalty , and Iran is one of the countries in which many death sentences , especially by means of stoning , are pronounced .
In particular , there were a number of students at the head of the demonstrations and , if I raise the issue now , it is because four of these students were sentenced at a court in Shiraz to have their arms and legs cut off .
None have criminal records .
This is one more example of the mediaeval methods used by Iran .
I would ask you to approach the Iranian Government and , if appropriate , break off the critical dialogue until such methods are no longer used .
Even if the motion for a resolution in this report is adopted , moreover , it will , of course , in itself have no direct legal effects .
In this context , the proposal signifies a development that , in my view , is a threat to democratic control and the rule of law .
The unmistakeable ambition is to develop a supranational border police force in the longer term , one of several steps on the road towards an actual federal police force .
The latter is an obvious consequence of that outside pressure that is due to the prosperity of the EU countries as compared with the wretched social conditions endured by our neighbours , a contrast basically due to the EU countries ' policy , pursued for many years , of exploiting our neighbours .
The content of the motion is no less alarming .
The common legislative body , the system of coordination and operational cooperation , the interoperational facilities and the permanent exchange of information and data , in short the overall development of the police service , does nothing less than dismember that rule of law which , on the basis of experience in the Nordic countries , I see democratic activists as having sought to establish over the years .
What does the Commission have to say about democratic and judicial control ?
How ?
What does the report have to say ?
EU border police and a common body for external borders ?
His report examines rules that will simplify a very complicated area .
The seat behind the wheel in buses and lorries is a back-breaking place of work .
The simple new rules proposed by Mr Markov would ease the burden of work .
It is to be applauded that Parliament can play a part in simplifying the rules .
It is more urgent than ever to cooperate on preventing the increasing violence on our motorways .
This is relevant not only to professional drivers but to all of us who drive on European roads .
The simple new rules would mean that no one could be in any doubt as to when and for how long drivers were required to take rest breaks .
I very much hope that the police would also increase the level of checks they made .
What the ELDR Group is displaying here is penny-pinching at its worst .
Mr President , I too think it good that we obtain clearer rules and that the regulation be revised in such a way as to take account of the changes that have occurred in the transport sector over the last 15 years .
