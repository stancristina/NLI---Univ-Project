I think it is good that radioactive substances have been included in the report .
Like Mrs Grôssetete , I think it is important that we establish the polluter-pays principle and , in this regard , I can support the rapporteur , as well as Mrs Grôssetete ' s amendment .
I hope that , by means of the compromise amendments that have just now been tabled , we can achieve a result that can be translated into effect very quickly and so with no need for any Conciliation Committee procedure .
I am pleased to note that the honourable Member values the initiative , announced by the Commission in its report of the 14 March , whereby an analysis is to be carried out of the way in which the new partnership agreement between the ACP countries and the European Union is affecting the regions on the very periphery of the Union .
The results of the analysis should be available round about the middle of 2001 .
Mr President , I am a strong supporter of cooperation between peoples .
Many problems can only be solved jointly .
Global problems must be solved in the UN.
In Brussels , we have close economic cooperation between the EU and the EEA in connection with a common market .
Would we obtain better democracy by downgrading the national parties and raising the profile of common supranational parties ?
Supranational EU parties are an artificial product which will never be financed through voluntary subscriptions but only by siphoning off EU funds .
It is quite right that the State should support parliamentary work and provide citizens with information .
To quote Grundtvig , doyen of the public education movement in Denmark , there must be 'freedom for Loki as well as for Thor ' .
They will instead be populated by highly paid officials bound to no country in particular - bureaucrats without roots in local political associations .
Manifestos will be written by small groups of experts out of touch with the lives of real people .
An artificial product of that kind does not deserve financial support from the EU.
I think I heard the President-in-Office of the Council say something along the lines that there were agendas for these informal meetings and that these agendas were to be publicly available .
The reason why both Swedish and Danish MEPs are raising these questions is that we have obtained the impression that the Euro 11 is an influential body .
I want to ask whether , in connection with the scenarios that have been gone through , a consensus has emerged that it will not be possible to deal authoritatively with certain types of conflict under the existing Treaty .
This paper from the Commission paves the way for a drastic extension to the opportunities for implementing binding EU legislation .
It is a leap forward in the development of the Union , and that is what is behind my wishing to remind you of a simple fact , namely that the root cause of the asylum problem is social breakdown in countries in the vicinity of the EU.
The EU is the region ' s superpower - economically , politically and militarily .
It is not just a question of passivity and sins of omission .
Do the EU' s institutions and Member States now want to change these basic conditions ?
Is the main message of the Commission ' s working document and of the report we have before us that there is a willingness to do something about the core problem ?
Nor are Christian love of neighbour and human solicitude , or even just general decency , the pivotal factors .
It is not a question of our being obliged to guarantee legal rights to our fellow human beings .
Rather , we ought to be exercising justice in the sense of sharing the burden fairly , with the rich countries giving in accordance with their abilities .
We should not regard refugees as interested parties .
The Feira Summit will give the green light particularly to close cooperation between the most developed and the most federally minded nations .
The pattern is familiar from holding companies where a small majority runs a company which , in turn , runs another company .
Human rights , the arts , transport and foreign and security policy could also become areas for which European bodies such as the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe are responsible .
Nations such as the Baltic and Baltic Sea countries and the countries around the Mediterranean could also join together in different regional groups .
It ought also to be possible for some countries to enter into especially close cooperation but , if this is to happen within the EU' s institutions , everyone must be asked .
Otherwise , cooperation must take place elsewhere .
My group rejects majority decision-making on enhanced cooperation .
I also think that the sanctions against Austria ought to be lifted .
It has almost always been necessary in this House to recall the sound common sense to be found in the Norwegian fell-walkers handbook : ' In the event of a discrepancy between the map and the terrain , it is recommended that you be guided by the terrain' .
The Union train thunders off , taking no account of the terrain .
We have no confidence in the Union project .
Deeper integration , the Treaty which is to become a constitution , the extension to the military , etc .
On 28 September of this year , the Danish people , who have the privilege of being able to vote in referenda , will send out a decisive signal when we vote against joining the euro .
This 'no ' vote will , first of all , mean that our friends and brethren in Sweden and Great Britain
