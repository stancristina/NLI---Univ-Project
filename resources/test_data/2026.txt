In this sense , the Yamal pipeline is an obvious example , given that it supplies Poland , the Czech Republic , Slovakia and Germany via Belarus .
Lastly , Mr President , this regulation represents an historical milestone on the road to gas supply security in the Union and is irrefutable proof of the worthiness of our great integration project .
EudraVigilance will be the only source of information , but the competent authority in the Member State where it is suspected that an adverse reaction has occurred will be informed at the same time , which is very important .
The EU budget deserves exactly the same consideration as national budgets .
We knew that the budget was underfunded in priority areas but we adopted it in order to avoid a discussion in the Council from which there was no way out .
Unfortunately , however , our support is not enough and that is why we need the ministers responsible for the budgets to take on these commitments and agree to make the necessary resources available to the European Union .
We have had to use available margins and the Flexibility Instrument in order to finance such important priorities as Galileo , the Food Facility and the European Economic Recovery Plan .
The lesson that we can learn from this debate is that Parliament is not like a dog whose bark is worse than his bite that will back down at the slightest gesture from the Council : it holds firmly to its positions .
That is why I believe it is very important for Parliament to send a clear message that expects the Commission to fiercely defend the European position and , if necessary , to exercise the reciprocity clause .
However , discretion does not mean acting arbitrarily , because there are rules , limits and criteria , there is a procedure with guarantees and , in any case , there is judicial control .
I support this initiative to help people who have been made redundant by the 82 businesses in Galicia to re-enter the labour market .
Therefore , we must also think about building up a genuine capacity to respond to possible accidents such as the one that occurred in the Gulf of Mexico .
That is what we are discussing : who has to bear the responsibility and the cost of having children , who must also be our future ?
The Estrela report , which has already been adopted by the Committee on Women 's Rights and Gender Equality , is a good point for compromise and consensus , which I believe we should support on Wednesday when we vote .
This is the debate that we will have during the vote on Wednesday .
In this respect , I would like to highlight the importance , for example , of the control functions that this House exercises over the Commission .
This meant that at the same time , it had to be adapted to the new situation , in particular , to Articles 290 and 291 of the treaty , relating to delegated acts and implementing acts .
That is exactly what we are avoiding through this compromise .
Of course , Commissioner , you are the one who is going to have the tools to ensure that this is the case . on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . - ( ES ) Mr President , as this is the first speech today by a Member from my group , please allow me to start by saying , on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left , that we support the French workers who are on general strike against President Sarkozy 's anti-social measures .
Therefore , we are very far from that control , and for those reasons , we are not going to vote in favour tomorrow .
The availability of comprehensive and homogenous statistics by type of goods for all modes of transport would provide a useful general framework for supporting and supervising the policy promoting co-modality .
Now it must be ensured that the EGF supports workers who have been made redundant to reintegrate into the labour market , despite the fact that EGF assistance should not replace the measures that are the responsibility of the businesses under national legislation or collective agreements , or measures to restructure businesses or sectors .
Out of these , around 75 % are male and 25 % are over 55 years of age .
Consequently , the rapporteur considers that the control and enforcement scheme adopted by the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission ( NEAFC ) must be swiftly incorporated into EU law .
I voted in favour of the Thomsen report , which tackles the issue of precarious women workers , as I am concerned about women being particularly hit by the consequences of the economic crisis .
We are also surprised that the Council is expressing surprise at some of the tactical cuts being proposed by Parliament , given the significance of the cuts , both in terms of compromise appropriations and in terms of payment appropriations , which the Council itself has introduced .
As we consider them to be of the utmost importance to the Area of Freedom , Security and Justice , we have also proposed re-establishing the appropriations for the three funds aimed at immigration and integration : the European External Borders Fund , the European Return Fund and the European Fund for the Integration of Third Country Nationals .
It is clear that the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament does not believe it is possible to strike that balance and , therefore , it is tabling amendments that would break the budgetary ceilings and make a battle with the Council inevitable .
This is particularly the case as we know that the confidence that
