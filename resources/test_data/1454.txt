for this segregation is not the so-called embargo on the Greek Cypriot side , it is the Turkish occupation , the breakaway action of the occupying regime and the fact that the economy of the occupied areas is inextricably bound up with the Turkish economy , to the point even that the Turkish pound has been introduced as the currency of the occupied areas .
The same happened in the recent opinion of the Council 's legal department , which expressly recognises the right of the Republic of Cyprus to keep the said ports and airports closed .
Our group supports the financial regulation for Turkish Cypriots , provided of course that the Republic of Cyprus is respected and no benefit or political advantage is reaped by the occupying regime .
I would remind the House of the view of COREPER , that the matter would be debated under the next Presidency , under the Luxembourg Presidency .
It has been said that the matter will be resolved depending on where there are appropriations .
I believe that this matter will be resolved before the Court in Luxembourg .
We therefore need to see what can be done , as the Commissioner says .
The money will be wasted .
So why do we not do the same with Turkey ?
If you have the courage to kick out the occupying army – which is the only occupying army in a European country – development will automatically follow .     – Mr President , I should like to start by congratulating Mrs Rothe and , of course , Mr Samuelsen on their reports .
I wish to say , however , as the Council has also taken a stand , that the regulation on financial support is one matter , while the regulation on trade relations is another .
They are our compatriots .
That is our objective .
We must not forget this .
In closing , I should like to point out that the reunification of Cyprus must be the objective of all of us .
I have been fighting on this front for many years , not just recently .
That is why the report by Commissioner Patten is an insult to my intelligence , when it appears that he does not understand where this support will come from ; from heading 3 , which relates to countries in the European Union , or from heading 7 , which relates to candidate countries .
I would even add for our collective credibility as institutions of the European Union .
The planned objective was not achieved , in that European public opinion itself , non-governmental organisations and business and cultural associations ignored the official policy of the European Union and continued to maintain relations and work with Cuban society .
Wherever such a policy has been applied , the people have ultimately paid the price .
Cuba is the only country in Latin America with which the European Union has no such agreement .
The Cuban people cannot suffer double punishment , both from the United States and from the European Union .
It includes all the policies which directly concern citizens : unemployment , poverty , job insecurity , the standard of education , health and social protection .
We must not forget the results of the European elections , which prove that citizens are alienated from the development of the European venture .
The tragic events with Van Gogh and the extremists from the other side illustrate , unfortunately , that terrorism is working and what it is seeking : to ultimately suppress the obvious .
Integration .
Secondly , when we lay down policies for integration , we cannot ignore the fact that we have millions of European citizens in countries the world over who are themselves immigrants .
Thirdly , attention to personal rights when dealing with terrorism .
The first is the situation in Iraq .
Elections in Iraq must be held and as many forces as possible must participate , so that the elections really are not an end in themselves but a means which will allow Iraq to shortly become a progressive democracy .
The second parallel and related issue is the situation in the Middle East .
In other words , certification has been awarded to private individuals by the state , which will check them randomly and , more importantly , in a very small ratio .
The objective is to extend the profitability of private capital which , in addition to production and sales , will also have certification , and to reduce the corresponding public spending by the Member States , which will be passed on to farmers many times over .
The appropriations were not taken up , not because there was disagreement on the orientation of the programme , but because the ruling order of each Member State of the European Union wishes ( for the moment at least ) to retain responsibility for its borders and to decide on the basis of its own interests how many immigrants it is in its interests to squeeze dry .
The Commission , following the Cypriot people 's refusal to accept the partitioning Annan plan , considering Cyprus in practice as a third country , is putting the financing of occupied Cyprus under the European Agency for Reconstruction of the Balkans .
This sort of 'assistance ' is a mockery and an alibi for political spoon-feeding , strengthening big business and imposing capitalist restructuring on the states in the area .
We believe that all foreign interference must stop and the foreign armies must withdraw from the area .     . – I am voting in favour of the reports by Mrs Rothe and Mr Samuelsen because I believe that the Turkish Cypriot community in Cyprus needs economic and development aid with the objective of reuniting the island
