I ask that funds should be seen as being entrusted to our care and that they should not , en route to their recipients , be wasted or siphoned off by fraudsters .
We need to go to the root of the problem if we want to stamp out fraud .
Brussels ought only to be granting subsidies to cross-frontier projects or in cases where each country is too small to be able to carry out the projects concerned on its own .
Prioritising of this kind can be done much better by Danish voters and politicians .
We can safely leave those decisions to Portuguese voters and their representatives .
Funds are more efficiently transferred to poor Member States from the rich countries in the north by reducing or completely doing away with the contributions paid by poor countries to the EU.
At present , EU subsidies mean more often than not that poor people in rich countries are taxed for the benefit of rich people in poor countries .
For example , 20 % of farmers receive 80 % of subsidies .
Our citizens will then ensure that they are done away with .
And then the voters and the various organisations will get involved .
To combat any remaining fraud , it is a splendid idea for the police authorities in the Member States to cooperate with each other .
These things are aimed not at reducing crime but only at creating a new state and developing a more intrusive European Union .
So who is this to be ?
My group proposes that we do not turn the decision into an election battle between left and right .
We ought instead to unite around the best qualified candidate and be content with nominating him or her for the job .
The Commission has positively concealed fraud and so shown the need for an independent director of OLAF .
And because , Madam President , Parliament must clearly abide by the same rules , I too am voting for the agreement .
Mr President , I should also like first of all to express my appreciation of the sterling work which Mr Bourlanges , Mr Virrankoski and Mr Pittella have done as rapporteurs for the budget .
In fact , I also think we have tried to live up to that basic principle when discussing the budget .
It is , on the other hand , a rejection of the way in which the Commission and the Council have proposed financing the reconstruction of Kosovo .
All the more so when , with the signing of the interinstitutional agreement in the spring , it was anticipated that there would be a need to find funds specifically for Kosovo and that the reconstruction would be expensive .
It is important that a solution to this problem is found , and it is my hope that , in the negotiations , the Council will show the required flexibility so that we might find a solution within the framework of the interinstitutional agreement .
We have started with the assumption that EUR 500 million should be found for the reconstruction of Kosovo .
But , in the Committee on Budgets , we have also , through a conference among other things , received information to make us question whether that figure has not been set rather too high for the year 2000 and whether we might not be concerned here with a more long-term commitment .
As a new member , I have been very pleased , during the Committee on Budgets ' negotiations , to experience the discipline which characterises its work .
These tie down the administration and can lead to far too little flexibility and a lack of accountability if we go too far in that direction .
But any tool can become blunt and lose its power if it is not used with care .
I think that in principle , however , it is goals and frameworks we ought to be aiming for to as great an extent as possible .
We need to beware of specifying too much detail .
In this connection , I want vigorously to back up Mr Virrankoski' s proposal that budgets should be prepared and controlled on the basis of activities and in relation to goals , as he has recommended they should be in his report .
Clearly , the circumstances of the past year - what with the Commission ' s departure and the reports by the Committee of Independent Experts - provide a reminder that we need to secure for ourselves a foundation which can give us confidence that resources are being administered in a reasonable way .
This is also the background to why so much money has been placed in reserve .
And the Experts ' report shows that the necessary follow-up and supervision was not in place .
This is the background to the situation in which payments into the technical accounts have been placed in a reserve , and there is a need for open dialogue concerning future administration .
The next few years will demand a lot from us .
Enlargement of the European Union will necessitate a constant re-ordering of our priorities , and we need to continue tidying things up internally .
Mr President , the budget line for reproductive health has been halved by the Council and the Commission .
But , every minute , 380 women become pregnant .
One hundred and eleven women experience pregnancy-related complications and 40 have unsafe abortions .
Approximately 300 million women suffer from short- or long-term illnesses because of complications in pregnancy .
The risk of dying in pregnancy or while giving birth is 1 in 8 in Angola , while it is 1 in 8,700 in a country like Switzerland .
Seventeen per cent give birth completely
