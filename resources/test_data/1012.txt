How is it that Member States are being so reluctant to cooperate in evaluation ?
If additional information is necessary , this is also in the interests of the citizen , who is becoming increasingly involved in the process of monitoring Community law .
When such questions are badly drawn up , the effect can run counter to the aim of legal clarification .
The way in which this report has been adopted is appalling .
This Article stipulates that the Court of Justice may , as it sees fit , impose penalties or fines , sometimes very stiff ones , on a Member State that , for whatever reason , fails to apply Community law .
Account must be taken of the current state of progress in the construction of Europe and of the principle of subsidiarity .
( Parliament rejected the request ) President .
We do not know what matters he is dealing with .
Portugal , quite rightly , focussed the European debate on growth and employment .
The possibilities are apparently endless - communication without frontiers , democratic access to information , trade and communication - but the dream quickly comes up against the realities of the sociological and economic world .
In conclusion , I should like to remind the Commission that personal data protection is an integral part ...
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would first of all like to thank Mr Kuhne and Mrs RÃ¼hle for their reports , especially the well-balanced one from Mr Kuhne .
This clearly demonstrates that the rapporteur must interpret the committee ' s opinion logically .
Mr President , let me first say a few words regarding the quality of the work of our rapporteur Mrs Stauner .
Once again , we must deplore Mrs Stauner ' s method .
The citizens of Europe want more transparency in the operation of the European institutions .
My comments were intended to shed light on the future and to express what the Europe of tomorrow could and should be .
The European Council in Biarritz , two months before the Nice Council , will be an informal summit , chiefly devoted to institutional reform .
The Lisbon European Council in March marked a crucial phase .
Everything possible must be done to make a success of this crucial phase in both practical and human terms .
While respecting Member State authority in the field of education , we must also staunchly support individual exchanges , particularly at university level .
Accordingly , the French Presidency is committed to arriving at a good agreement , as good as possible , next November , at the Hague conference on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change , and will ensure that the Kyoto Protocol is properly implemented .
This legislation must be put into practice and developed .
As you can see , Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the route map that France has set itself for its Presidency of the European Union is both ambitious and very specific .
What we need is , if I might use the English phrase , a 'nice treaty in Nice ' , and I am counting on you .
We welcome the Commission ' s initiative , at the instigation of Mrs Diamantopoulou , and we hope that we shall be able to make progress here , in a manner that is most directly linked with strengthening our economic and monetary power too .
I hope that , under your Presidency , France will once again become a champion for Europe !
We value transparency and working in public on the record , not behind closed doors .
Madam President , Mr President , the French Presidency of the European Union is starting at a time when the debate on the meaning and future of the construction of Europe is continually increasing in scale .
You emphasise that it is our political will that will support the European social model and , indeed , political will is going to prove necessary in order to put a stop to the subordination of social policy to the rationale of the stability pact and the present endeavours of the European Central Bank .
There are times , as you said before the Bundestag , when you have to be able to take the risk and go off the beaten track .
These problems may explain the fact that , abandoning the sterility of the compulsory ritual stipulated by the IGC , some leaders , following the example set by the German Minister for Foreign Affairs , have given in to the urge to go in for a freestyle approach , with the advantages and disadvantages this entails , the latter far outweighing the former , in my opinion .
( The President cut the speaker off since speaking time had expired )
By instigating a simplification of the closer cooperation procedures , you have offered our European partners a two - rather than a three-way directorate .
We cannot agree to this reform granting some states the right and the power to force binding texts on states which are unwilling .
The 'blues ' showed us the way .
It has been announced specifically that the French Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for European Affairs will come to the European Parliament after every ' General Affairs ' Council to inform Parliament and to ensure the necessary dialogue with Parliament .
( Applause ) Quite obviously , this is not France ' s ambition .
I am not absolutely sure that a clear decision can be taken in Nice .
It also , however , presupposes a determination on the part of the candidate countries to undertake the reforms necessary to be able to join the European Union , without which the Union would be disrupted and the states joining without having undertaken the necessary reforms in order to adapt to the Community standards would face major social , economic and political difficulties .
