In the digital field , which I have focused on a great deal here today , we are largely betting on the future , insofar as we promote e-commerce and the transfer of all the products being generated currently in communication technologies , which represent a growing percentage of gross domestic product .
There are , of course , laws and judicial proceedings , but I am very aware of what you have said , and we will therefore act .
That is my opinion .
We revised it in 2004 , and now either we take it seriously or , in 2020 , we will once again be saying that it did not work .
I think that it is an interesting initiative for there to be a High Authority for this issue , and it is true that Copenhagen did not produce the results that we would have wanted .
North Africa , especially Morocco , is of strategic importance to the European Union .
Of course , I would like to confirm to the representative of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance that I agree with many of the suggestions that you made in your speech .
Joining forces does not mean controlling , uniting does not mean leading .
These are the objectives .
Undoubtedly , insofar as we have more energy interconnections and less energy dependency , we will be stronger economically and politically .
We will , at all times , promote the defence of human rights .
My compromise is that each and every one of the specific questions which have been raised by members will get a response at the final sitting that I attend at the end of the six-month period , when Spain 's rotating Presidency will be assessed and judged .
It has been expressly stated that I am in favour of mass immigration and that is categorically not true .
We know that it is difficult to swallow and we know that countries and nations are not measured purely by their political , military or economic power .
Secondly , subsidiarity and languages .
Yes , I have supported him and I do support him , because I have seen him work in favour of a strong and united Europe , and that is very important , over and above ideological positioning .
In support of European unity and a common strategy , we must entrust this task to the European Commission .
We know that peace in the Middle East is a necessary , fundamental condition for peace in other regions , where terror and conflict have spread , driven by radicalism and ideological and religious fanaticism .
Regarding Latin America .
The European interests I uphold in foreign policy action are the interests involving the values of what Europe represents , which has its origins in the Enlightenment and in all the cultural , religious and civic traditions that have flourished and developed in Europe .
It is true that we have a high level of unemployment , as happened during the crises of the 70s and 90s .
( Applause ) Mr President , this is a Council statement on a programme which is an agreement between the European Union and the United States , as you know , for tracking the financing of terrorism and , therefore , with the aim of exchanging and passing on financial data , which I believe everyone agrees upon .
Therefore , the provisional agreement which , as I have said , the Council agreed last year , will in any case will become invalid , unless this European Parliament takes a prior decision , in 2010 .
Furthermore , for the future and with a view to an agreement , not provisional , but definitive , the Commission intends to make recommendations in that regard for the formation of a long-term agreement , not an agreement which finishes in October of next year , such as the one we are talking about , but one for the long term .
This led the Council , during the previous Swedish Presidency , to make a provisional application for a new agreement , to avoid the expiry of the current one on 31 January and , therefore , the cancellation of any possible flow of information .
Therefore , it is valid .
That is the reason it has arrived now .
Parliament will be able to , if it wishes , cut short the validity of this provisional agreement .
Yes , of course , for the moment , we think it is vital to get this provisional agreement in force and , in any case , Parliament will have all the authority accorded it by the Treaty of Lisbon to ultimately decide whether or not the agreement should go ahead .
We are going to inform Parliament on everything it has requested : on the language versions , on which ones are available and so on .
It is as simple as that .
The December summit - an extremely complicated conference characterised by arduous discussions on procedure - was brought to a conclusion in the so-called Copenhagen Accord .
The decision-making rules in place need to be changed so that they can adapt properly to these new times and necessities .
If they prove to be insufficient , we must continue working to further our collective reductions .
We have been pioneers when integrating that principle into our proposals for a fairer and more sustainable development , not only economic , but also social and environmental , knowing that we are strengthening international security in the process .
We have to stand our ground .
Within this scenario , we need further improvements , where new goals and expectations are voiced by very different players and where the rules for the adoption of decisions must be changed to adapt them effectively to new timeframes and needs
