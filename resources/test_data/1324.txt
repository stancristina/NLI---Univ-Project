appropriate for us to propose a directive setting this limit on alcohol levels , but rather we should produce a recommendation to the Member States on this issue .
We believe that subsidiarity and the recommendation will be sufficient for the alcohol level in the various states to be set at 0.5 mg or less than 0.5 mg .
In principle , it largely follows the route of the current conventional line .
The truth is that there is currently no such alternative .
We in the Group of the European People ' s Party consider it necessary to support the main lines set in the Commission ' s proposal , especially with regard to target levels , which coincide with the guidelines of the World Health Organisation on air quality and which establish the permissible concentrations of ozone at 120 µg/m3 .
The more we do to prevent violations of international humanitarian law , the more we remind other states - by means of all the opportunities which our foreign relations offer us - of the need to ratify and respect the Geneva Convention and the more we will be doing to protect these weakest groups .
Lastly , I do not consider it acceptable to say , as the Commission did in its response to my question a couple of months ago , that it does not have the competences nor the resources for actions aimed at promoting international humanitarian law , thereby demonstrating that its approach is basically bureaucratic and that its sensitivities are very different from those expressed by the Council in reply to another question in which I expressed a concern of this type .
A year after waging war against Yugoslavia in the name of human rights , we have remained passive in the face of an even greater violation of these rights on the part of Russia in Chechnya .
This approach to politics , based on pure hypocrisy , is entirely unacceptable to us .
Mr President , at the beginning of his first intervention , Mr Haarder said that Europe did not invent human rights , and that is true .
Just one more example : last Sunday the Basque people received an intimidating invitation not to turn out to vote .
I will therefore present Mr Hernández Mollar ' s intervention .
That was Mr Hernández Mollar ' s intervention .
This must be done whilst respecting their specific religious beliefs and cultural characteristics .
Ernest Renan warned us : " Let us not abandon the principle that man is first and foremost a rational and moral being , before speaking any particular language , before being a member of any particular race , before belonging to any particular culture " .
This Parliament was then consulted again in accordance with the provisions of Amsterdam .
I would like to ask why other foreign nationals have been included and , especially , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , whether the Council has any intention to extend the use of the Eurodac system beyond the application of the Dublin Convention .
I believe that an effort has been made over recent years , but I must insist that it requires special attention now and we must prevent such problems in the future , since it is possible that this problem will become even more acute .
Do you not think that this is rather difficult for the European citizens to understand ?
Now that these negotiations have been concluded and the Council has expressed its view on their content , it falls to Parliament , in response to the Council ' s formal consultation , to give its opinion on the results of the negotiations .
My second point , relating to the content of the negotiations on the implementation of Articles 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 and 12 of the interim agreement , covering trade in goods , public procurement , competition , the consultation mechanism for questions relating to intellectual property and dispute settlement , is to highlight the fact that this package of measures represents a good agreement .
Mr President , Commissioner , the Economic Partnership , Political Coordination and Cooperation Agreement signed with Mexico in December 1997 is back in this House for analysis of the trade measures negotiated in the context of the interim agreement .
In my opinion , the implementation of this agreement will undoubtedly take the European Union and Mexico down a road which offers hope of improving the income levels and quality of life of the communities involved at a time and under circumstances which , despite the distances , evoke the legendary meeting between Suchil and Quetzalcoatl , immortalised in Don Salvador de Madariaga' s " El Corazón de Piedra Verde " .
In the light of this we cannot be optimistic , because the procedure followed in the recent negotiations , without effective control either in this House or in the Mexican Senate , provides ample evidence that the agreement lacks those mechanisms absolutely necessary to ensure that the damage currently being done will not be repeated again in the future .
But politically and geo-politically , the fundamental weight has essentially lain with the United States , its powerful neighbour to the North .
However , many of us feel we cannot realistically and sincerely oppose an agreement like the one before us today , primarily because we believe it will create objective conditions for further development and greater democracy and because , in addition , this agreement includes a suspension clause for non-respect of human rights .
Mr Zedillo promised to let me have full details to prove to me that our concern was groundless .
We have been working against the clock and we have been dealing with an excellent and supportive fellow Member , who has been very open to accepting all the points our committee wanted to raise in this important debate .
