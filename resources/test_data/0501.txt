I think the indications from the Transport Committee have been very clear , namely that we have to make the funds available at least for our shared policy objectives , particularly when it is the environment and safety that are at stake .
For that reason members of the Culture Committee , from whatever political groups they came , demanded above all the restoration of the Commission ’s Budget estimates for town twinning and information policy , in order to gain the public’s acceptance , as also for the youth programmes .
I think more debate on this is called for , and we need to muster the courage to do this .
The Budget itself has become more political .
It does , of course , depend on what is being estimated , and on how much is to be taken up .
The letter of amendment that you have received from the Commission in respect of the 2005 Budget frees up funds in the foreign policy sphere and in the foreign budget , and so we are able to propose that support grants for Croatia be made in future out of Category 7 , as accession negotiations with Croatia are to begin next year .
If , though , we take them seriously , more must in future be made available from the European Budget for such investments in the future as research , education and innovation .
This , I believe , is where we have to ensure that the funds we need to make the policies that we want to happen are actually available .
There will be no blank cheques handed out , neither in the 2005 Budget procedure , nor when it comes to the future funding of the European Union .
Whilst endorsing this approach in principle , we do believe that we absolutely need to fight for specific measures that really make sense .
To move on to the Budget , though , the past five years have seen the administrative apparatus of the European Union expand as never before , something that has to do not only with enlargement , but also with the Council’s inventiveness in extending administration in the shape of the agencies .
I believe that we must – and will – take account of this in the structure of budgets in medium-term financial planning .
I therefore find it entirely incomprehensible that despite the increased number of tasks incumbent upon the enlarged European Union , a fact referred to in many wise speeches by all kinds of government representatives , funding is now to be limited to 1 % of gross domestic product , with the budget at an even lower level .
We are therefore left with only two options ; either we provide the funding earmarked for the agencies without complaint , and cut funding in other priority budget lines in order to find the money to do so ; or we negotiate with the Council in order to increase funding under Heading 3 by the missing EUR 54 million .
During this visit , Commission representatives met representatives from five human rights organisations and from two organisations in the field of forensic medicine , as well as government representatives and representatives from the police , gendarmerie and judicial institutions .
The Financial Perspective put forward by the Prodi Commission , which covers the period until 2013 , does not earmark any funds for a potential accession by Turkey .
Romania still needs to ensure , however , that these measures are implemented successfully .
In any case , I should like to make it clear that , before any possible accession by Romania and Bulgaria , they need to have effective legislation and effective institutions in place to fight corruption .     .
One of the focuses of the PHARE programme for cross-border cooperation between Bulgaria and Greece , which currently receives EUR 20 million in funding annually , has been infrastructure , and in particular the rehabilitation of regional roads with access to the two existing border crossings .
Do you believe it possible that temporary exceptions relating to state aid could be put in place for these border regions in future ?     .
The Commission is still willing to closely consider all the options as to how the process can actually be got moving and can also be better supervised .
It is now largely accepted that the Member States cannot meet these challenges alone .
Your House has already received the proposals that the Commission adopted at the beginning of this month , and I think we have reached a very important point where enlargement is concerned .
I noticed that in this debate , in which , for example , Members spoke about quite different concepts of the European social model , with one Member saying that workers in Europe were over-protected , and others saying that they enjoyed too few social rights .
Our analysis shows clearly that enlargement has brought favourable economic results , not only in the new Member States , but also in the old ones , that both sides are benefiting from our integration of what are growing regions .
Today is for that reason a significant day in the history of the European Parliament .
We have had lively discussions and vigorous disagreements over the last few weeks .
While offering you cooperation , we also urge you to take seriously the advice that the Socialist Group in this House has given you .
As I see it , my friends , competent people have been proposed for the Commission , who do not share my political outlook .
For a long time , we have treated India differently from other countries in the region , China for example , and so we are glad that , to judge by the journeys undertaken recently , both the European Union and many national governments are giving
