text refers to Greek and Filipino sailors , but the title refers only to Greek sailors .
Let me also take this opportunity to follow my fellow-Commissioner Mrs Loyola de Palacio in extending very warm thanks to the budgetary authority , and most especially to Parliament .
Doing that also requires the necessary complement of personnel , not least , of course , where languages are involved , and we have to guarantee that those positions will be filled .
Where , in it , do you want the specific policy priorities to be – in securing borders or combating drugs ?
I think it is also high time that we thought , when it comes to raising funds today , no longer only in terms of the European Investment Bank and its contributions to the organising of growth – valuable though they indeed are – but also to reconsider and examine the possibility of the European Union at last applying an instrument we debated as long ago as 1993 , and inviting subscription to Eurobonds .
We need stability and growth , for on them competitiveness depends , itself the foundation of growth and employment , without which there is no social cohesion .
I see that as interesting , but also regrettable , for this makes it quite plain how the high-flown utterances of Heads of State or Government contrast with the austerity of their actions .
The grave economic downturn in many Member States demands more effective action .
I absolutely fail to grasp how , in view of this economic state of affairs , Members of this House can manage to come up with two recommendations for us , one being that we should deal with the crisis by leaving more muck in the air , which is what Mr Langen’s proposal in part amounts to ; the other , that we carry on stubbornly wrecking the economy with austerity measures , rather than giving it the kick-start that it needs .
I will repeat that for your benefit , Mr President-in-Office : your statement was inadequate .
Their Eminences of the Council want to be the only ones to dole out largesse and to make promises ; none of the glory must rub off on anyone else , certainly not on Parliament .
Are our questions so unimportant that he is unwilling to give us an answer ?     –Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there are so many conflicts and trouble spots in the world at present – let us appeal to common sense and act instead to preserve life .
The exceptional feature of the budget year 2005 is that it will be the first full budgetary year for the European Union of 25 Member States , the first full year of activity for the newly-elected European Parliament , the newly-appointed Commission , and the first full year of implementation of the new Staff Regulations .
Moving on to Council ( Section II ) , the Council is asked to consider presenting its estimates with the Preliminary Draft Budget instead of its first reading to increase transparency .
If we see the White Paper as being about open coordination and mainstreaming , then the Commission ’s communication on the follow-up is more about participation and information .
As you rightly pointed out though , Commissioner , there is a large gap between the theory that we have before us and the practice in European schools .
These issues are , of course , mutually dependent .
A two-track strategy does not of course mean that we refrain from criticism – on the contrary ; it is when strategic relationships are being developed that there has to be a central role for engagement with our canon of values , for the upholding of democracy , of the standards associated with the rule of law , and of human rights .
We also have to make it clear , though , that the Baltic States’ negotiation of accession to the European Union has helped to put minorities there in a position not shared by minorities in many other parts of the world and perhaps not in certain parts of Russia .
With presidential elections now in the offing , I deliberately do not now want to discuss Russia’s internal politics – reference has already been made to ‘managed democracy ’ – even though they must inevitably have an effect on relations between Russia and the EU.
It is so , quite simply , because we depend on them and they on us .
It is our humanitarian and democratic interests , and also our energy strategy considerations , that mean that there is no alternative to a more in-depth strategy for the South Caucasus .
I would ask that we should debate the report tomorrow but defer the vote to April , by which time we will have been able to discuss matters with the Council .
Much of the knowledge gained from the first stage of Daphne was incorporated into the new programme .
Although Mrs Karamanou pointed out earlier that we are this year celebrating 20 years of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities , it must also be stressed that here , in this House too , women labour under a double burden .
The chief end of any individual’s life – the highest goal that he or she can have – is to determine the course of their life freely and in their own way .

In developing countries , complications arising from pregnancy and birth are the main cause of death and disablement for women of child-bearing age .
