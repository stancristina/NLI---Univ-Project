must translate this now into legislation such as is before us today .
We all know that the Portuguese Presidency is determined to bring this debate in the Council to a successful conclusion .
This is why we are very much in favour of extending the directive to groups of people who are discriminated against and also to areas such as housing , education , public service operations and attitudes within the police force .
Surely it should be clear to everybody that it is impossible for a migrant who is discriminated against to prove that he is being discriminated against at work or by house owners , unless the defendant too is at least asked to prove that the facts brought by the plaintiff are unfounded .
The enactment of the general act on equal treatment cost the Netherlands blood , sweat and tears at the time .
It would be beneficial if organisations or other legal entities which intend to fight discrimination were to have the right to initiate the procedure to promote the observation or application of this directive or to support victims in the procedure .
In order to actually tackle discrimination head on , it is extremely important - if not imperative - that this shared burden of proof enter into force .
I can also see why we are discussing this document expeditiously now and why , hopefully we shall be adopting it later today .
Existing European legislation governing the equal treatment of men and women only pertains to the sphere of work and is still lacking in many other areas which , especially if we compare it to the directive which we are discussing today with regard to racial discrimination , need attention as a matter of urgency .
We Europeans even leave the initiative to the Americans who send Jesse Jackson and let him loose in Freetown like a bull in a china shop .
This agreement not only lets the leader of one of the world ' s cruellest terrorist movements off the hook but , to cap it all , also rewards him with the vice-presidency and authority over the diamond mines .
In any event , the arms embargo must be supervised more effectively and perpetrators must be brought to justice .
Incidentally , the followers of the revolution leader , Khamenei , attempted to systematically silence the independent and critical press by issuing publication bans .
Mr President , it is an awkward situation , this tenth anniversary of the elections of the NLD in Burma .
It may be opportune to consider whether we can take so-called intelligent sanctions against Burma .
Since then , Burma has been the scene of unprecedented repression .
We advocate economic isolation and an absolute investment ban by all EU Member States , as proposed several times already by the United States .
Mr President , hooliganism is not a borderline phenomenon but clearly takes the form of a subculture and is , as such , difficult to control .
Mr President , we are unable to support the submitted resolution .
It will be different at Euro 2000 , as this will be a football party for everyone .
If everyone has to fight for a job , a place in education or house , a battle of interests will ensue .
The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left has opted in favour of maximum reinforcement of the position of the victims of discrimination and against all attempts to prejudice this protection .
After all , as long as the demand for prostitutes is still there , there will always be women who , enticed by better prospects presented to them , will - often unwittingly - make themselves available as merchandise .
But I think we need to ask ourselves whether , after four years of work , Europe is sufficiently equipped to be able to fight this trafficking in women effectively .
Thirdly , I think it is clear that without such a legal framework , we will never reach a solution to this problem .
Everyone fears having to pay premiums that are too high and that the small print in insurance policies means that when problems arise , one has far less right to a pay-out than one had anticipated on taking out the insurance .
This begs the question as to whether consumers would benefit far more from democratically controlled , regional institutions than from bureaucratic competition .
Madam President , the final draft agenda is based on a part-session starting on Tuesday 13 June .
An exception could possibly be made for those who can demonstrate that they were required to leave on Sunday on account of the remoteness of their homes , if , for example , they live in Finland or Greece .
This is why I would like to call on the MEPs to continue caring about Kosovo and Serbia .
I believe that smokers are ill-informed on the effects of using tobacco and that they do not give their environment sufficient consideration .
Then , we would have discussed points of sale , smoking at work , smoking in public places , possibly minimum age , which I personally do not support in any case .
I would have liked to propose a list of this kind myself , but I believe that , at the moment , there is too much uncertainty surrounding such a list , to warrant such a proposal .
But indicating the different tar , nicotine and probably carbon monoxide yields also creates a false illusion - and young women , in particular , fall into the trap that certain cigarettes are less harmful than others .
I suggested 35 % or 45 % in a proposal which I re-submitted via my group .
Moreover , the legal offices of the European Parliament and the European Commission have confirmed the correctness of the legal basis .
