What has been happening for decades in Northern Ireland is not exactly the same as what is happening in Kosovo , though there are important similarities .
Mr van den Broek presented us with a different ranking , and that is important : the five central and eastern European countries , certain other central and eastern European countries , and then a grey area which , in one and the same group , included the Republic of Cyprus which is in the first area , Turkey which was not considered eligible in Luxembourg , and Malta , which has declined to embark on the procedure for accession to the European Union .
Mr President , I asked to be allowed a question as soon as the Commissioner began , and you are now telling me that the debate is nearly over .
I repeatedly asked the gentleman who was sitting next to you , and he told me not to worry , because I was on the list .
Mr President , first of all I should like to congratulate the Commission and the DG concerned , because they took the first steps and understood the need to draw together and unify cultural measures which have hitherto been fragmented and were not guided by a common rationale and a single policy in the field of culture .
All too often we restrict our attentions to the democratic or social deficit , but unfortunately we also face a cultural deficit because if , indeed , the construction of a united Europe with a multicultural dimension , with peoples and intellectual and artistic potentials that derive from different sources , different histories , different languages and ways of life , if the effort to build that is a historic one , it must be accompanied by a major cultural efflorescence and explosion .
I think it is very important that the sum set aside to support this programme should be increased to ECU 250 million .
On the contrary , we agree completely .
It should be realised that the Committee on Budgetary Control addresses such issues because there are special reports by the Court of Auditors and these are becoming more numerous .
The general conclusion from this whole affair , Commissioner , is that there will have to be a structural change in the internal organisation of the Commission , a thing which all these phenomena show to be more necessary than might appear at first sight .
Such people must of course be protected , but we must not forget that declarations alone do not suffice for their protection .
In other words , the human body and mind have become a commodity .
Most of the amendments the European Parliament will be voting on go some way towards strengthening the Commission 's text in relation to the safeguarding , if I can use this expression , of the human experimental animals used in clinical trials , with detailed provisions ranging from full information for participants about the clinical trial and their written consent , to restoration and compensation in the event of damage or death .
Finally , Mr President , it is self-evident that the provisions of this directive must be implemented in a uniform manner in all the Member States if we really want to ensure proper clinical trials and fair competition in the production and marketing of drugs .
Unfortunately , however , this fine report addresses appeals and wishes both to the Council of Ministers and to the Commission , and the question , Mr van Velzen , is whether the Council and the Commission have ears to hear what you are saying .
I would remind you that both in the 1998 budget and in the budget for 1999 we will be voting on in a month 's time , expenditure to combat unemployment for social Europe , for people with special needs and for the third age is either static or even lower , and all this at a time when , as you say in your report , full-time jobs are continually becoming fewer and only part-time jobs are being created .
Consequently , incomes are down in a Europe in which costs are going up , and that is why the proportion of nouveaux pauvres has climbed above 15 % .
Mr President , current rates of development are not absorbing the high level of unemployment .
To be honest , how much optimism do these facts justify ?
Mr President , working people disapprove of this policy .
Mr President , it may well be that globally in the European Union there is a downturn in unemployment , though I do not know if it can be said that someone whose temperature has fallen from 41ยบ to 40.5ยบ can be said to be getting better .
I do not know what its results were , perhaps there were some , but nothing came of all our discussions here and from the mobilisation in the European Parliament and in general .
Mr President , though Europe 's economy has in recent years been developing at relatively satisfactory rates - for example , in 1997 growth amounted to 2.7 % - we are not seeing a corresponding fall in unemployment .
Given that the problem of unemployment is a pan-European phenomenon , there must certainly be coordination between the policies of Member States to address the issue globally and effectively .
We do not have to ape the American or Japanese models , but let us look to see why they have lower unemployment and try to learn some lessons , just as we can learn something from some countries in the European Union where unemployment is already exceptionally low .
However , the proposals could certainly have been more daring .
In addition , preparatory work should begin straight away on action programmes against social discrimination and to
