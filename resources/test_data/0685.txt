Finally , I believe that there should be specific and definite rules for imported products , since the rules for these products should be the same as those applied to European products .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the forces opposing REACH demonstrate a sheer obstinacy that can be defined as anti-European .
This being so , we must emphasis the impact that this new regulation will have on small and medium-sized enterprises in the Member States , which more than most other concerns will be overburdened with the new administrative and bureaucratic costs arising from it .
That is why I am against the exemption for products intended for third countries .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to make just three very quick points .
I challenge anyone to contradict my assessment on this point .
As I emphasised in my written question of 26 October 2005 , discrimination continues in Croatia against Italian citizens in access to the property market – access that is guaranteed to other Union states .
Just the prospect of opening negotiations has very often accelerated the transition of the Eastern European countries from totalitarian regimes to committed and prosperous democratic governments , as well as having inspired delicate and difficult reforms in Turkey .
The problem that has been brought to our attention is that of the nuclear power plant at Bohunice in Slovakia and the concomitant problem of the use of financial resources for the decommissioning of nuclear power plants .
Given that most of these reactors are situated in new Member States , and are therefore less sound both structurally and financially , the first problem that the Commission must confront is putting in place a systematic plan for helping and supporting such countries with their decommissioning .
The next step , still under the aegis of the international community , should be for all the Arab states in the region to become increasingly involved in the whole process of democratisation and the fight against terrorism .
Nevertheless , we have to do even more for the Iraqi people , in conjunction , of course , with the United Nations , which , through Resolution 1546 , has enabled 35 countries to make a significant contribution to the birth of that new democracy .
Let us finally take a close look at the real situation .
Therefore , I too strongly call for a UN investigation into the use of banned white phosphorus bombs by the American forces .
I think we can achieve a figure of one tonne-of-oil equivalent per person .
Such a commitment should encourage us to save energy and to use alternative , renewable , democratically managed sources .
Therefore , in view of everything I have just said , I voted against the report .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , to paraphrase your introductory words , Mr Straw , I am here and I beg to differ .
It is a privilege that has been paid for mainly by Italy and France , siphoning off precious resources from our two countries .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I have the impression that the Heads of State or Government meeting at Hampton Court were debating in a vacuum .
Instead we need to address the causes , change our policy and stop making insane decisions , such as making it easy for people to bring in their families or even easier to take up nationality .
A meagre budget will not allow us to address these challenges , but the October European Council was an encouraging start .
I should like to mention an example that I put to President Barroso yesterday evening .
I refer to the positive outcome of the Turkish question , which would not have been possible without a strong commitment from the UK Presidency , and to its ability to give direction , vision and some clear objectives that were subsequently put into practice , at least potentially , at Hampton Court , namely universities , energy , security and defence policy .
The truth is that fortunately , within days , we heard the statements by the former leader Mr Khatami , which ran in a completely different direction .
Israel and Palestine are linked by a single destiny and wiping out Israel would mean wiping out Palestine .
The unilateral nuclear rearming of Iran must be stopped in line with our resolution of 13 October 2005 and the conclusions of the General Affairs Council of 7 November .
It has already enabled us to improve the code , making it a dynamic instrument that can adapt from time to time to the problems and changes associated with the arms export trade in the European Union .
The report calls for sanctions to be applied to countries that do not comply with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 .
We call for a more forceful strategy , involving all EU Member States , that severely sanctions activities that contribute to proliferation and reinforces the ban on chemical and biological weapons .
It seemed almost impossible to speak in this fine Chamber during the debate on the highly important REACH provision .
I fully support the request to provide this strategy with adequate instruments and resources together with precise deadlines in order to be able to assess its progress .
What is more , all too often these goods are counterfeit , and so give rise to a huge market financing criminal organisations , in addition to directly damaging European companies and undermining their long tradition of professionalism .
Our businesses do not seek privileges or the enjoyment of special positions : all they ask is to be able to compete in the international market on an equal footing , with joint respect for the rules .
When the European Community agreed the Fischler reform of the common agricultural policy , however , our farmers were told that the
