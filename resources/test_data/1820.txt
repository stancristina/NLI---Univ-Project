strategy for promoting economic activity .
As all those present are well aware , this is not easy - we have a tremendous amount of work to do in this respect ourselves - but we can raise the issue that the role of women needs to be reassessed when it comes to questions of war and peace , for example .
Five years ago , at the Beijing Conference , it was stated that women ' s rights are human rights .
We quite agree with the rapporteur , Mrs Smet .
We do not , however , want this issue to be used against us for political purposes .
I should like Parliament ' s administration to take immediate steps to put an end to this occupation , so that Members can have the use of both ends of their coffee bar .
I wish to mention one or two problems connected with this issue .
Competition alone does not guarantee it .
In general , I support the notion that technical systems are not neutral .
At least it is a social question , if not a party political one , because , for example , Gallup polls and voting in local elections will depend on interactive facilities , as will the extent to which people can intelligently participate .
The MHP , or future Multimedia Home Platform , which transfers facilities from the apparatus to software , is , in a way , the final revolution in this chain , making it possible - as the rapporteur remarked - to receive everything off the television on the Internet , obviously including papers and magazines , films and everything else , perhaps even fragrances , which , for us older men , would be a real pick-me-up .
These are manufactured by companies whose methods and staff have encroached on each other ' s territories , and this causes the confusion , although there is also new business , which is the issue here .
The large converged monopolies are becoming a problem for us Europeans since they often make mutual agreements on regulations to control the market and thus stifle free competition , i .e . as we deregulate here , they re-regulate : they make new regulations , and this balance - as I understood Mr van Velzen to say - is very important .
Then there is the universal service , about which my learned colleague , Mr Harbour , spoke .
Perhaps there is no need to define it , but it should be returned to , as this concept is constantly evolving .
It may involve , for example , hospital services , consultation services , and other important services of this type .
They are causing Europe to lag behind America , and this to me is a serious issue , this process that works against an eEurope .
We now have before us a large package of reforms which it is vitally important that we adopt and implement swiftly in order to further the process of freeing up markets .
Parliament has reservations about licence auctions for third generation wireless communications .
I am also worried , for my own part , about how licence fees will affect the development of markets .
Only time will show what the most rational solution will be .
I support the 'soft law ' approach in the creation of the new operational environment , in a way , however , that the legislator is given ample opportunity to make his or her position known to the Commission and the Council , before recommendations are made concerning the matter or other decisions taken revising the operational environment .
I would still like to stress that competition should be promoted openly and transparently , to a degree that is adequate , and not through price policy regulation .
Commissioner , you said in your answer to Mr FÃ¤rm that the Member States have a great responsibility in the implementation process with regard to eEurope .
The only problem they have , however , is not financing and its rechannelling , but the fact that national authorities as well need to be altogether more active in the implementation of the eEurope initiative .
Now , however , the telecommunications regulatory bodies in the British Isles , at least , have had huge problems establishing competition in local networks , although last Thursday we received a slightly more positive message from them .
Madam President , Commissioner , representatives of the Council , it is often said that Parliament is far removed from the people and that what we speak about here does not interest the people in our home countries .
I quite agree with what Mrs Lulling said , that the alcohol problem cannot be resolved by restricting imports , nor can it be resolved by keeping prices high and the sale of alcohol in the hands of a monopoly .
As a counterbalance to the opening up to EU imports , Finland , however , is asking for the right to reduce quotas on beer imported from non-member countries .
This restriction that is being sought is , in itself , justifiable , as long as the restriction is not a permanent one .
The restrictions with regard to non-member countries should be lifted by the end of 2003 , as the faster Finland is obligated to open up her market entirely , the more likely we will be able to see a real solution to the question of excise duty .
Opening up the market in respect of non-member countries more rapidly than scheduled , however , will increase pressure to lower taxes , and the faster taxation reaches a European average , the healthier the situation in the internal market will be .
The derogation has been restricted in terms of time , and I thus support the Commission ' s line here .
