The fundamental criticism of the Schengen system continues to be highly valid when it comes , for example , to personal privacy and the ability of refugees to claim asylum .
The continued construction of ' Fortress Europe ' must cease as soon as possible .
However , we do not want a permanent EU-financed border control force .
As regards paragraph 18 on a review of the basic principle of the Dublin II Regulation , we think that a discussion of the principle is justified but that it should be conducted in a wider context and as part of a discussion of the common immigration and refugee policy as a whole .
Integrating aviation into the EU 's emissions trading scheme is an obvious and cost-effective step in the climate work .
It is unacceptable that the Commission has allowed itself to be influenced by international political pressure aimed at delaying the climate work and distorting competition .
Anything else would be unreasonable .
With all due respect for the subject matter , we would like to point out that this is a report the European Union could have done without .
Within the current EU cooperation framework it is established that the Member States have exclusive responsibility for the organisation of education .
We cannot accept any restrictions on transparency , which is something the report in effect entails .
We share the view that physical education is important and that voluntary work is an important part of the sports movement in Europe .
We would like to emphasise , however , that we share the view of the report that sport is important for several reasons .
I am therefore abstaining in the final vote .
Few question the importance of children receiving physical education at school .
The problem with the report , not least with regard to the paragraphs voted on individually , is that Mr Schmitt goes a very long way .
There is no doubt that the aim of the report is good .
However , we consider it regrettable that a majority in Parliament advocate both high emission ceilings and an insignificant amount of auctioning of emission allowances .
I congratulate the new Schengen members for having succeeded in the feat of satisfying the requirements of the Schengen rules in such a short space of time .
We have heard here what an historic step forward this is .
As we have heard , we need SIS II in order to strengthen security within the new enlarged area .
Finally , I would like to recall that many of the new Member States have long historical ties to their European neighbours .
We have chosen to vote in favour of the report even though a number of EU countries already have fully functioning legislation in the area of soil protection .
There is no need for a framework directive on soil protection .
The proposal will only lead to increased bureaucracy and more complicated rules for the parties involved .
We have chosen to vote in favour of the proposal in its entirety .
It is important that international standards are introduced and respected in order to protect the financial system against crime and money laundering in general , while at the same time the Member States ' own measures must not be incompatible with the rules of the single market .
The large sums go to other kinds of well-organised crime .
Civil servants should , without risk of reprisal , be able to provide information , obtain information in order to exercise their freedom of expression and freedom to disclose information , have the right to anonymity and an investigation ban which means that authorities and other public bodies are not allowed to investigate who has provided information under the freedom to disclose information .
A big responsibility rests here with the Portuguese Presidency .
Not only in fine words , but they need money , methodological development and access to new technology .
But it is also a catastrophe for the people who live in these areas when their livelihoods disappear .
What we need is a growing forest where the final product is taken care of in a way that locks in the CO2 and other greenhouse gases .
We know that 25 states emit 83 % of the gases we need to stop and , Commissioner , Minister , a true friend is a person who asks how you are doing and also stops to listen to the answer .
It also shows that problem gambling , alcohol consumption , drugs and smoking increase social exclusion .
In addition , we subsidise wine producers and tobacco growing .
It is possible to change the social reality but , in order to do so , public health concerns and environmental concerns must be given more importance than the competition rules of the single market , and social welfare and security must be given more importance than deregulation and privatisation .
If there are deficiencies in one country , Sweden has no way of checking the border protection .
The investigations made show that there are problems which need to be tackled , and the reasonable thing would be to delay joining until all the requirements have been satisfied .
Bluefin tuna has been an endangered species for a long time following massive overfishing .
We also supported Amendment 13 which would have meant that we should adopt a recovery plan worthy of the name .
We are firmly opposed to this but we are also opposed to the European Parliament , through this resolution , making yet another attempt to have the EU take over the independent foreign policies of the Member States .
In the resolution in question , the EU aims to gather the Member States under a common flag in order to steer the conference negotiations in what the EU considers to be the right
