Administratively , many stumbling blocks could be removed .

They only want to vote if the body they need to choose has a decisive say and if there is an actual choice between conflicting alternatives .
The protection against pollution , nuisance and dangers in their living environment that most people want often means that businesses are hindered in their pursuit of profits .
Attention is now once more being paid to finding the money to help the victims of flooding .
This has mainly resulted in death and destruction .
In the light of this improvement , I am voting in favour of the resolution .
The existence of two Germanies , two Vietnams and two Yemens ultimately came to an end because one was able to swallow up the other .
In 1999 there were good grounds for suspecting that the war was not only about Kosovo .
The intensification of economic cooperation cannot be seen as a separate issue from progress in the areas of human rights and democracy .
The accusations of fraud with EU money are not only unsubstantiated , according to the Commission , they are completely unfounded .
The political climate is often so influenced by Islam that politicians only have a chance in elections if they support this legislation .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , President Mugabe 's dictatorship is reprehensible .
We cannot interfere in the internal affairs of a sovereign country .
Just listen to this : ' The game we are going to play needs music , ' the Zimbabwean police agent told the 12-year-old girl at 10 o'clock at night .
Quite the opposite .
It is not he who has driven his own people to starvation , but the neo-liberal development model .
The President was allowed to unashamedly propound misleading political propaganda at the Johannesburg Summit .
In an administrative note dated 29 July 2002 the Commission reports that since 1998 there have been 49 - not 50 - disciplinary cases .
Recently , I received a complaint from Dutch citizens in Bellingwolde , a village situated on the Dutch-German border .
The complaint was about the windmills which the German Government had installed very near the border , allowing green electricity to flow into Germany , while the Dutch village is landed with the pollution .
Mr President , we urge you to broach this subject with the Commission as a matter of urgency .
All manner of conceptions have come into being of what a 'refugee ' actually is , and the Member States have developed secondary forms of protection .
That strikes me as a futile exercise .
Moreover , it would not solve anything .
This should be accompanied by justice , which is not always easy , because it means justice not only in the form of access to the legal system , but also in the form of refusal and deportation .
I am pleased that this regulation provides a modern version of obsolete legislation on offal .
I should like to finish off with a comment on kitchen and restaurant waste that contains animal products , on which we have reached a respectable compromise .
Do we , however , assume that it is sound as it stands , or would we like to use this opportunity to make an exception and be more rigorous than the Protocol ?
We have no intention of re-entering the debate , as it has already been held , but my group will definitely be endorsing Amendments Nos 51 and 50 .
Mr President , I have already indicated in previous debates that it is essential that GMOs be exported to third countries in a responsible manner .
Moreover , I can imagine that those countries too set great store by freedom of choice , a value so cherished in Europe .
The present text helps the Member States to make every effort to prevent unintentional transboundary movement of GMOs .

I have no problems with sending out this message within the European Union , but we must refrain from applying it in the context of the Biosafety Protocol , which is about safety .

If this policy is already controversial , and European agricultural policy is controversial , then we must in any event ensure that the money is well spent .
How much is it in the cereal sector , or the tobacco sector ?
This is the essence .
As is generally known , we take the view that this should be Article 280 because it is essentially about the good management of EU funding .
Why ?
Mr Mulder constantly hides behind this argument .
He has done this for the past couple of years , and this is not the way forward , certainly not given the fact that the agricultural budget accounts for half of the European budget .
This proves that this policy has got out of hand and that we must inject transparency into the flow of funding .
When Mr Casaca then tries - at least based on the authority which we clearly have , which is a budgetary authority - to gain an overview of the whole subsidy scheme , we do not exactly receive satisfactory feedback from you .
There are innumerable examples quoted here .
I should therefore like to concur with our fellow MEPs in their plea .
( NL ) Authoritarian governments have always been characterised by the notion that they can best survive criticism on their policy by restricting their citizens in their freedom of information exchange , opinion , organisation and travel .
The upshot is that , even more than before , families
