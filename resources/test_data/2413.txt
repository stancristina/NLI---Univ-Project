on renewable energy sources which is at the present time being prepared by the Commission and on the basis of which the development of a European industry will be encouraged , with fundamental opportunities for the export of know-how and investment to third countries , chiefly in central and eastern Europe , but also to Southern Mediterranean countries .
Secondly , local employment pacts in the shape of associations between local authorities , private individuals and trade unions , which the report claims will remove regulatory , economic and institutional barriers , have already proved to be , not a driving force for employment , but a particularly effective vehicle for destroying the basic rights achieved by the working class , since most local pacts are not binding under either collective agreements or other labour regulations .
Thirdly , I want to talk about the strong influence the voice of the European Union should be having on the future of social protection .
Our voice must be raised in protest at the crime that is being committed against the weakest groups in society .
Mr President , if I have understood what was said correctly , in Kyoto we will have a realistic objective , but the problem is whether or not we have partners - and indeed serious and reliable partners - who are in sympathy with this objective and the policies that go with it .
If these means do not exist , I would at least like to ask you if you are prepared to launch a large-scale campaign to inform and motivate the public regarding the seriousness of the issue , the proposals that have been put forward and the ways that exist to solve the problem , so that , at least at the level of propaganda , we can challenge the propaganda of the Unites States and other countries , which is being used to downgrade the issue and to ridicule efforts to change policy .
First of all , this Parliament has judged the Customs Union with Turkey on the basis of promises that Turkey will comply with certain basic preconditions concerning issues of human rights , democracy , state of law , and cohabitation in accordance with international regulations as regards the Kurds , the Cypriots and Greek-Turkish relations .
It has , I see , been deferred until the next part-session .
( The President cut off the speaker )
First , there is no doubt that the European Parliament , with its resolution of the 19 February 1997 , has succeeded in consolidating its position and today is able to exercise real control over the actions of the European Commission .
Fifth , it is not possible to use slaughtered animals that are unfit for human consumption in the production of cattle feed .
Ninth , the Commission has of course complied with many of the recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry but not always in the same satisfactory way .
This disease is extremely serious , it has tragic consequences for the families of the victims and of course we do not yet know the total number of deaths the disease will cause , given the fact that there are people in whom the disease has not yet manifested itself .
The Council has , in a very elegant way , disclaimed any responsibility and has loaded all the responsibilities onto you .
You have told us that you have found no evidence against your staff and so you have not punished them .
However , I would like you to tell me in your reply whether this illegal trade is continuing not only to thirdworld countries - although it makes very little difference , people live there too - but also to countries of the European Union .
Mr President , I would like to take my turn in thanking Mr Böge and Mrs Roth-Behrendt for the work that they have done , enabling us , within nine months , to arrive at a point where we are now debating this issue in this pleasant atmosphere .
I think that a little more courage is needed as we must make up lost ground .
I believe that , if we wish to be honest with the consumer , we must tell the truth today .
If they learn their lesson , the unfortunate thing is that the lesson will be learnt not only by the Member States , but much more harshly , I am afraid , by the producers .
This report of the Community Commission was given an almost unanimous vote in this committee .
Quite by chance rather than by good fortune .
Yet I believe that this meeting may , and please forgive my pomposity , be of historic importance .
Mr President , first of all I would like to express my congratulations to Mrs Karin Jöns for her report , which quite accurately exposes the problems caused directly or indirectly by the Agreement that was signed by the bodies of the European organizations of employers and employees and which , unfortunately , lags far behind the settlements which have been elaborated by the International Work Organization or which are already being implemented in certain Member States .
Working people are being called upon , through this virulent and unjust treatment and through the widespread increase in poverty , to shoulder the burden of strengthening the competitiveness of European capital .
As a result it is necessary to promote measures for the defence of those who nevertheless will work under part-time or atypical work agreements .
Cohesion may strengthen competitiveness while competitiveness may in turn contribute to the promotion of convergence , growth and employment
