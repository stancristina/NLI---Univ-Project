Let us agree to start with what we have before us , discuss matters and reach an agreement as soon as possible .
This article is cumbersome and calls for unanimity in the Council .
Secondly , the Statute must be adopted during this parliamentary term .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I have followed this afternoon 's debate in the House with great interest .
What we are certainly opposed to is any solution involving a review of the European Communities ' protocol on privileges and immunities .
I do however want to say that as a Commissioner and in previous years as a Member of this House , I have always valued the power of his arguments and the strength of his convictions , whether or not I have agreed with them .
Perhaps the most striking aspect of the report is the issue of promotions , particularly since it talks about 490 promotions when in recent years there have been an average of 150 .
I shall refer to three amendments .
According to the majority of Member States ' legislation , there can be no contract without deeds and registration .
We therefore need to urgently adapt our Community policies to these changes , particularly those changes that affect marketing methods .
As a result , we would be doing the consumer a disservice if , through a sectoral directive , we began to disrupt the balance of the highly complex relations between Community law and the Member States ' law , and the principle of subsidiarity has been mentioned in this respect .
In short , Mr President , Community law must be respected .
First , they offer the institutions the opportunity to conclude any legislative codecision procedure at first reading , as provided for in the Treaty , provided they have reached an agreement , as is only logical .
I think we should be pleased in this respect because democracy has , in fact , been strengthened as a result .
Furthermore , in practice we can see that the clause that provided the Council with a last attempt to overcome the European Parliament 's opposition has never been seriously used .
So the future Parliament is faced with a legislative task that entails greater responsibility .
I must admit that I completely forgot about this formal sitting .
Undoubtedly , there were ups and downs , but I will not go into them here .
The public are aware that this is a Parliament of truth .
We must thank Mr Santer for accepting Parliament 's role .
The German Presidency has done a great deal of work since it took over .
If it is not resolved , enlargement will be impossible .
We are in the best position to help .
Parliament 's services have informed us that this joint debate on Agenda 2000 will begin with statements by the Council and the Commission , which will then be followed first by the speeches by the groups rather than the speeches by the rapporteurs .
We have had the novel experience of negotiating with the Council and the Commission in order to find a consensus between Parliament 's position , that of the 15 Member States and the Commission 's proposal .
The aim here is to promote exchanges between Europe 's peripheral areas and the Community 's central regions .
In my speech to the House at first reading , I called on the Commission to amend its proposal and put fisheries on an equal footing with agriculture .
I would even go so far as to say that , in handling these proposed reforms , the European Commission - which is the driving force for action in the European Union - has given the impression that it was not very sure where it was heading .
Firstly , coming from the lips of the very author of the reform , it highlights the fact that the current measures will not be effective enough , and this is even before we apply them .
We have been thinking about and working on this for a long time : the Committee on Budgets spent many hours debating , 22 working documents were discussed and a resolution was drawn up , which was approved by the House a few months ago .
Therefore , faced with the challenges of the launch of the euro , enlargement to include the CEECs , and the essential reforms of the CAP and the structural policies , I recommended at the time that we should try to conclude a new interinstitutional agreement , even if it was against a backdrop of even greater austerity , if possible .
Agricultural spending was frozen , the structural policy was cut by 20 % , and internal policies were cut by 54 % , if we exclude the framework programme for research .
Moreover , part of the CAP expenditure is being transferred to non-compulsory expenditure .
In my opinion , each of our governments went to Berlin to see what was in it for them , and very few , if any , looked to see what was in it for Europe .
Between the 1.27 % - which we criticised in December 1997 - and the 0.97 % agreed in Berlin , there was enough room for manoeuvre to reach an agreement which would have been rigorous yet better for Europe .
But now the applicant countries from Central and Eastern Europe are being offered a pittance and told that , if they join , they will be treated with kid gloves .
Then , because of its resignation , it said that it was not going to do so until the autumn .
The financial allocations for continental production are being increased again , while those for Mediterranean production remain frozen .
In the wake of the Commission 's timid proposal ,
