challenges for an evolving constitutional state , which we will be monitoring very carefully .
It is nevertheless very important that there should be a good deal of two-way communication within the framework of this strategic partnership .
Moreover , political dialogue , which is engaged in with Russia on a regular basis , provides an opportunity to discuss and raise these problems in the area of human rights .     .
With the communication and political dialogue that accompanies this , and which exist at present , we can remind Russia of these human rights challenges , and that is what we do .
These matters obviously need to be gone over now , while we are preparing for the renewal of the Partnership and Co-operation Agreement and the establishment of a mandate to renew it .
The Council , for its part , reached political consensus on the Seventh Framework Programme for research on 24 July 2006 , and this consensus is responsible for the outcome of the vote by the European Parliament .
I would refer at this point to document number 11978/06 , which mentions the political consensus reached on the Seventh Framework Programme .
The result of this will presumably make it possible to adopt the Seventh Framework Programme before the end of the year .
Mr President , the situation is of course problematic if such things have not been precisely regulated in national legislation , but according to the position adopted by the Council , the main conditions for funding are a precise ethical evaluation of each project proposal and consideration of the legislation in Member States .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Council is not responsible for the protection of EU citizens abroad ; that is up to the Member States .
Let us hope that progress is made in this area .     .
Mr President , the European Union has on many occasions stated that the treatment of prisoners captured on the battlefield must comply with the provisions of the Geneva Convention and the customary rules of international humanitarian law , and must respect human rights .
Mr President , it is important for the Presidency , representing the Council as it does , to keep within the limits of its competence .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Council has been waiting for an outcome on a framework decision , as at least one Member State has had serious reservations about the text in the form that it was in in 2004 .
Mr President , I agree with the honourable Member that the European Union should try and intervene in key challenges , but , obviously , we have to do so step by step , and we cannot respond to all the challenges at the same time .
Mr President , the fact that we are making progress with the framework decision does not mean that it is now problem-free : differences in attitude to freedom of speech , the principle of legality and legal systems in the Member States in this regard still lead to unanswered questions .
On the basis of discussions held so far , we now propose to draft a more focused proposal for a framework decision , about which it nevertheless has to be said that it will hardly have had time to be drawn up before the next presidency is behind the wheel .     .
In its resolution last December on the human rights situation in Iran , one that also had the Union’s support , the UN General Assembly expressed its grave concern over discrimination and other human rights violations , including the systematic discrimination against women and girls in legislation and in practice .
When it met on 15 May , the Council expressed its concern about the increase in the number of executions , random arrests , the tightening of restrictions on access to information , and the increase in violations of freedom of speech and freedom of religion .
The Council is therefore aware of the incidents connected with recent demonstrations .
During the Finnish Presidency , the EU has already made three public statements on the human rights situation in Iran .
On account of the death of the student activist , Akbar Mohammad , at the Evin prison on 24 August , the Presidency said that the EU was seriously concerned about the harsh treatment of dissidents , opposition leaders , student activists and all defenders of human rights in Iranian prisons .
The statement made separate mention of the prominent human rights lawyer Abdolfattah Soltani , who was sentenced to five years in prison .
The Council is still trying to organise a meeting between the EU and Iran within the framework of the human rights dialogue which began in 2002 .
At least as a matter of policy , we have also supported and will continue to support women’s organisations in a way that continues to highlight these human rights issues and the current problems , both in direct contacts and in international forums .
For that reason , the Council cannot comment on the ratification procedure , nor would it be proper for it to do so .     .
Mr President , the mood has not changed , at least in the sense that , much to our satisfaction , the conclusions of the European Council in June , in which the matter of the Union’s absorption capacity was also covered , clearly stated that absorption capacity would not be a new criterion imposed on applicant countries , but something separate which would also have to be taken into account within the European Union .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Council would like to inform the honourable Member that the Counter-terrorism Coordinator drew up a comprehensive report in May 2006 on EU action to combat terrorism , which also covers the area of external relations .
