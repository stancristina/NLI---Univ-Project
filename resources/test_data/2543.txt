the van Hulten report in committee .
We have resubmitted a few amendments which fell in committee , in particular , our desire to see the codes of conduct revised specifically to include the reference to merit and managerial capacity which you , Commissioner , accepted - when we had our hearings last September - should be included in these codes of conduct , particularly when considering appointments and promotion .
Looking to the future , we know that we are at the beginning of a long process of continuing reform in the European Commission .
We want in particular to see the hard-working and highly competent norm for Commission officials acknowledged in the outside world - a reputation that has been darkened by the inappropriate conduct of a few individuals .
Commissioner , you will be aware from your presence in the last Commission why the crisis occurred .
In a nutshell : there were programmes being run for which there were insufficient staff resources available .
We urge you to take the opportunity to establish the real staffing needs of the Commission based on the essential activities for which it is responsible .
Our position was made very clear on this topic in the 2000 budget .
We will be vigilant over the next five years to ensure the reforms now being suggested are fully implemented and will support efforts made to modernise institutions .
But , equally , we will not hesitate to withdraw our support financially or otherwise should steps be taken which do not correspond to the openness promised by Commission President Romano Prodi prior to his nomination .
Let us hope that we can avoid institutional upheavals by having an ongoing dialogue which assumes from the outset that Parliament will be an equal partner in deciding the outcome of Commission reform .
Mr President , I must start by apologising that I cannot be nearly as dramatic as Mr Elles in my presentation .
Can I first thank Mr van Hulten for this report .
It is an excellent report .
It would have been wrong for Parliament to have put in willy nilly every single recommendation that came from an external body because Parliament should have its own opinion on these issues .
It is right for us to have a focused report which is what Mr van Hulten has produced .
Can I invite Mr Elles not to put the cart before the horse .
Yes , a lot of things were lost by the Socialists but they have not been won in plenary yet , and may I warn him that may not be the case tomorrow .
I should like to thank Commissioner Kinnock for all his efforts so far .
He has been clear that his commitment has been to produce a radical change .
Central to this is the attempt to produce and engender responsibility .
It is clear that this needs to be developed at all levels and it needs to recognise the needs of each level within the Commission .
It is clear that we need to see a change in the Financial Regulation .
That is important .
We need to stop people passing the buck from one to another .
Where failure is occurring within the Commission we need to hold people responsible .
We need to be assured that consistent under-performance must lead to dismissal .
This is natural elsewhere but it seems to be an extremely radical suggestion when it is put to the Commission .
We cannot continue with a situation where incompetence , mismanagement and fraud are costing the European taxpayers money and providing them with a poor service .
I will give you one example of this .
In the 1998 Court of Auditors report an exchange rate miscalculation in relation to Italian wine cost the taxpayers of Europe GBP 8 to 10 million .
It is clear that is not acceptable .
What happened to the person who was responsible for that miscalculation ?
We need a system which provides incentives and promotion and we need to see this promotion based on merit .
We recognise that most of the officials within the Commission are extremely hard-working .
But we also recognise that some of the practices are outdated .
We look forward to reading the full Commission proposal on reform and we look forward to working out the detail alongside the Commission because , unlike what Mr Elles has just said , the Commissioner has made a commitment to discuss it with Parliament between now and 1 March .
We also need to recognise that people who live in glasshouses should not throw stones .
The European Parliament has not exactly been clean in its approach to things throughout its history .
We have a long way to go before we are perfect ourselves .
Our own staff policy is outdated .
Some of our working practices need radical reform .
I hope that the European Parliament will be hanging onto the coattails of the Commission in this reform process .
We recognise the proposals on activity-based budgeting .
We recognise that means discipline on the part of Commission officials and we recognise also that we have a responsibility within Parliament on discipline when we talk about negative priorities .
Finally , can I say that the Commission needs to work on its relationships with the public .
European taxpayers need to be re-assured .
The fate of the Commission , of the whole European Union , rests on delivery of this reform .
That is the key issue , delivery of these proposals .
Can I begin by stating for the record and for the enlightenment of Mrs Langenhagen that the decision for me not to address the full plenary tomorrow and therefore be available for formal responses on the report is not mine and not the Commission 's - it was the decision of this Parliament !
