there to investigate the best solutions to billing issues .
On other aspects , early next year , we will present an interim report on the internal market which discusses where we have got to and where we want to go , so that everyone - whether in the companies concerned , in national politics or in Parliament - is aware that in the case of gas and electricity , there is a lot of sermonising about the internal market , but in practice , during the week , this tends to be contradicted and not implemented .
Massive investment - both public and private - is therefore required .
In other words , I will fight to ensure that we obtain ongoing funding for infrastructure investments - not only Europe-wide investments , but also investments for retrofitting equipment locally and domestically - and I am counting on your support in this .
In our opinion , consumer tariffs should generally be based on costs in order to provide consumers with incentives for saving energy and to encourage supply companies to make the right investments .
Subject : Oil drilling in the Mediterranean A few months after the incident in the Gulf of Mexico and under an agreement concluded in 2007 , British Petroleum is apparently preparing to begin drilling five new oil wells in Libyan territorial waters some 600 kilometres from the coasts of Sicily , Malta and Greece .
We are talking for the time being about European regions , specifically the Mediterranean .
It is firstly a matter of making the highest standards that are technically feasible worldwide our own , either via the Member States or at a European level .
As far as assistance for these regions is concerned , there are various cooperation programmes for this region of the Czech Republic , Austria and Bavaria that have been awarded nearly EUR 430 million in subsidies in the current period .
That required further such investigations and assessments , which have now been carried out .
Due to the unfortunate number of disasters that have occurred , I have now embarked on a new initiative .
For this reason , the Commission presented the Green Paper on territorial cohesion in order to initiate a comprehensive process of debate .
The Commission has therefore created the Inter-Service Group on Territorial Cohesion , which includes representatives of the various Directorates-General .
We also have a range of very different options in the area of state subsidies - in the area of competition policy , for example - and we should use these opportunities in the interests of the people concerned .
It is a never-ending task that needs new impetus time and time again .
Like everything , however , it is also a political issue .
That means that if an aircraft takes off in Washington and lands in the European Union , then it will fall within the emissions trading system of the European Union .
Is there a Plan B in this event ?
What will we do then ?
All of them must make a contribution to climate protection in the European emissions trading system unless their home countries recognise comparable systems for reducing emissions from international aviation .
After all , one of the reasons why Copenhagen was such a flop and a disaster was that the European Union had no objectives .
These unfair framework conditions need to be changed , otherwise we can forget about our climate targets .
I believe that what we witnessed was - at least in two cases - the rebellion of the Heads of Government against the European reality .
Can anyone here imagine us still being able to solve any sort of monetary policy problem at national level ?
I therefore agree one hundred percent with people who say : when there are problems in individual cases with individual citizens - regardless of which country they come from - in an EU Member State , that Member State and its authorities are obliged to deal with these problems , and if these problems are criminal in nature , then they are obliged to pursue criminal proceedings in this regard .
I really cannot understand why that is not worthy of an apology .
It also proves wrong all those who believe that a new phase of renationalisation is now starting .
I hope that , on the issue of economic governance , we will get the same level of coherence here in this House as we did on this issue of supervision .
However - and this is simply our assessment - we still need to take some further steps in order to arrive at a truly effective new regulation of the financial markets , to get to a point where , through European regulations , we can prevent another crisis like the one we have just experienced .
Hence , the assistance given to Greece was extremely controversial from a legal point of view , if not downright unlawful .
I voted in favour of the report , as the new regulations are , in my view , sufficient to guarantee the safety of patients .
However , agriculture must continue to be able to do its job of producing safe food and feed at a reasonable cost .
I voted in favour of the report on macro-prudential oversight of the financial system and establishing a European Systemic Risk Board as this is a significant part of the new financial market architecture in the EU and the package represents a major step towards regulation of the financial markets .
We MEPs have made good use of the political weight that we have had since the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force on 1 December 2009 .
It is not only industry that is affected , but it is also the creative industries , sport and the music industry
