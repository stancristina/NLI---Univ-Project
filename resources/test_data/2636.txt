The financial markets are playing an increasingly great role in Europe 's economy .
A report published last week by the Commission shows that full financial integration in the EU will in the long term increase the EU 's GNP by 1.1 % .
Increased financial integration , however , also creates a need for improved cooperation on financial supervision in the EU and greater vigilance as regards financial stability .
The development of the financial markets in recent years has underlined these needs .
The interinstitutional agreements that were entered into in connection with the securities markets will naturally also apply in the extended structure .
For several reasons it is important and imperative that this new structure be extended to include the banking and insurance sectors : Firstly , the new structure will contribute to financial stability and effective harmonisation of financial regulation by creating a framework for effective cooperation and convergence between the financial supervisory authorities .
Secondly , the circumstances which gave rise to the introduction of the Lamfalussy procedure in the securities sector are also present in the banking and insurance sectors .
The common rules are also implemented differently in the various Member States .
There is a need to be able to react faster than the current structure allows .
The new structure also paves the way for drawing a better distinction between the heart of the matter , that is to say , what is politically central , and what can be left to implementing decisions that can be adjusted on an ongoing basis in line with changing market conditions .
Although the Commission is not expected to produce its proposal on Basle II until spring 2004 , it would nonetheless be useful for the new structure to be in place at an early stage .
Thirdly , the new structure is necessary in order to secure efficiency in connection with the EU 's forthcoming enlargement .
The Banking Advisory Committee , which currently carries out both level 2 and 3 tasks , has 3 members from each state ( that is , one from the ministry , one from the supervisory authority and one from the central bank ) .
Harmonisation and convergence of European supervisory practice can best be promoted by establishing a uniform structure for all sectors .
The new supervisory structure will ensure that organisation of the exercise of supervision remains a national task and will create a more transparent committee structure without mixed mandates as is the case at present in the banking and insurance sectors .
It thus establishes good cooperation on supervision across the sectors and creates a good and clear distribution of responsibility .
The political and technical discussions will initially take place in separate fora , allowing the process to take place more quickly because work can be carried on at a technical level in parallel .
And finally , it will create a greater correlation between the rules in the individual parts of the financial sector .
It is necessary to find a good structure for the role of the European Parliament in connection with the devising of overall policy guidelines for the financial sphere and I am convinced that this will be possible .
As a starting point , I imagine regular meetings between the chairman of the restructured FSPG , the Commission and the European Parliament in order to strengthen the dialogue on the main policy guidelines for financial services .
With regard to the restructured FSPG and its role in the devising of policy in the financial sphere we would take into account the European Parliament 's concerns .
Rather , the restructured FSPG would provide an overview and advise the Council and the Commission .
The Council notes that if the new structure is to be able to take effect the European Parliament considers it essential that the legislative system in the EU is altered such that a clear distinction is made between primary and secondary legal acts and that there are the necessary revocation clauses .
As is well known , the Council cannot , as an institution , make decisions that impose obligations on the Convention or the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference .
As president of the Ecofin Council I can assure you that I both can and will encourage my colleagues to make their Heads of State and Government aware of the importance of this topic and at the same time call upon them to deliberate and discuss this issue during their preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference .
It is very important that the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference give consideration to a legislative system that allows greater efficiency in the legislative process and respects the principle of subsidiarity and the powers of the institutions involved .
It is essential that a solution is found in respect of both the challenges faced by the financial sectors and the challenges faced by the Community as a whole .
We must all be aware , however , that this is a broad issue which does not solely concern financial legislation .
As far as I can see , we agree on the essence of the problem that we are attempting to solve .
I see too that note has been taken of the Commission 's report on the growth opportunities in the financial sphere through the introduction of the new structures , the inference being that we can contribute to growth and employment .
I also have a couple of individual comments , particularly to Mr Herzog , who says that I said , or let it be understood , that I was in favour of unitary supervision .
We are advocating national supervision , that is to say a national solution , and then we must cooperate within the EU.
To Mrs van den Burg , I can say that I understand her views regarding the content
