The Council should be informed of a Franco-German initiative on subsidiarity , decided on at the bilateral meeting in Avignon on 6 and 7 May last .
It states that the overall policy mix will promote growth and employment if all the participants and groups comply with the guidelines it has summarized ( p . 4 ) .
We too deplore these serious shortcomings and we consider that the solution should obviously be sought in terms of greater flexibility and a reduction of mandatory levies .
My country hosts nearly 20 % of the 380 000 frontier workers employed in the European Union .
I hope that this status will be understood by all and accepted by all .
In this context , the Cohesion Fund , rather than offering a genuine solution to the overwhelming problems of certain regions of Europe , may simply serve as a stop-gap to limit the repercussions .
I agree entirely with the comments concerning the budgetary implementation and , especially , the invitation extended to Member States to comply with the three-month deadline for transferring appropriations to the designated recipients .
Finally , a special effort must be devoted to the question of transport .
I am happy to accept that it was a corrigendum and that we therefore had recitals A to K. What is certain now is that we should have arranged them in the same order in the voting list .
In fact , I think that as regards requests for roll-call votes , it is not just a question of having the exact result , but it is also a question of knowing how the votes are divided up for each group .
We cannot ask these countries to define the criteria for aid , and therefore conversely those relating to the suspension of the Convention , without involving them in the decision to suspend aid to their country .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , will the European Union be able to ensure that the ban on importing fur from animals captured in leghold traps is respected throughout its territory ?
Today , it is the protection of the environment which is at issue ; tomorrow , it will be social clauses or our culture which will be harmed .
It has turned into a novel , a thriller , a thriller about leghold traps and 13 animal species .
As regards the substance , the Commission is happy ; it obtains a further delay of three to five additional years , with the United States simply proposing to us that they go even further in this unacceptable situation , in this monstrosity .
They have in general supported me , and I should therefore like to thank them for this .
This reduction , caused by monetary erosion , will be accompanied by another reduction in prices and compensatory aids of about 2 % , according to estimates , which will be caused by the disappearance of the green ECU with the introduction of the euro .
Unlike other major agricultural product areas , the common organization of the market in wine has not been reformed for 15 years .
The Commission has chosen the easiest solution : reduction of the premium to discourage a further rise in production .
The reform of the common agricultural policy which is proposed in Agenda 2000 raises a large number of questions and some concerns .
However , on behalf of my group , I have tabled two amendments which revise the conclusions of the opinion on the basis of the Commission 's latest proposals .
The quality of products , their processing , their suitability in terms of international demand and dynamic commercial policies , as well as low prices , are capable of increasing our export potential .
The report originally submitted to us by Mr Cunha was a good report .
It is estimated that 21 % of the complaints addressed to the WTO are about Europe , and more than one third of the complaints come from the United States .
We must protect it by improving the quality of our products and by increasing their added value , which justifies high prices and the exportation of our model .
By prices rather than subsidies .
It would be more logical if we adopted exactly the opposite stance instead of the Commission 's proposal : for animals which have a market value , it would be logical to use the most humane traps .
If a drifting gill net of limited length is environmentally acceptable and not detrimental to resources , it must be acceptable for all fishermen , in every sea and every ocean .
When I entered Parliament in 1989 , agricultural prices were discussed with great ceremony .
We are nevertheless pleased that in response to the amendment we tabled asking for the set-aside rate to be set by the end of this month , that is , for a decision on the set-aside rate to be adopted at the same time as the prices package , the Commission has proposed a new regulation applicable to the forthcoming agricultural year .
Rosado Fernandes report ( A4-0218/98 ) The Commission plans to create a quota buy-back system , the stated aim of which is to decrease the volume of tobacco produced in Europe gradually .
The problem of tobacco is like the problem of drifting gill nets .
I call for appropriate measures to defend the interests of producers , inasmuch as the internal market offers great potential for the development of production and jobs in this sector .
A model based on enlargement , the WTO model , or a distorted European model ?
It is quite understandable that young people are reluctant to enter agriculture when they hear that Agenda 2000 intends to take 10 % off milk , 20 % off cereals and 30 %
