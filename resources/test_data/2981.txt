In our opinion , the essential thing is not to look for political conflict , but to use the right tools for the benefit of our citizens .
The main responsibility for achieving results lies with the Member States as far as the liberalisation of markets and the making of electronic commerce cheaper for consumers are concerned .
Greed will bring its own revenge in that the system will be made expensive and will be slow to establish itself .
We are on the threshold of enlargement .
As we now step on the gas with regard to an eEurope within the Union , are we making it more difficult for those countries joining the Union to adapt ?
The answer is , in fact , a question : are enlargement , which has been planned , albeit relatively slowly , and the budget in accordance with the decisions of Agenda 2000 , mutually compatible ?
The PPE-DE Group and , to the best of my knowledge , the whole of Parliament , support the Commission ' s work while voicing constructive criticism .
Mr President , Commissioner , food safety gets people talking perhaps more than any other issue , and , for that reason , it is good that it also gets us talking here in Parliament .
I would like to express my thanks too : it is a good basis for better standards of consumer safety throughout the European Union .
We have plenty of examples of consumers not having always been given priority when it comes to food production .
As the issue here is about food , it is even more important than ever to ensure that this freedom is also responsibly restricted , that consumers are protected , and that they have a right to know what they are eating .
I agree with this .
Labels must also be made compulsory as quickly as possible .
Madam President , I have been listening to the translations of the speeches on my headphones for a long time now , and the sound disappears sometimes , even if I change places , and I also get a rasping noise , not only here but also in our Group ' s room .
Even the position of my head affects audibility , and I cannot really sit here listening with my head tilted to one side .
So whenever someone shouts into the microphone - even though they should not - I would ask that the sound volume in the Chamber be lowered immediately , so that we can also hear what is being said over the headphones .
We have to find answers to the challenge of enlargement , but the Union at its present size also needs to re-establish the rules of the game and the decision-making process .
This will come about by increasing genuine transparency and by developing the way administration actually serves the people .
The Commission must be given support while it puts the changes into effect , but the Council and Parliament must also themselves be able to work to strengthen confidence among our citizens .
We have seen that matters of taxation , for example , have become stumbling blocks .
We all have a lot to gain and protect in a common Europe .
In my opinion , we need more than that .
Mr President , an essential element in the reconstruction of post-war society is always that recovery of the local economy should be as rapid as possible , so that it becomes viable once more .
Many entrepreneurs are naturally very bitter about this consequent stagnation in activity .
Mr President-in-Office , I thank you for this reply .
They were not able to before .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office , European defence policy is at present being drafted , and different countries are involved in the task .
There are Member States in NATO and there are countries which are not in NATO .
All the languages of Europe are equally valuable and worthy of respect in terms of culture .
Language is the most peaceful way of communicating .
Language is a powerful force .
It is the most important bond for a nation .
It is a means of occupation .
That is why we have guaranteed the important status of minority languages .
The multilingual nature of Europe must be preserved after enlargement too ; there are no obstacles to this .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am speaking for our 'shadow ' rapporteur , Mr Vatanen , and I would like to mention that this is now the fifth time since 1993 and the introduction of the common organisation of the market in bananas that the WTO has considered the Community rules to run counter to international trade regulations .
I congratulate the Commission for striving to reach a compromise that has regard to the various interest groups .
I would like to express my concern regarding the consequences of Mr Dary ' s report for trade policy .
For this reason , I would appeal to you to support Mr Chichester ' s Amendment No 38 , which states that if the EU does not abolish import quotas it will at least indicate its intention to start official WTO talks on the future distribution of import quotas .
Secondly , if our trading partners receive permission from the WTO to even disregard intellectual property rights , the costs of sanctions will be enormous and could cause long-term damage to EU businesses .
Thirdly , continued breaches of the regulations will hurt our image internationally in matters of trade , which might weaken the case for the European agricultural subsidy model .
It is high time we showed ourselves to be credible and mature trading partners , as waking up to the realities of the present will accord with our real interests in the long
