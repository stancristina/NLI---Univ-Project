Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mrs Van Lancker , who has supplemented the Commission 's already excellent report with amendments tabled by myself .
I consider the social policy agenda to be an extremely important political document which identifies instruments , sectors of intervention and timeframes and guarantees positive , dynamic interaction between economic , social and employment policies .
I would like to take this opportunity to raise a few general points regarding European competition policies and also the competitiveness and opening-up of the European markets , not in order to deny any progress made thusfar , but with a view to the future .
And , naturally , these are clearly statements to which the ears of the various Ministers for the Treasury in Europe are extremely sensitive .
Of course , there is the Treaty of Amsterdam , but I wonder whether the constraints imposed by the governments on the excellent work of your predecessor should , in any case , be justified as a way of exempting these companies from European competition rules .
My feeling is that , together , we are making progress in helping the citizens to understand this policy .
As far as monopolies are concerned , the Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation on the matter on 27 September last .
One of the things I appreciate is your call for an increase in human resources .
The Commission has continued to intervene resolutely , particularly where cartels and abuse of a dominating position are concerned .
Several Members - Mrs Riis-Jørgensen , Mr Schmidt , Mr Blokland and Mrs Kauppi - have posed the problem of large companies operating in relatively small countries .
But the Commission should not and will not give its ultimate responsibility of taking decisions to an external body .
We will pursue that point with determination .
Mr Della Vedova , the presence of public companies raises competition problems and - although it is possible and I have , of course , to confirm that the Treaty provides for neutrality with regard to private or public ownership - it is possible to intervene in the event of distortion : the instruments are those which you mentioned , the instruments on the control of State aid and on the abuse of dominant positions .
Of course , Parliament has a very important role to play in this respect .
At the same time , however , past experience tells us that we cannot reduce it by very much , for the very reason that the last time the mechanism was used , in 1993 , the loan was for EUR 8 billion .
The financial mechanism implements Article 119 of the EC Treaty , which only remains in force during the third stage of economic and monetary union for the Member States which are not participating in monetary union .
In future , recourse to the capital market should be the only option available .
It is my opinion that the Klass report should be adopted , particularly in view of the additional guarantees provided by amendments such as that tabled by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development which clarifies the reference to directive 90/220 , in the form in which it is going to be amended in respect of GMOs .
Its aim is to strengthen the internal market in the sector in question , to update the legislation in the light of technical and scientific progress which has taken place since it was last updated and to ensure that authorisation for genetically modified varieties can only be granted if the appropriate steps have been taken to avoid endangering human health or the environment .
I am happy to be able to inform you that we can also accept Amendments Nos 35 to 40 , tabled by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , which are intended to reinforce the transposal of the safety and management requirements according to directive 90/220 .
The amendment has been accepted .
Therefore , the Council must stop making excuses and express an opinion .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I regret that Mr Barón Crespo has not remained in the Chamber after pointing the finger at the political force which I represent .
And Mr Barón Crespo should also ask his Italian colleagues to account for the vehement declarations made against the Jews in Israel , declarations which throw further fuel on the fire of a spreading anti-Semitic feeling which is already too violent in Europe .
And he should also request information from the current leaders , who used to belong to the Democratic Left Party and who were leaders of the Italian Communist Party at the time when certain elements of the Communist Party helped one of the murderers of Aldo Moro ' s bodyguards to escape from Italy to Algeria .
It expresses the idea , that is , that island status is in itself an adequate criterion .
The effects of development , progress , news and communications , however , have always reached that island , as they have reached other islands , years later than elsewhere .
I represent the constituency which contains the two largest islands in the Mediterranean - Sicily and Sardinia - and I can say in all honesty that both islands are severely disadvantaged in structural terms precisely because they are islands .
In our opinion , the new Constitution should even be ready to enter into force by the next European elections .
Pensioners and the elderly - who , like everybody else , would like to have a healthy circulation - therefore approve of the fact that , every so often , I am able to introduce a lighter note into our proceedings , such as this preamble to my explanation of why I voted for the Trakatellis report .
Yesterday , I
