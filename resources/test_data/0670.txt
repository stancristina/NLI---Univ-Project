As regards financial matters , Mr President , I would like to say that enlargement is necessary , but it brings up issues concerning the level of funding for the programmes .
For this reason , prior to enlargement , we need to revise our financial prospects for the European Union .
However , I would like to make a few comments concerning certain omissions , gaps and inconsistencies contained in the report .
Madam President , while funds for Germany and Spain for 1994-1999 are increasing , they have been reduced in the case of Greece and Portugal , two of the poorest countries of the Community .
Madam President , Madam Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I totally share the views that have been expressed on the report under debate and I would like to stress that the assertion that , after ten years of action of the structural funds there continue to be enormous economic and social inequalities between the various regions of the European Union , means that the objective of economic and social cohesion is part of a long term , steady process .
Madam President , this process , which I believe is coming to an end with this evening 's debate and tomorrow 's vote , has indeed lasted many years .
It would have been difficult to achieve this without the persistence , the steadfastness , and the ability of Mrs Nicole Fontaine to reconcile those things which initially appeared impossible to reconcile .
The solution that is presented today is linked to three significant innovations : the permanent nature of establishment with the original professional qualification ; making it easier to obtain this qualification ; the practice of the profession in the welcoming Member State and the regulations concerning the collective practice of the profession .
This is no small step , Madam President .
Parliament , the Council and the Commission have done their duty .
Mr President , I would like to explain why I voted as I did on paragraph 51 , Amendment No 16 , referring to the policy to be adopted for the islands of the Aegean .
Mr President , this assessment is more general .
A joint foreign policy remained one of the demands and defence policy remained in the hands of a NATO which is not exclusively European and in which Europe does not play the leading role .
On this view , the Amsterdam Treaty may be regarded as an interim agreement .
The weaknesses that have been pointed out must not lead us , however , to feel disappointed and to condemn the treaty , nor to underestimate its advantages .
The analysis of the details of the treaty , which Mr MÃ©ndez de Vigo and Professor Tsatsos achieved with such great success and after a great deal of intense effort , leaves the final conclusion in no doubt .
Mr President , it has already become urgent for us to move forward to political dialogue without delay , because it would be dangerous to complete further enlargements without in-depth examination of the issues .
Mr President , I am in a position to know very well what is written in the final paragraph of the recommendation with regard to the obligations of the European Commission .
However , the issue which does not preoccupy the European Council , the European Commission nor the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy at all is the account of the consequences of the single market on the working people and citizens in the peripheral and weaker countries of the Union and on the economies of these countries .
The single market and Union policies are responsible for the dramatic deterioration of the position of SMEs , who find support from the Union and from the Member States in words alone , and not in deeds .
Mr President , I very much fear that the insistence on speeding up this policy , the promotion of certain recommendations such as the acceleration of economic and monetary union , the strict adherence to the stability pact , the transfer of funding sources for social protection from work to taxes on the environment and energy , the application of VAT in the country of origin , will worsen the already well-known consequences of the single market and will add tens of millions of people to the ranks of the unemployed .
However , I would like to make the following four comments : The first comment is that the single market , like the single currency , must be seen within the framework of a European Union which seeks to move at the same speed along the main roads that open up ahead of it .
As a result , from the moment we apply a programme until 2002 , we must at the same time adhere to the programme of cohesion and support for the less developed regions of the European Union until 2002 and not have hesitations and back-tracking in that area .
I think that the questions of lightening the tax burden of working people and of instituting an environmental tax are also very important .
Mr President , I think this is a waste of effort .
We must recognize that the forcing house in which organized crime germinates is the economic , social and political status quo that prevails in our countries .
Nor must we forget that this form of crime is closely linked to police , judicial and administrative authorities and also to political leaderships and governments .
Let us not forget the power of the drugs cartels , of arms smuggling and immigration , that is , modern-day slavery .
But this must be done with circumspection , since I very much fear that the expansion that has been introduced here will be a pretext for you to create a gaoler of liberties and a guard over the interests of the few , of
