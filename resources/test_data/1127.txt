, I join others in wishing Portugal every good wish for a successful presidency .
I notice that you said this particular issue was not currently on your agenda for the next IGC but if some people wished it , you would consider it .
Well , I , and my fellow 35 British Conservative MEPs wish it and would like you to please consider it .
I appreciate that it is a provocative question .
It is meant to provoke because there is a very serious issue here that some countries do not hold EU law in the respect which it deserves .
We have to find some way of putting pressure on such countries to do just that so we can reconnect with our citizens .
I cannot think of a better way to do it .
Can you ?
Madam President , I speak as someone who is in support of a tax on speculative capital movements across currency borders .
It seems to me blindingly self-evident that some action is necessary .
In the last 30 years , the volume of currency transactions has increased by 83 times : firstly , total global reserves of all central banks barely amounts to one day of foreign exchange trading ; secondly , annual global trade in real goods and services equals just three-and-a-half days of foreign exchange markets out of 350 , that is , 1 % of capital movements are for trade in goods and services and 99 % are for speculation .
The size , unpredictability and irrationality of the global foreign exchange markets have made it harder and harder to manage national and regional economies .
Computer-controlled selling programmes turned a random blip into an avalanche , burying jobs , lives and industries across the globe .
The only arguments against it are : firstly , it would impair the efficiency of the foreign exchange market - a little fanciful in light of the financial feeding frenzies we have seen that have destroyed jobs throughout the world , in East Asia , Europe and Latin America .
Mr Chirac has described those who engage in this as the Aids virus of the world economy .
What is necessary is to throw some sand into the wheels of the currency speculators , stockbrokers and option traders .
Of course , this cannot be done in one country ; it cannot be done within the single currency area , but it could be done at international level with global cooperation .
Europe , Japan and the US - the euro , the yen and the dollar , would constitute , in my opinion , such a block .
I am disappointed in the EPP.
I thought at least they read the resolutions they were going to vote on .
Yes , I am in favour of such a tax , but it is not what we are going to vote on tomorrow .
What we are going to vote on tomorrow is to ask the Commission to study the matter , to look at what steps and what conditions would be necessary for the introduction of such a tax .
Equally I understand the Commissioner failing to endorse such a tax , but I cannot understand why he failed to have the courage to welcome the opportunity to demonstrate the truth of his position by a study of the issue .
There is nothing so closed as a closed mind .
The tax has the support of 47 % of the people in the UK, according to a recent survey by War on Want .
In France it has had enormous resonance , particularly when linked to a demand to use the proceeds to help the Third World out of its debt and poverty .
This issue can no longer be ignored by Parliament , the Council or the Commission .
There is now a weight of public opinion demanding an answer more sophisticated than : " It has not been done before " .
In the new millennium , with new global problems requiring new global solutions , they need to give good arguments why it cannot be done now , rather than why it has not been done in the past .
Madame President , my group , the EDD , and especially my party , are very concerned by this debate .
We cannot , and we do not , support in any way the sentiments and politics of Herr Haider and we deplore his references to the Third Reich .
We also , however , deplore the fact that your Parliament should consider interfering in the policies of an elected government of any country , especially one which is part of the European Union .
My party at home are certainly not racists , but we do not accept the rule or interference of the European Union very well .
Are you going to interfere with Great Britain' s Parliament if we are elected ?
Madame President , the people of Austria have spoken by electing Herr Haider to their Parliament .
I believe they gave him 28 % of the vote so there is going to be a coalition government .
Your Parliament , may I suggest , Madame President , should wait to see if the party of Haider has an effect on the policies of that country .
Then , and only then , might you consider if human rights are affected .
Your Parliament may consider measures appropriate to counter that situation and then , Madame President and only then , may your Parliament consider interfering in the constitutional affairs of a country of the European Union .
Madam President , this debate was opened by Mr Da Costa , who merely confirms that the EU presidency is trying to influence the composition of a government of one of the Member States .
