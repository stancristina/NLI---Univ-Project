asked to be protected which means that those who have asked are not protected .
Their reports propose the creation of legal instruments , namely an 'anti-discrimination ' directive and follow up the decision by the Council to create a European Observatory for which there is already a draft regulation .
Concerning one of these amendments , I should like to remind you of the title of a book by the Mozambican writer , Mia Couto , ' Each Man is a Race ' .
I should like just highlight four points from this report .
Self-control , I repeat self-control , by the media should lessen the negative effects of giving too much publicity to terrorist activities .
But if violence is imposed on us then we have to have appropriate means , not just preventive ones , in order effectively to combat terrorist activities .
I came here in order to be closer to the source , closer to the place where decisions are made which could shape - for better or for worse - our own lives .
This is a great challenge which all of us must take up and try to meet .
Above all we must have a compulsory cultural aspect in the projects of other areas funded by the Structural Funds .
However good the proposals made officially , experience has been extremely hard and inefficiencies have been shown up - together with the harm done to people 's well-being which accumulated in a socialist system where market conditions were ignored and , because there was no democracy , people 's rights were not necessarily respected .
By supporting this restructuring , as it has been doing , the European Union would show , without the shadow of a doubt , that it really does want to find the right solution to this problem .
Giving support to products and transfers of ecological technologies is something which is relevant and a natural approach for developing a European Union with greater internal cohesion .
We , therefore , find it hard to comprehend the huge relative deficit and even the virtual non-existence of basic infrastructures supporting economic activities in the cohesion countries , from transport to the infrastructures related to water supplies and provision - for example , in my country using the waters of the Alqueva - and it is incomprehensible that these should not be analysed with more thoroughness .
Because , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , they hit at the heart of the matter .
Let us not lower the tone of the debate by attributing the defence of this point of view to national interests .
And I will be the first , ladies and gentlemen , to urge my country to do the same .
Any position based on Article 2 of the Treaty of Rome , which the Maastricht Treaty did not alter , defining the general objectives of the association of the Member States , and on Article 117 , which Maastricht also did not change , or undermine , clearly imposing the principle of political orientation , almost appears strange since it is becoming increasingly necessary .
As the results of a point in the opinion issued by the Committee on Economic Questions , by Mr Theonas , I should like to say that we really must begin to look upon the social aspect as the very kernel of all discussions as well as the organisation of men and women 's free time , articulating working time and leisure time , and we should not refer to 'unemployed ' time because there can be and has to be , also , living time .
Of course , I think that the Commission should be punished because , as it is the body chosen by governments , it is also a sort of joint government commission .
They have raised all kinds of arguments - that there was a government vacuum in Europe , that the market has been given preference over people 's health , as we all know that the Commission could have defended both the market and public health , in the same way and at the same time .
Political cowardice does exist , and there is nothing to be done about it .
But personally I find that it is not so hard for me to do so and also I rather like many of the present Commissioners .
As far as the Olsson report is concerned , I would like to know why the Commission is presenting directives and not regulations ?
We should also specify which controls the animals have been subjected to .
From this point of view , we are suffering the effects of the 'non-existence of Europe ' .
At least , that is what the newspapers tell us !
From this point of view , the Commission is guilty because , as it is the guardian of the Treaties , it should not hide behind public morality , it should not hide behind controls and it should discuss the possibility of funding activities in the various countries where it should be carried out .
That is why we are voting in favour of this report and the motion closing this debate .
Commissioner , this document is bad .
In this case , I promise her that all of us , in all of the political groups , from every part of the spectrum , will be here to support a report which has just four or five priorities for political action to help consumers in the coming years .
A few years ago the European Parliament - I was one of its authors - tabled a motion increasing the budgetary amounts for consumer protection associations in order to give them more support especially in the countries where they are lacking , such as Ireland and the southern countries of Europe , and also giving support to smaller associations
