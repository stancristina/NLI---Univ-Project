You are less of a lobbyist than the Members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development because the three dossiers presented by that committee are worse than the proposal from the Commission itself .
Mr President , I should like the President-in-Office to clarify a statement by his colleague , the Minister for Foreign Affairs , who yesterday said that we should reform the common agricultural policy in order to reduce the expenditure of the European Union .
These amendments relate to so-called 'business tourism ' - conventions , congresses and business travel - which already accounts for nearly 20 % of European tourism and is highly likely not only to increase significantly in the medium term , but also to compensate for one of the most complicated phenomena in the tourist sector , namely seasonal variations .
It must be borne in mind that competition in this sector is quite tough , despite Europe having exceptional conditions in terms of its supply .
Information is now the key to everything , turning us into listed consumers of classified products .
Consumers are being violated and the applicable law is contradictory , incoherent or even non-existent .
It is obvious that the disparity between north and south has increased in the last few decades despite economic growth .
However , the Socialist Group 's motion for a resolution does not represent a blank cheque for the Commission .
We therefore decided to vote in favour of discharge in December 's part-session .
During this crisis , the Portuguese socialists have constantly tried to defend the interests of Portugal and the overall interests of Europe , which would certainly not have benefited from the fall of the Commission a few months before the European elections in June .
This genuinely Dantesque process consisting of somewhat shadowy intentions is , in my opinion , hiding rather undignified manoeuvres and simply intolerable objectives .
I find this totally unacceptable .
The shooting down of two cargo planes chartered by MONUA , causing the death of 23 people , represented a new level of disregard for all the international agreements and institutions .
It has not disarmed or facilitated the extension of the state administration and it has disregarded all the accords and all the previous resolutions of the UN Security Council .
Plundering and prospering on Angola 's God-given wealth , leaving millions of war and famine victims to die , is a crime against humanity .
Personally , I believe that the Angolan problem is basically a question of trust , and the climate of distrust is the fault of both sides , not just of UNITA.
The presence of the United Nations was not welcomed as was promised .
The UN representative was prevented from talking with the real and historic UNITA and the mistrust has grown .
We want the weapons to be silenced , the peace process to be restarted , UNITA to agree to abide by the Lusaka protocol and the UN decisions , and the UN to decide to extend the mandate of MONUA in order to secure the conditions needed to help the refugees and to proceed with the emergency food aid .
The developments in Indonesia had led to the belief that the conditions were being created for the negotiation of peaceful solutions .
As we have said , this motion for a resolution is extremely urgent and opportune .
We cannot have two levels of response and two approaches , as demonstrated by the desire of some people to condemn Pinochet and to absolve Suharto .
Since the crackdown against the civilian population in Alas in November , the news reaching us from East Timor , despite being diluted by the censure of the military authorities , has contained worrying signs of repeated human rights abuses .
We will not give up and we believe that the European Parliament should continue to cooperate through the motions for resolutions it has approved and through the one before us today , which we are proposing jointly with colleagues from other parties .
This House has also had an important role to play in the debate on this issue by highlighting the problems of Timor and the violations of human rights .
Moreover , in addition to the basic need to keep this issue alive , there are always new reasons provided by Indonesia - due to its military occupation and repression - to justify this insistence and repetition .
We do not totally agree with this proposal , not just due to the precise terms chosen but also due to the fact that we believe there is an omission or an aspect that is not sufficiently developed in the report .
We have the honour of being the first signatory of the motion for a resolution on child labour that is contained in this report .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , with regard to codes of conduct for multinational enterprises operating in developing countries , the position of this group can be summed up as follows .
The rapporteur measures with extraterritorial effect covering human and workers ' rights , the environment and the prevention of corruption .
In terms of Parliament 's role , we are not in favour of a temporary European Monitoring Platform under the auspices of Parliament , nor of the appointment of special rapporteurs within this as these proposals seem to involve activities that do not fall within the competence of a parliamentary assembly .
The governments of developing countries must be made take responsibility for the implementation of standards that respect fundamental labour principles and rights .
Although sharing some of the concerns of our colleague Mrs GÃ¼nther , we congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Howitt , on the report he has presented .
A few months ago in this House , Commissioner Deus Pinheiro threw down the challenge involving the need to consider how
