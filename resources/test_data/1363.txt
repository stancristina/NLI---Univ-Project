the proportion of the population over the age of 65 will rise from 16.1 % in 2000 to 22 % in 2025 and 27 % in 2050 , that is a third of the population .
The safeguarding and further improvement of high quality social protection and health care provision in the Member States , based on the principle of solidarity and accessibility to healthcare for all concerned , will be necessary in order to fully attain the goals of financial viability , accessibility and quality .
I believe that having a ' Social Europe ' is the only way that we will move from being a Europe of banks and money to a Europe of people and peoples .
Qualitative principles in the field of health care can be put into effect through the creation of specialised higher training for nurses , financed by European training funds , which encourage people to obtain further professional qualifications in important areas such as oncology , transplants , heart surgery and all the age-related diseases .
The mobility and retraining of the unemployed engineering workers who hold an advanced secondary education qualification could be achieved by providing them with access to information on nursing .
I shall not give any further examples , since the world is such a big and terrible place .
I have personally seen the progress made this year , especially in Kabul - schools reopened , girls studying journalism - but at the same time , I have seen and heard that key figures such as military leaders and the United States have allowed human rights failures , which are still apparent .
Europe must continue to do its part ; we cannot take a different path : we must give continuity to our work and our commitment .
Members of the various terrorist networks are not only continuing to operate in areas of Afghanistan not yet controlled by the government but , in fact , live and are active in bordering countries and are operationally linked with areas which have become centres for attracting and recruiting others , such as certain areas of Somalia and South-East Asia .
Therefore , these ex post lessons must offset what existed in the past with what , with difficulty , the international community and the Karzai Government are trying , clearly with numerous problems , to establish .
The progress made in one year since the first Bonn Conference is truly remarkable , and likewise we should applaud the determination , selflessness and competence of our Commission officials in Kabul .
This is an urgent appeal that I am making to the European Union and to us all lest we forget this : there is no chance of making progress or finding a way out of this situation unless women are directly involved in this process .
I must say that fish , which I have helped and supported for a long time with regard to reports concerning them , have spread the word that Mr Fatuzzo helps and listens to animals , and consequently the news has spread from them to many other animal species .
In particular , I feel that not giving a disability pension to European citizens just because they are over 65 , whereas one would be granted before , is discrimination , and that is why I gladly approved this report .
Mr President , the Pensioners ' Party , which I represent here , strongly approves of this report on the European Union 's management of the external borders of our 15 Member States , soon to become 25 , and shortly thereafter , 27 .
Mr President , the proposals contained in the document tabled by Mr Mario Mantovani on the future of health care and care for the elderly that we have adopted , is perfect , and we should approve every single line , as I did .
This is not war ; it is about bringing peace and building on it where there is need ' .
We are pleased to note that Lebanon has signed the International Convention on Women 's Rights and the Convention against Torture .
Lastly , we hope that the Agreement will support economic reforms and trade , which were already important issues .
I would therefore urge us to go further than the - albeit important - decisions of the last Interministerial Conference in Valencia .
Lebanon 's rebirth could lie in that strength which previously was its weakness : the intertwining of cultures and religions , rooted in the country but different from each other .
This is , in many ways , understandable , but in the past , even the recent past - with the Russian crisis and so on - problems have emerged that have led to unsatisfactory or even downright disastrous results , as in the case I have just mentioned of the Russian crisis , which affected the EBRD as well as many other international financial institutions .
This is admirable , but we are giving with one hand and taking away with the other through trade restrictions which weigh very heavily on a country like the Ukraine .
Its institutional commitment is to invest in any country that is inspired by democratic principles and determined to promote a market economy .
In conclusion , I would just like to ask the Commissioner to pay greater attention to the two issues that Parliament wants to raise : first , the changes in the FIFG regulation , the financial regulation , particularly as regards young people 's start-up and the modernisation of farms ; and secondly , the natural disaster fund .
Commissioner , one cannot declare how valuable and useful an economic sector is without then taking consistent measures to sustain it .
Another objective - one which Parliament is particularly concerned with - is food safety , environmental impact and animal health
