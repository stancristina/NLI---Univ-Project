the environment and the quality of life in cities .
This will lead to better compliance with current environmental legislation and to improved cohesion between the various political and the various administrative levels .
The mobility of European citizens in the education and training sector makes an important contribution towards improving the quality of their knowledge and broadening their experiences and skills and , at the same time , it is a unique tool for mutual understanding and better knowledge of the various cultures which make up Europe .
This is linked , among other things , to various practices and omissions on the part of the Member States , which directly or indirectly restrict the mobility of young Europeans .
Within this framework , use of the Europass must also be strengthened .
With respect for European values and our social sensitivities and with knowledge as our epicentre , we can follow a development course , bearing in mind that the globalisation of economic activity , social progress and environmental protection are based on the continuous development of new skills and the use of new technologies .
To close , I should like to congratulate Mr Mann .     – Mr President , in order to proceed smoothly on its road towards accession , Turkey needs to do the same as the previous candidate countries and comply with its contractual obligations , such as opening up its ports and airports to Cyprus 's ships and aircraft and lifting its veto on Cyprus 's participation in international organisations and multilateral treaties .
We , the Progressive Party of the Working People of Cyprus , are working for the resolution of the Cyprus problem and for respect for the human rights of all Cypriots , both Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots .
This sort of thinking is unnecessary and will lead us into unwanted complications .     – Mr President , may I start by congratulating Mr Eurlings on his excellent work and on his report .
The same applies when he speaks of institutional reforms , the same applies when he speaks of a peaceful resolution to differences and the same applies when he calls for the signature of the Ankara protocol to be honoured and for this protocol to be applied immediately .
This paragraph is the outcome of broad agreement and must remain as it stands .
Firstly , because we are against the accession of Turkey to the European Union for the same reasons that we were against the accession of Greece , not for cultural reasons .
We therefore ask : between the previous report and now , has anything specific been done in these sectors ?
No, Turkey continues to provocatively ignore all these decisions and you continue along exactly the same lines .
However , with post-enlargement fatigue and the institutional crisis in the European Union , we do not need to add contradictory messages to Turkey .
In fact , the statement by the deputy prime minister of the Turkish government , Mr Mehmet Ali Sahin , in the Turkish Daily News , that his government does not intend to allow the Halki Seminary to reopen is a cause of anxiety and concern .
We need to remain constant in our support for Turkey 's strategic objective of accession to the European Union .
The syndrome of the Treaty of Sèvres .
Our specific amendment does not impose new preconditions on Turkey .
The remaining Member States must of course notify their plans .
Letters have already been sent out drawing the attention of the Member States to their obligations .
This will allow the Commission to take decisions on most of the emission rights market before Christmas and to complete the evaluation procedure by the spring of 2007 .
The importance of this tool is reflected in the agreement of all the institutions of the European Union .
The proposal is another step in the direction of the enlargement of judicial cooperation and the development of confidence between the Member States in the field of justice .
The regulation of procedural issues has been left within the framework of the other proposal which is pending in the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs and is being processed by our honourable friend and rapporteur Díaz de Mera .
Thus , in the event of a conviction for a crime which does not exist in the Member State trying the new case , the conviction is not taken into account .
However , it is important for the Council to proceed as quickly as possible with the approval of the drastic proposal for the minimum criteria in criminal proceedings , which was voted through many months ago by the European Parliament and will strengthen the above principles .
Why is the Council delaying on such an important issue ?
Now we are approving the Commission decision to establish a new system , on the basis of which the Member States will be able to take account , in criminal proceedings , of previous convictions against the same person handed down in another Member State of the European Union .
Finally , I hope that the statement by the Finnish Presidency will not remain a statement , but will start to be put into practice .
Achieving the objective of economic and social cohesion during the new programming period does indeed constitute a difficult challenge , at a time when inequalities in enlarged Europe are increasing and funds for applying cohesion policy are restricted .
In the new programming period and in light of the interim review , the cohesion policy will be called upon to prove – if I may say so – its raison d 'être and the need for it to continue .
However , the question that arises is : is the legislation which we have voted through the best
