Principally the Economic Union&#x02BC ;s current policy gives rise to high unemployment , reduced economic demand and to a dramatic deterioration in social welfare levels in Member States .
It is the remains of an out of date way of thinking .
I would like to point out that the neutral policy in these Member States has significant popular support .
With regard to the environment , there is strong resistance to a tightening of Article 100a( 4 ) which would give Member States the true right to have tougher environmental legislation in some areas .
Personally , I am convinced that such referenda would show that there is no support in many Member States for greatly increased central power within the European Union .
Not so long ago we , in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , received a visit from the Irish presidency which then held forth with much tougher speeches than is currently the case .
In addition , we in the Green Party have continuously emphasised that , while we justifiably criticise the Israeli government fiercely , we must also remind our Palestinian friends that maintaining democracy and freedom of speech in the Palestinian areas is a fundamental requirement of a successful peace process .
The initiative taken by the UN to focus on the world &#x02BC ;s poverty problems and on the fact that the differences between poor and rich and South and North are growing all the time is absolutely necessary .
Unfortunately this year , and this day has perhaps not been observed as it ought to have been .
We politicians , of course , have a particular responsibility in this respect .
The resolution raises many important aspects , particularly the focus on the 52 million poor in Europe .
Dear colleagues , let us not only show solidarity when we vote for the resolution but also when we vote for the budget here tomorrow .
The peace process has come to a halt ; not much is happening .
Many sections within the EU have complained that EU activity , economic assistance and strong action on the Middle East conflict has gone on relatively unseen .
I must say that I am extremely surprised that this has been allowed to happen .
This can only be interpreted as a lack of interest on the part of the European Parliament or that party political deliberation must take precedence over serious action for peace .
Mr President !
Free and democratic elections for Parliament and President have now been held several times in Russia .
But perhaps someone is asking themselves : " Has this chap not realised how unstable the situation in Russia is , with a large reactionary socialist party , right-wing nationalist loudmouths such as Zhirinovsky , with Chechnya , fragile nuclear power stations , unpaid soldiers , corruption , gangsters and a president suffering with heart disease on his way to the operating theatre ? '
In this respect , I and other liberals would like to see the following from the European Union : 1.That the Union opens its doors to increased trade , in other words increased imports from Russia of both goods and services .2.That the Union financially supports the creation of Russian institutions which promote diversity , respect for the individual , the environment and economic development .3.That the Union increases exchanges with Russia of students and researchers .4.That the Union facilitates increased cooperation between Russia and its neighbours in Central and Eastern Europe through better coordination of the Phare and Tacis programmes .5.That the Union makes it absolutely clear to Russian leaders that disintegration of Russia is not in the interests of the Union but that we expect that Russian Statesmen shall always respect the rights of minority groups and individuals .6.That the Union , together with Russia and other States involved , works towards a new European order , an order which guarantees freedom and peace for Russia as well .7.That the Union , as a long term goal , keeps an open view on Russian membership of the European Union . What , Commissioner van den Broek , is the Commissions answer to our requests ?
Previously , it has been possible for individual countries to reduce unemployment through their own labour market and economic policies .
This is no longer sufficient as we have seen .
But there is also a new requirement now for action at Community level .
An economic policy is required which prioritises not only the fight against inflation and budget deficits but also the fight against unemployment .
There is currently a committee on economic policy which gives support to Council Finance Ministers in the form of analysis , proposals and evaluation .
In Parliamentary discussions on the budgetary deficit doubts have been expressed about the establishment of a committee on employment and labour market policies .
The committee will follow up national programmes .
The establishment of a committee on employment and labour market policy will naturally not solve unemployment problems in Europe .
For this , an employment committee which has the same status as the monetary committee is required .
The committee will have contact with parties involved in the labour market through cooperation with the Standing Committee on Employment and will naturally have contact with the committee on labour market policy .
One reason why it is so high - there are several - is the EMU.
Next best would have been to introduce criteria into the EMU which also covered goals for employment , the environment and regional responsibility .
Those who believe that the committee will solve the problem of unemployment in the EU are wrong .
Each country must take its own responsibility for unemployment ; responsibility shall remain with the Member States .
So : summarise , produce reports , come forward with ideas and recommendations , but no supranational policies at EU level please .
I , myself , will attempt
