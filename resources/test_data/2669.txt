part of consumer transactions from Europe on the Web is directed at American sites and in future may well be directed at Asian sites .
European business has to keep up and the key to this will be confidence .
We have to aspire to the establishment of the highest quality of e-businesses in Europe .
Companies setting up or changing to this way of doing business have to look carefully at the way they operate , at the information and the service they provide to customers if they are to survive .
We should also take care to provide coherent legislation .
Confidence is essential .
There are many opportunities but what of the threats ?
Only this weekend we have seen in London the down-side of the communications and information revolution that the Web has created by putting elements in society in touch with one another , who have then wrought violence on the streets of London .
This may be extreme but there will be unscrupulous people who will set up scams on the Web.
One bad news story may blow confidence in e-trade for years .
E-commerce is in its early stages .
We need , as legislators , to be watchful , not necessarily interventionist , but wary of implications as the medium grows .
Our rapporteur has given us an extremely good basis .
The ELDR Group will stick to her original 'no-amendment ' line .
Mr President , can I join in the very warm welcome to my colleague , Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi' s approach , and commend her on the drive and persistence with which she has advocated this directive and the approach that we have taken .
It is an indication also of the approach this committee will take on all the subsequent legislation .
I would like to perhaps put a distinctive slant on this legislation .
I am one of the few engineers in Parliament , certainly in the Legal Affairs Committee which is dominated by lawyers , and can put a rather different point of view sometimes .
It seems to me that this piece of legislation can be likened in the technological world to the operating system of the whole legal framework that we are putting in place in the European Union for electronic commerce .
It is this operating system within which a lot of other key legislation will be fitted , such as the copyright and information society and distance selling of financial services .
All of those things were fitted into the overall framework of this directive .
So essentially this is the core principle .
I hesitate to call it the Windows because that produces rather unfortunate competitive issues these days but those of you who are software experts will know what I mean when I use the word " Linux " .
For those of you that are not so technologically enabled , Linux is a competitor to Windows that is owned and updated by the users .
That essentially is what we have here .
We have a system that is going to be operated by the users and the point I want to make this evening in now thinking ahead , because we are confident we are going to get this directive through , is to say to the Commission that we need to have a very comprehensive and a very fast feedback from the users about the problems and issues that they are encountering in using this directive .
Clearly the Internet world is going to be highly suitable for the Commission to set that up .
We want to know about issues where Member Governments have blocked transactions .
We want to know where the directive is being tested in the courts .
We want to know where consumers have had problems and feel that their rights are not protected .
We want to know for some of the special cases which we have not been able to cover this time , like gambling - the effect on national lotteries - pharmaceuticals and books , the real problems that they are having .
All of those I suggest need to be covered by the feedback .
The final point I want to make is about speed .
Mrs Palacio referred in her introduction to Internet years and the speed of approach .
We were challenged by the Commission and by the Council to get this directive through as quickly as possible .
I say to both of them , and in particular to representatives of the Council here , we have risen to that challenge and we now expect Member Governments to behave with the same speed to get this legislation transposed .
We encourage the Commission and the Council to get the remaining bits of that legislation to us as quickly as possible because that is what Europe needs .
Mr President , can I too add my congratulations to the rapporteur .
There can be no doubt that the job of the Parliament tomorrow is without further ado to vote through the report unanimously .
Commission , Parliament and Council have had ample time to discuss and debate at both first and second reading and , as the rapporteur said , most of Parliament ' s views now feature in the Council common position .
It is therefore a balanced proposal .
Let us remind ourselves that the Lisbon special EU Summit in March set us new targets and deadlines to make better use of the Internet , strengthening Europe ' s competitiveness in the knowledge economy .
This therefore means we need to create a clear and simple , predictable and consistent legal framework for electronic commerce .
It is now an economic and political imperative .
The directive will go a significant way towards creating the framework which is necessary to provide the confidence that both business and consumers desire to maximise the potential of e-business
