These considerations come into play as regards the significant technological change that the switchover to digital represents .
In the new accession countries faced with these decommissioning requirements , as in the case before us , we feel it is right that they should receive the support they need to carry this out in the proper manner , from the point of view of human and environmental safety .     .
Ahead of the forthcoming Conference of Parties in Montreal between 28 November and 9 December , Parliament is emphasising the need to give the highest priority to talks on emission reduction commitments for the period after 2012 arising from the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , which entered into force on 16 February 2005 , having been ratified by 152 countries and regional organisations .
Mr Wijkman’s excellent report puts forward a number of measures to help solve the problem of climate change around the world .
Lastly , a strategy must be developed to turn Europe into the most energy-efficient economy in the world .
Secondly , developed societies are not prepared to accept a lower standard of living , and nor should this be our policy or our blueprint .
As competition is seen as the be-all-and-end-all , precedence is always given to measures aimed at creating competition between workers in order to try to drive salaries and other social benefits further and further down .
This is a trend that must be reversed .     – According to a recent US Congress report , arms contracts to developing countries signed by the four main European exporters in 2004 totalled just under USD 5 billion .
Along with the Commissioner , we welcome the Council’s decision to fight for a proper universal Treaty at the UN containing common rules on the global armaments trade .
This is essential if we are to ensure the survival of a sector that makes a significant contribution to the Lisbon Strategy , to technological innovation and to the Union’s strategic autonomy .
This is all the more serious when , in addition to other countries , non-state actors or terrorists seek to get their hands on illegal weaponry .     – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , the safety of workers and citizens must be guaranteed in defence manufacturing processes , and the companies themselves must operate as efficiently as possible .
Clear and transparent rules on defence procurement can help a great deal in this regard .
This vote is the final step in a long process of negotiation , which has been characterised by huge pressure , mainly on the part of the powerful chemical industry .
This would actually make it far more damaging than the current legislation , if public health and safety are not safeguarded .     .
Although I was pleased with the final result of the vote , I must point out that I object to the inclusion of substances in tobacco products , as they are already covered by their own legislation .     .
In light of the amendments introduced , I opted to vote in favour , not least because there will be further opportunities to introduce any necessary corrections , as in the section on authorisation .     .
The Commission ’s proposal is a follow-up to the International Agreement on Humane Trapping concluded between the EU , the USA , Canada and Russia .
My opinion has been and continues to be that the EU must persevere with its embargo because it is , more than anything , a stand taken by the 25 Member States in defence of human rights , the international order and peace .
We feel that while the resolution makes some positive points , it also contains some very worrying ones .
We cannot be resolute in our remarks , but indecisive when it comes to taking action .
The report addresses one of its fundamental pillars , namely the development of the military industry in the various Member States .
To this end , it calls on the ( ‘large’ ) Member States and the large armaments firms to set aside their differences , arguing that steps should be taken to ensure that ‘defence procurement is covered to a larger extent by European Community legislation rather than by national legislation ’ and that ‘a restrictive interpretation of national security interests is appropriate’ .
Of the many aspects that I could highlight , there is one that warrants particular focus .
With its biased view of the Middle East situation , the resolution makes proposals that would only serve to intensify the conflict .
The ambitions that he expresses – or rather , those laid down in the negotiating mandate – are identical to those that the captains of industry trotted out yet again in their statement of 21 November , which called for greater liberalisation in agriculture and in access to the market for industrial products and services , and offered guarantees that the round of talks will be concluded by the end of 2006 .
It is crucial , bearing in mind the potential consequences of an epidemic , that preventative action be taken effectively and promptly – albeit without causing public alarm – both here in the EU and in third countries , in particular Asian ones .
Secondly , greater Community support is needed to develop research into an oral vaccine to combat the various strains and to promote the use thereof should the need arise ; the total cost of vaccines should be borne by the Community .
I believe , however , that in this case it is right to increase Community assistance to 60 % , in line with my proposal , because if a Member State faces a situation of this nature having taken the necessary prevention measures , it deserves solidarity from the Community , and this may
