( SV ) Unfortunately , the European Parliament ' s Committee on Constitutional Affairs has not taken on board anything of what has happened in the European Union in recent years .
It is interesting to note that , on the night of the EMU referendum last month , the Danish Social Democrats were exultant when the votes from the upper class areas had been counted and disappointed when they saw how people in working-class areas had voted .
At present , this principle is merely a tool for the EU itself , for it is at present at EU level that it is decided where the political decisions are to be made , with the result that the EU is claiming policy area after policy area for itself .
What is more , there is a need to simplify the flexibility rules so that they do more to facilitate European cooperation in accordance with the wishes of the people of Europe .
I abstained from voting in the final vote .
The Swedish Christian Democrats do not believe that the Convention has proved to be a democratic or effective method of working when it comes to producing a Charter of Fundamental Rights .
If , in a future EU with 25 to 30 Member States , the situation is to be avoided of a Europe Ã  la carte in which the unity of the Member States is in danger of disintegrating , we nonetheless believe that at least half of all Member States must participate in flexible integration .
The EU must acquire a credible foreign policy .
It is therefore important to retain the transatlantic link , even if there might , of course , be better coordination and a better distribution of labour .
I abstained from voting in the final vote .
Sudre report ( A5-0285/2000 )
As has also been said by other MEPs in this Chamber - most of whom have been Italian , though I do not believe that that is really significant , given the disgust we all feel - it is an unworthy punishment : a punishment unworthy of a civilised society , which always involves a risk of innocent people being convicted .
There have been legal doubts concerning a number of the cases , and there have also been a number of cases concerning children .
I wish vigorously to support the proposal of my fellow MEP , Mr Rutelli , for a European day of opposition to the death penalty during our Presidency .
It is not as simple as that , however .
Life will have changed out of recognition , and it will scarcely be very pleasant either .
It has been characterised by considerable unity , which is a good foundation to have now that the conference in The Hague is beginning .
I think the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy has given a clear message that we do not consider three representatives from the European Parliament at the conference in The Hague to be sufficient .
It is important that MEPs ' viewpoints should also be taken on board so that it is not just a case of one-way communication .
There must also be legally binding measures obliging the Member States to comply with their quotas .
Many have had doubts about the proposal for emissions trading , especially when it comes to the socio-economic consequences .
Only half of the amendment published in the Swedish document has been adopted .
This is a welcome document .
This is not , of course , because we do not know what changes are required , but because the necessary changes would have such massive repercussions upon the whole of our transport and energy policy and , in point of fact , upon our whole method of consuming .
A responsible policy on the part of the most developed countries must be based upon those countries ' being able to reduce their own emissions .
If there is to be a place for emissions trading , which is something I am very doubtful about , the latter should only constitute a minor part of the policy as a whole , in which case any such trading must also be strictly controlled , with consideration given to the social dimension and to the opportunities for developing countries to make further progress in the future .
Emissions and abatements trading are no substitute for the real changes required .
Where tax is concerned , a common minimum tax is to be desired .
I believe that the EU must take the lead in the work being done internationally on climate change .
I have seen again and again during the last few months the unsystematic way in which energy policy is conducted within the European Union .
A few months later , we complain that the lower prices have reduced the incentives in favour of energy efficiency and renewable energy sources .
It is , in any case , in the developing countries that most investment in energy production will take place in the future .
First of all , however , I want to round off the discussion about what we believe must happen in The Hague in a few weeks ' time by saying that our role must clearly be that of instigating change internationally .
What we are concerned with here , of course , are methods and systems of transport , which must be equipped for the future .
We also need , of course , to discuss new areas and the integration of environmental and climate considerations into all policy areas .
Again , it is a question of credibility .
This problem must not , however , be used as a reason for not taking action but may even perhaps be turned to our advantage as something which strengthens competitiveness and offers us benefits .
The natural catastrophes which have
