The Union , as an association , is unique in that it is not a state .
It would be a mistake to change the Union into a military alliance .
A common policy on the arms industry would be liable to increase pressures to export arms even to countries which use them against their own people .
I have today also signed a statement by some of my Nordic colleagues condemning the conversion of the Union into a military alliance .
The economic efficiency of nuclear power has been proved beyond doubt .
At present the proportion of nuclear power in the EU 's electricity production is one-third , and it cannot be rapidly replaced by other forms of energy .
Compared with traditional means of energy production the overwhelming advantage of nuclear power is its compatibility with the environment , since it does not pollute the air with carbon dioxide which accelerates the greenhouse effect .
Member States must respect the decisions of other Member States .
From a safety point of view the EU must use its know-how and expertise to help the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and of the CIS in solving their nuclear safety problems .
The nuclear industry must always be monitored comprehensively from production to the final storage and destruction of nuclear waste .
Decisions must be taken on the final storage places for highly active , because it is not right that waste should have to be kept in temporary storage .
I do not know what is being voted upon here .
I shall therefore withdraw from any vote in connection with the debate on this report .
I should however like to point out that this is a very significant issue , a major issue of principle and a very important issue .
I myself am quite new here , and it is quite impossible for me to follow what was going on and longer .
I am not going to vote simply solely according to what is on the voting list .
So there is no reason for the EU to develop a common defence industry as this report proposes .
To refer to some sort of ' European identity ' for security and defence is not credible as the various Member States have different foundations for their security policies .
To justify this , as it says in the report , by saying that it would give increased credibility within Nato is not relevant from a nonaligned perspective .
So we have rejected the proposal and voted against the report .
However , the objective of the report to increase the proportion generally throughout the EU is justified .
In spite of its achievements , the report has one shortcoming .
It fails to refer to peat as a renewable source of energy .
Peat bogs grow peat at the same rate annually as forests grow wood .
These documents have highlighted many important points .
Reference is also quite rightly made to the problems which have arisen in view of the administrative bureaucracy and lack of internal coordination among the Commission 's units .
In order to simplify and promote the activities of the structural funds it is absolutely essential to simplify the administrative procedure and develop the internal coordination of the Commission 's units .
In applying regional policy stress has been placed on the participation of regional and local authorities and interest groups in the planning and realization of regional policy .
This practice has increased the bureaucracy involved in distributing the resources and resulted in the central government 's own objectives being given priority over regional objectives .
In spite of the problems it must be stressed that the activities of the structural funds have clearly brought new energy and enthusiasm into regional activities .
Mr President , I should like to thank Mr Rack for his thorough and effective work in assessing regional policy in the three new Member States .
It is of course the central principle of the EU 's regional policy to narrow the differences between the regions .
Even in the new Member States it is noticeable that the differences between the regions are growing rather than shrinking .
In the Objective 6 area account is taken of the distinctive features typical of the Nordic countries such as low population density and long distances .
There are some areas in which two-thirds of the resources are directed towards farms and only one third remains for the structural development of the region .
We have a reasonably good administrative culture and the EU 's structural programmes have involved increased bureaucracy .
This problem is described very well and it is to be hoped that we will get over this problem in the review of the regional policy programmes .
Unfortunately it seems that greater effectiveness in regional policy is the most positive thing which EU membership has brought , to Finland at least .
For example , at our last part-session , we transferred over one and a half billion ECU in unutilized appropriations to the end of the programming period .
The rapporteur quite rightly refers to the delays in adopting the Community initiatives , but at the same time he could also have referred to the slowness in dealing with the objective programmes .
Thus the call made in the report for greater transparency in the administration of the structural funds is quite justified .
The report also quite rightly draws attention to the Member States 's internal administrations and stresses both the subsidiarity principle and the 'bottom up ' approach .
The central administration is endeavouring , just as Mrs Ojala and Mrs Ryyn√§nen have said , to arrogate the decision-making power to itself unncessarily .
Furthermore , there is also 'local cooperation group' , founded on the administration of the structural funds which forms a second , unnecessary and bureaucratic organization alongside the democratic local authority administration .
In the Objective
