Have they received any representations from United Kingdom ministers ?
Can the Commissioner say when an opportunity for revising the directive to introduce these exceptions - supposing Parliament would ever agree to them - might arise , and does it feel that such an exception for animal waste and for the burning of empty pesticide containers in on-farm incinerators would in fact be likely to gain acceptance ?
I have given the Commissioner notice of these questions .
Mr President , I should like to make two brief points which may well be relevant should this go to conciliation , as I suspect it will .
The first is the impact of this directive on the existing specialist toxic waste incineration industry .
These incinerators have to adhere to higher standards than the coincineration plants .
My concern is that the high calorific value waste will be cherry-picked for coincineration and this in turn will push up the cost of the specialist toxic waste incinerators which will mean that they will have to actually buy in fuel in many instances to achieve the high temperatures which are required to destroy things like dioxin .
We need the specialist toxic waste incinerators .
There are only three at the moment in the United Kingdom .
If we had fewer of these plants , it would mean that hazardous waste might well have to be transported for large distances , which is not acceptable for both political and practical environment reasons , and it would also push up the cost of incinerating this toxic waste .
The second point I would make is to underline the point made by Dr Jackson .
I come from a region in the United Kingdom with the highest density of pigs .
Now traditionally fallen stock has been disposed of by burial on the farm , but with these very large units this is just not a practical way of disposal , so many of the units have installed their own incinerators - small incinerators using less than 50 kg per hour .
If these incinerators are not used , people may well have to go back to burial .
I think this mix-up has been due to a misunderstanding between the Department of the Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture in Britain , who thought there were only sixty incinerators of this type when in fact there are several thousand .
This problem also applies to hunt kennels which feed fallen stock , and dispose of offal and - bizarrely - to pet crematoria , although I understand that human crematoria are not covered as dead people are not classified as waste .
In conciliation could I ask you to make allowance for these farmers who have invested in cleaning up the environment by installing incinerators , and for whom the cost would be excessive should they not be able to continue .
My understanding from the interpretation was that the incineration of dead animals is not covered by this directive under the terms of Article 2( 2 ) .
I am looking at Article 2( 2 ) and I cannot see that exclusion set out there .
It talks about vegetable waste and vegetable waste does not cover dead animals .
However , I will get clarification from the Commissioner personally .
Mr President , given the importance of the directive on national emission ceilings to this report on a proposal for a daughter directive , it is a little surprising that the order of debate is as it is , because without reduction in the key trans-boundary pollutants we are not going to reduce ozone .
This report sets national targets for ozone levels and proposes action plans for dealing with local problems of exceedance .
To save time I am going to assume that the respiratory and other health problems associated with ozone are understood , and that every Member of this House will want to reduce them .
The disputes between us will be about costs and time-scales , and perhaps also about the accuracy of the Commission 's methodology and the achievability of the targets it has set in this directive .
Let me deal directly with the Commission 's core proposal , the setting of a target for 2010 of 120 mg per cubic metre for ozone , not to be exceeded on more than 20 days per year .
Commission proposals for environmental improvements need to be both ambitious and realistic .
These proposals are certainly ambitious but many governments dispute whether they are politically realistic , and having just come from a difficult - albeit ultimately successful - group meeting of my own , I know that many Members have doubts .
In particular , representatives of the Mediterranean countries point out problems resulting from the strong sunlight they enjoy .
I point out that the Commission 's methodology has taken full account of this but I look at their faces and still see a degree of scepticism .
I did wonder some months ago whether to table amendments , which would suggest a less ambitious outcome , but which would perhaps be more acceptable to Member States .
But the Commission 's 120 mg target is in line with World Health Organisation proposals , and who am I to suggest that they should be challenged ?
The number of days of exceedance could easily be adjusted , but that is something to negotiate only when necessary .
It is a good target and , if it is at all possible , then it should be retained .
The position I have taken in preparing this report is to say that those who want tougher targets than the Commission has proposed should have their views rejected .
But equally it would be wrong for us to water down the draft directive .
That is why I am sorry to see amendments tabled which reflect
