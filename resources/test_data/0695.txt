' s preparations for the Nice European Council .
Some countries still have major problems regarding the coordination of social security systems , tax , asylum , visa and immigration matters and trade negotiations on services - a very important issue .
Progress has also been made on increasing the powers of the President of the Commission and a possible increase in the number of Vice-Presidents .
I want to be as objective as possible about the situation before this very important Council .
At the General Affairs Council of 20 November we had a very good debate based on the excellent documents the Commission had forwarded to the Council .
Similarly , employment guidelines are to be forwarded to the European Council together with an Autumn 2000 employment package .
So you can see that I am certainly not exaggerating when I say we have an important agenda and a very full agenda for the Nice Council .
The Presidency wanted to restate the basic principles governing the Community ' s approach in this area , including primarily the freedom of Member States to define and organise their own public services while respecting the rules of the Treaty .
Trade talks have already been communitised , but if the Commission is indeed speaking with a single voice , then this voice is not sufficiently controlled by the Member States .
We do not find the principle of blackmailing into proclamation acceptable with regard to the conclusions the Biarritz European Council , even if it was an informal one .
It is even in the interests of agriculture , at a time when health and the environment are areas covered by codecision .
So my third question is this : how is this business going to be managed ?
Since we are talking about Turkey , however , I should like to point out that a Member of Parliament from my group , Mrs Uca , was representing my group until yesterday at the congress of one of Turkey ' s Kurdish parties , HADEP.
First of all , in the field of foreign and security policy , I shall assess the main institutional developments and more specifically issues relating to the European defence system and Mr Alain Richard , Minister for Defence , will speak in greater detail about all the aspects to do with military capabilities .
These relationships will , in particular , take the form of meetings between the North Atlantic Council and the iPSC and of meetings between the European Union and the fifteen European candidate and/or ally countries .
I now wish to say a few words about the new instruments established by the Treaty of Amsterdam and about interinstitutional relations , which are both subjects on which , I noted , your reports expressed some concern .
Democracy did win the day , after all the ups and downs , with which we are all familiar .
Our policy is quite clear : we want , on the basis of principles of democracy , human rights , the rule of law and the market economy , to provide the most useful incentives and support for the huge changes undertaken by Russia , for it to become , eventually - and it will take as long as necessary - a great country , which is developing , which is modernising at every level and which is peace-loving , in short , the kind of country that we would be happy to have as our neighbour .
To this figure we can add the loans that the EIB has planned to set aside , making a total of around EUR 13 billion .
This is moreover the case at this very moment .
This is a specific point , Mr President but a specific question was asked , and so I wished to provide this type of answer .
Firstly , we have the catalogue of capabilities , a 300-page document which scrupulously lists all the military capabilities that are known to be needed by our Union in order to guarantee that all of the Petersberg tasks can be fulfilled .
We gave a particular commitment , under the current reforms of our armed forces , referred to just now by Mrs Lalumi√®re , to continuing to increase our own capabilities and to coordinating existing projects , implementing national or multinational solutions to improve the performance of our forces .
As you see , Europeans are bent on undertaking a sustained effort in order to give credibility to a European defence system .
Since the fall of Talokan in September , which led to our Parliament 's first resolution and has triggered today 's debate , the situation has continued to worsen , especially in humanitarian terms .
Here Mr Brok rightly deplores , and I quote , " the persistent inability of the Union to play a constructive role " , and in this case the responsibility does not lie with the French Presidency .
We did so immediately , on the spot .
Let me start with the question of the position of defence capabilities within the European Union 's spectrum of political and practical instruments .
It relates to the Petersberg tasks .
I believe we will see a positive dialogue developing .
Given the scale of the task , four committees were involved and a hitherto unknown procedure was applied , in the form of four parallel reports .
Moreover , over and above all other considerations , we will be even more careful in future to ensure that the Commission really does spend the adopted budget on implementing the various political priorities our Parliament has democratically decided , rather than reallocating it on the basis of functional weaknesses .
We will make sure that all the technical provisions can be implemented on the basis of full respect for Parliament 's rights as an arm of the budgetary authority
