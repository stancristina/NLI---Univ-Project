face of this worrying picture , there are a further two elements which , I think , add to our concerns .
First , an observatory needs to be set up on our part so that we can monitor third country subsidies and report them both to the World Trade Organisation and wherever else necessary .
Other proposals can also be adopted , but the most important thing is for us to agree on the objective and , fourthly , given that this sector is important for employment , I think that the European Union should use European Commission programmes to help reinforce the sector .
Mr President , I warmly recommend voting in favour of the excellent Leinen report .
Again , my warmest thanks to Mr Leinen , as well as to Mrs Schleicher and Mr Corbett for their courteous reference to my somewhat older contributions .
Besides , the compromise amendments submitted resolve any problems there may be .
In the field of the European political parties , the principle of solidarity between peoples at social level will be implemented via the substantial political rally of the national parties of the Member States .
The role of the European citizen will no longer finish when he votes in elections to the European Parliament ; it will extend to his mobilisation within the framework of the European political parties .
Only with the institution of the European political parties can the process of unification in Europe finally become our affair , by which I mean the affair of the European citizens .
Yet again we note , as does the report , the failure of the EU 's regional policy and the lack of prospects for its future application , especially in the weaker countries following enlargement .
In other words , we are robbing Peter to pay Paul !
( EL ) The report being debated has no administrative character , it has a purely political character .
It opts for constant and institutionalised intervention in the Member States , in order to restrict the voice and action of the political forces which have an anti-imperialist , anti-capitalist character and are fighting the ?U.
For these reasons , the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report and called for it to be withdrawn .
In other words , the aim is to consolidate the stock exchange as a mechanism for concentrating capital and safeguarding a quick , easy profit for monopoly groups .
So far , not only have no substantial control measures been taken , but also recent repeated scandals have revealed that even these very control mechanisms have advocated cheating by adopting creative accounting methods , and as a result the savings of the working classes , the capital of small investors and pension funds have grown wings and flown into the coffers of the monopoly groups , which grow rich in this parasitical manner .
It is not possible for the European Union to be indifferent to such commitments by the Member States in public contracts , when the quality of employment relations and , more generally , the quality of life is now a generally recognised aim of all its policies .
We would also stress that it is not enough to refer to social and environmental criteria in the preamble , they must also be included in the regulatory text of the directive .
I believe that , because of these events , Europe has grown up over these six months .
Events have allowed it to see its weaknesses , such as the crisis in Iraq , but they have also allowed it to see its strong points .
It is highly illustrative that the Convention completed its work on the draft constitution and that this draft constitution was accepted by the Convention by a large majority .
A six-month period , as I said , of unexpected events .
We have realised that we must take decisions as quickly as possible .
Secondly , to speed up the implementation of the Lisbon strategy .
The ceremony for the signing of the Accession Treaty by the 10 candidate countries , which set the seal on enlargement , was a ceremony which marked one of the most important events in the development of Europe .
I should like to comment on the integration of Cyprus , which joined together with the other nine countries and constitutes the justification of the fight for political restoration , for the restoration of the principles of international law .
We advanced numerous chapters in the negotiations with these countries .
We shall now have economic policy guidelines for three years and this is , I believe , important so that we can plan better .
The agreement on tax arrangements in relation to tax evasion had been discussed for a very long time in the Council without our coming to any conclusion and I am glad that we managed to overcome the problems under the Greek Presidency , problems which also arose because certain countries felt , and still feel , that they should try to make special arrangements of their own on such basic issues .
I think that the adoption of the Small Business Charter , the decisions to improve the regulatory framework and the agreements on integrating the European stock exchanges were important .
Ladies and gentlemen , that brings me to the third subject , the Convention on the Future of Europe .
We discussed in Thessaloniki whether this draft is a draft for starting negotiations at the Intergovernmental Conference and whether it is a good basis for discussion .
We must not start discussing everything from square one at the Intergovernmental Conference , nor must we focus on one issue or another and fail to reach a solution which has politically predefined margins , as referred to in the decision taken in Halkidiki .
