policies in the context of their individual foreign policies .
If we do not establish improved mechanisms to ensure coherence between national policies , it will certainly be more difficult to deliberate against a background of greater coherence in European Union development policy .
So without a more active role for the Development Council in the overall coordination of political decision making which , although it directly impacts on the European Union ' s development policy , is largely being dealt with outside this decision-making forum , it will certainly be difficult to establish a more coherent European Union policy on development objectives .
The Tenth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development is being held right now in Bangkok , and is suffering the consequences of that failure .
Furthermore , the recent Community budget cuts in this area , for the present financial year , are part of this trend , as well as sending an undesirable and misguided political message .
It is therefore essential to review the present process of globalisation , bearing in mind the underlying approach and dominant interests on which it is based , and to consider the enormous and damaging effect that it is having on the less developed countries , particularly in this context .
But it was above all the result of a stronger ACP group , which obviously found new courage following the events in Seattle .
In my opinion , these contradictions are not all that serious in terms of Community policies .
That is a fact of life .
I have left to the end a question that I regard as fundamental and which I think needs to be noted and approved by this House .
( PT ) Mr President , by way of both a conclusion and a summary , I would like to highlight three key aspects of this debate .
I note that some speakers also emphasised that responsibility for coherence in EU policies is not a matter for the Council , for the Commission or for Parliament alone .
The European Union will continue discussions on preparations for the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission at the next meeting of the Human Rights Group in March .
The European Union voted against that motion .
It is in the interests of the European Union to keep all its options open for as long as possible , and in any case at least until after the EU-China human rights dialogue meeting is held on 25 February 2000 .
The next human rights dialogue will take place on 25 February in Lisbon , and will include seminars on legal issues and on women ' s rights , and it is expected that representatives from the academic world and from civil society will take part .
Discussions within the European Union about the situation in China following the outcome of the dialogue rounds in 1999 have led the European Union to decide to express its concern about human rights violations in China more firmly ; the same applies to the absence of concrete outcomes from the dialogue , while recognising the positive steps that China has made on the international stage .
The European Union will oppose any spurious attempt to use this reform of the Human Rights Commission ' s activities to limit its capacity for intervention by restricting its sphere of influence and its ongoing monitoring of all human rights issues at world level .
The use of biotechnology needs to be studied in greater depth and not just "packaged " for immediate sale to boost the profits of a few multinationals in this sector .
Stenzel report ( A5-0034/2000 )
This is a great deal to build on such fragile foundations .
We all know that water is a commodity without which mankind cannot live and that it is imperative that its quality should be preserved .
But it is not just a question of preventing or putting a stop to sickening instances of aggression perpetrated by individuals or institutions against those in a weaker position .
Someone must be held to account for the events that took place there , some of which I saw with my own eyes as a representative of this House ; they cannot go unpunished .
Our experience of previous sessions of the Human Rights Commission suggests - precisely by virtue of this coordinating role played by successive presidencies - that the European Union is very much able to uphold its status as a body with its own policy within the Commission , and it is important to maintain this .
I would simply like to say that the Portuguese Presidency has , in these two short months , organised the first Development Council , admittedly an informal one , whose agenda was rightly dominated by EU-Africa relations .
I think it will be obvious to everyone that the events in Helsinki at the end of last year and the new era in relations between the European Union and Turkey have created a new backdrop , at Community level , which we cannot ignore when it comes to relations between the two Cypriot communities .
However , agreement has also been reached on the possibility of including other issues , and the representative of the northern part of the island , Rauf Denktash , has suggested three new topics : sovereignty , confidence-building measures and the issue of lifting the embargo on products from the north of the island .
This will take place after the election in the north of the island scheduled for 18 April .
There is also another important aspect which I referred to at the beginning of my statement , and this relates to Turkey ' s role in helping the north of the island to prepare for accession .
This would not , let me make this quite clear , imply any kind of formal recognition
