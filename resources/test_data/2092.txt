The outcome of the vote in Parliament tomorrow is likely to bring a few shocks and surprises .
But it should mean that in six months ' time the European Parliament , the Council of Ministers and the Commission will have arrived at an agreed proposal , at a revised directive for the commercialisation of biotechnological inventions and biotechnological products .
That should give biotechnology companies and others involved in the industry a clear idea of the rules that they have adhere to and consequently a more transparent and predictable regime .
That can be only good for the future development of this new technology within the European Union .
At the same time , I would hope that our governments will be able to assure their consumers and their people that GMOs released into the environment anywhere in Europe will meet the much more stringent standards that we are fixing here in Parliament tomorrow and that the public concerns regarding the protection of human health and the environment from the dangers of GMO inventions have been properly addressed .
And I hope one of the significant non-legislative outcomes of this process will be a shift in the balance of power in the approval and control of GMO crops and food in favour of the public .
For the biotechnology industry that can only be to the good .
It will create an atmosphere , a situation in which it can work carefully , thoroughly and I hope successfully to make positive use of this very brave new technology that we should all welcome , with the appropriate safeguards .
Mr President , this is a debate about plant research and plant protection from research .
It is a debate about the potential of GMOs for good and their potential for risk , and how you manage that risk .
You cannot abolish risk because it is part of our natural environment .
We cannot prevent all man-made risk because that would end scientific progress .
But we must respond to public concern about the potential and unknown dangers to our environment , to our food chain and to our health .
I believe there are four areas where we must act to reassure the public .
I believe we can do so without destroying biotechnology .
Firstly , antibiotic-resistant genes must be phased out .
The amendment sets a realistic , but urgent date of 2005 for that .
Secondly , we must be open with the public about where experimental crops are being grown .
That is only right .
It is fair .
In return we must ask environmental action groups to show restraint and responsibility with regard to that knowledge .
Thirdly , we must build on the Montreal Protocol as far as the export of GMOs is concerned , and this should be done on the basis of mutual agreement and transparency .
Fourthly , as many Members have said , we must ensure liability ; but it is a question of whether we need any greater liability than applies to other environmental risks .
I suspect we do not , so long as we already have criminal , civil , product and environmental liability in law .
That should suffice , but it is wise to add the provision on negligence as something which can be brought into play within the courts .
We can gain real benefits from GMOs if we get it right .
Fewer crop sprays , for example , would benefit the environment if we grew GMO crops that did not need so many crop sprays .
But we have to take the public with us , with the science .
I believe these measures will help to do just that .
Mr President , I would urge colleagues to strengthen this report by insisting on environmental liability .
Producers of GMOs should be required to take out insurance against any damage to human health or to the environment from the release of their products .
The Commission promised the introduction of horizontal legislation over ten years ago .
But even though we now have a White Paper , the actual legislation is some years away .
This means that , if it is not accepted into this directive , the victims will have to pay for any damage instead of the companies that are making the profits .
Thousands of people across Europe have chosen not to buy products containing GMOs because of the evidence of health and environmental damage .
We must address those very real issues .
I would urge colleagues to accept my group 's amendments on liability insurance , GMO contamination and the ban on antibiotic-resistant genes .
Consumers are demanding the strictest controls and will be satisfied by nothing less .
It is vital that all the necessary safeguards are now included in this directive .
Mr President , beef labelling has two distinct functions .
Firstly , traceability in the case of a food safety incident - the recent E. coli outbreak in Scotland for example - and , secondly , to give consumers information about the origin of beef at the point of sale .
The two should not be confused .
For traceability we need maximum information made available to the authorities as and when required but the consumer label should be simple , concise and unambiguous .
The need for information sprang from the BSE crisis .
Member States have differing levels of BSE incidence but there are also variations in the measures to eradicate the disease and protect human health .
Although the United Kingdom has the highest incidence of BSE , it also has the most comprehensive control measures .
Other countries , which admittedly have lower declared levels of BSE , operate a whole-herd slaughter policy which entails the risk of the under-reporting of cases .
Therefore people want to know which country their beef comes from .
Reference to regions should not be
