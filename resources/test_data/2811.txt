not intend to take emergency measures at this stage , but will continue its investigations into the circumstances leading to Nguema 's death .
The Council will of course use all available means to find the truth .
I myself have been present here in Parliament to debate resolutions on that unfortunate country , and I can assure the House that the Council has every intention of finding the truth .
I fully agree with my former colleague and thank him for the tragic , and regrettable , news that another death has taken place .
It has done its best with the means at its disposal .
I can say no more .
That is a distortion of the truth .
In the same breath as citizens ' rights are defined as ' European rights' , taking precedence over rights based on national legislation , in precisely the same breath , national citizenship is undermined .
European citizenship is purely and simply integration through the back door .
What is being proposed is the absorption of vital parts of countries ' legal systems , including criminal law and the police , into European citizenship .
' There is something rotten' - not in Denmark , but in the European Union .
I think it important that the developing countries in particular be protected against the harmful effects of what is often the aggressive marketing of GMOs , with their possible serious consequences for people 's health , especially if we wish to conserve biological diversity in the countries concerned .
In this context , I shall just highlight the essential features .
Secondly , it is important for the precautionary principle to be established .
In relation particularly to the developing countries , it is absolutely crucial that doubts about the harmful effects on biological diversity in the countries concerned should really be taken seriously , and it is also crucial that the legislation apply both to GMOs released into the environment and to genetically modified food and animal feed .
Finally , I think that Mr Sjöstedt is right to emphasise , and table proposals about , the fact that it is not enough for exporters to give notice of movements of GMOs .
I think that this should apply to all movements , and not only the first , since the recipient country should have the opportunity to monitor the spread of GMO products in its territory .
Finally , I would add that it is very important for the EU countries to apply tough and uniform sanctions so as to avoid a situation in which certain countries visibly get away , or almost get away , with disregarding the legislation while others do not .
I think that by adopting Mr Sjöstedt 's report and a number of the amendments tabled also on Mr Sjöstedt 's initiative , we shall see the Cartagena Protocol implemented fairly and consistently .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as President of the Council , I am delighted to have been given the opportunity to attend this debate , in which Commission representatives are taking part , on the European Parliament 's 2003 budget .
I again have the pleasure today of meeting Mr Wynn and the two rapporteurs for the 2003 budget , Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck .
I also wish to take the opportunity of thanking the Budget Commissioner , Mrs Schreyer , and the other Commissioners for their really helpful cooperation .
There is no doubt that the EU 's 2003 budget is a major challenge .
The EU is to take up quite a few new tasks next year .
The EU institutions are to prepare themselves for enlargement , and the EU is to assume responsibility for the UN police force in Bosnia-Herzegovina .
For that reason , the budget procedure has until now also been characterised by a desire to find practical solutions and reach compromises .
I want to conclude by wishing the Members of the European Parliament , together with the Commissioners , a constructive debate .
Thank you , Mr President .
I was involved in putting Parliament 's house in order following its scandalous dealings with taxpayers ' money which have left us with the still unfinished business surrounding the issue of reimbursed travel expenses .
I was involved in dismissing the last Commission , and I have always been very critical of the lack of transparency in the Commission .
Not by any stretch of the imagination did I , however , at any time think that the Commission did its accounts on an Excel spreadsheet so that the figures could be adjusted without anyone 's knowing .
If the owner of an ice-cream stall or hardware shop were to do his accounts in the same way , it would be unlawful and lead to legal action by the tax office .
There is a desire to shoot the messenger for bringing bad news .
Mrs Andreasen initially went through the internal channels and passed her observations up the line to Mr Prodi , but to no avail so far as I understand .
Since 1994 , the Court of Auditors has refused to vouch for the correctness of the underlying transactions .
The Commission 's current practice of accounting on spreadsheets lends itself to poor administration and fraud .
We should together discuss how we can deal with what , to me , looks like the worst scandal in the EU 's history .
From now on , we all share the responsibility .
Thank you , Mr President and Mr Pedersen .
On behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , I must express our concerns regarding the implementation of the budget for the European Social Fund .
In this area too , moreover , we see the build-up of outstanding commitments , something which we regard as a problem
