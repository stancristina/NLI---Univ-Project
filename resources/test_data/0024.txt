Resolution 1441 is crystal clear on that point .
If Doctor Blix and his colleagues need more time , they must be given it .
The UN needs our support at this difficult time .
Perhaps it is too late , but it is the last chance for the EU to re-establish its rather tarnished reputation .
Good luck !
Firstly , I want to say that I have nothing against those parts relating to forest fires and air pollution , for these are phenomena that are not confined within boundaries and that affect all countries in the same way .
What is more , no one can now say what is meant by biodiversity in a European perspective .
Were it to be deemed under the policy that the biodiversity on a particular piece of land or in a particular area was so important that it needed to be conserved for the future - certain islands were mentioned just recently in this context - who would then compensate whoever was forfeiting his or her asset ?
Madam President , this report concerns the prevention and reduction of risks associated with drug dependence .
Such efforts must , however , form part of a coherent strategy aimed at bringing about lasting change and lives not dependent upon illegal and other drugs .
These are proposals that we cannot under any circumstances support .
This survey shows that 92 out of every 100 pupils in Swedish schools have not even tried drugs .
Listening to our fellow MEP , Mr Davies is extremely depressing .
In this Chamber too , voices in favour of legalising and liberalising drugs and classifying them as dangerous and less dangerous are being heard more and more often .
The overall tenor of Mrs Malliori 's report is , unfortunately , along those lines , even though certain parts of it are constructive , for example the demand for drugs-free prisons .
The objective , which has to remain in place , must be a drugs-free society .
We Swedish Liberals will vote against the report because it lacks this overall combination .
It is an area that touches upon many aspects of health and consumer policy .
The weekly magazines fuel this trend by showing 'before and after ' pictures .
What I think is the most important part of the proposal is the '18 years ' old ' limit whereby non-medical implants are to be prohibited in the case of girls under 18 years of age .
I am very satisfied with the report .
Politicians and authorities must therefore emphasise clearly that every form of drug dependence is unacceptable .
The report does not comply with the guidelines in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity .
In practice , this is a revamping of the earlier key ideological term used by those with a liberal approach to drugs , namely 'harm reduction' , which has fallen into disrepute for understandable reasons .
Drug abuse in institutions would then be legitimised .
For both criminals and the general public , a softening of the penalties would mean sending out the wrong message , that society takes a less serious view of drug crime .
At the same time , we are convinced that this can be done other than through privacy-invading , compulsory registration , which is a measure we do not believe to be in accordance with our approach to politics .
What is more , certain parts of the report concern patient issues , which do not come within the EU 's area of competence .
Better than having registers to sanction breast implants as a natural medical activity would be to follow the recommendation made to the Member States in item 19 and , as France has done , prohibit direct advertisements for breast implants .
On the basis of that approach , we chose to vote against those items concerned with incorporating the prevention of forest fires into the regulation .
We did so in view of the fact that Parliament had included important wordings concerning the principle of subsidiarity and the importance of the Member States ' participating in the work on developing this regulation .
The concept of 'reproductive and sexual health and rights ' would then have been clearly defined , in terms of the protection of the unborn child , by means of the following wording : ' In the context of this Regulation , abortion , which can never be promoted as a family planning method , cannot be considered as a service which guarantees sexual and reproductive health ' .
We Swedish Social Democrats chose to vote against the report on the prevention and reduction of risks associated with drug dependence , and this in view of the fact that Parliament voted through a number of amendments directly or indirectly entailing social acceptance of drug dependence .
The market must not encroach upon the political sphere , and democracy must not be restricted .
The developing countries are particularly vulnerable .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Jarzembowski , European industry needs efficient maritime transport .
That particularly applies to the amendment to Article 4.9 whereby the provision that would give industry the option of self-handling using land-based personnel would disappear from the directive .
Many people want to achieve this , but extremely few are working towards doing so .
Mr President , Commissioner , energy and the environment are two of the EU 's most important challenges .
This is strongly linked to environmental work , but the transport sector is also important to economic development and the possibility of growth .
Alternative fuels , including biofuel , must be introduced in a cost-effective way .
Through the decision we take today , we must avoid making future technological development more difficult than necessary .
Trade and industry need stable basic conditions if managers are to feel confident about their assessments for the purposes of
