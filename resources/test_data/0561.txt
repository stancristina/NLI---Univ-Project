These agreements are being entered into with the United States in the name of legal certainty at the same time as everything is being done to infringe legal certainty .
Ask the 3 000 prisoners - overwhelmingly foreigners - suspected of terrorism and consigned to American jails without having access to any information .
Ask the eleven million active FBI informers who , if this agreement is ever implemented , will be given permission to operate within the territories of the EU countries .
As I said before , this Parliament has no influence at all , either legally or constitutionally , but the debate may be of use in raising the storm that will be necessary for checking these attempts to undermine legal certainty .
Mr President , Commissioner , I wish firstly to say to the rapporteur , Mr Kreissl-Dörfler , that I have rarely been involved in work on a report that has been handled as diligently and fairly as Mr Kreissl-Dörfler has handled this report .
At the same time , I would draw attention to the fact that , by now abandoning the non-vaccination policy , we are creating changes that will be very significant for those countries that export extensively to third countries .
I therefore choose to go on believing that it is the non-vaccination policy that we shall continue to work towards , and I acknowledge that the situation will meanwhile be one in which we shall use vaccine , as we did for example in the Netherlands , under the very proficient administration of the Dutch .
In that connection , it is also important for me to support what was said by my colleague in the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , Mr Mulder , namely that it is important for the vaccinated animals not to remain in the food chain but to be removed from it .
I should also like to point out that there can be no question of imagining , as is done for example in Amendment No 11 , that milk and meat from vaccinated animals can be sold freely throughout the EU.
In this area , we must be very clear in demanding regionalisation so that , if such milk and meat is to be sold , it is within , and not across , national borders .
Although I am aware that this is not Commissioner Byrne 's area , I shall again draw attention to the fact that there is a need for export agreements , particularly with the Americans , so that we contain the losses there might be in connection with a future epidemic of foot and mouth disease and , especially , in connection with possible vaccination .
That is not of course what farmers need in this situation .
The problem arises due to the fact that the veterinary borders have been removed in connection with the introduction of the internal market .
Denmark has lost its independent veterinary status .
They close the door to the import of pork from throughout the EU if there has been vaccination against foot and mouth disease in one location in the EU.
Of this , Denmark alone is responsible for 600 000 to 700 000 tons .
If the exports were instead to be transferred to the EU 's internal market , this would mean an increase approaching 10 % in the supply of pork .
This would lead to a total collapse of the market throughout the EU.
The Commission has not remotely taken on board this loss of exports that occurs if no advance measures are taken regarding third countries ' acceptance of exports .
I must therefore call upon the Commission to ensure it takes account of all the factors - including those relating to trade - in evaluating what rules should apply in future .
Finally , Commissioner , do you intend to comply with my requests ?
- ( DA ) The Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party is able to support many of the proposed measures in the directive but is not in favour of its being possible to sell milk and meat from vaccinated animals within the common market on the basis of current technological capacity .
The change from the current policy of non-vaccination to one permitting emergency vaccination also requires the international agreement to be strengthened that guarantees full utilisation of the regionalisation principle , so that exports from EU countries not affected by foot-and-mouth disease can continue .
It is now five years since Parliament embarked upon the negotiations concerning the Statute and , for some of my fellow MEPs , this is a significant political process that , at one and the same time , secures Parliament 's power and legitimacy , with Parliament 's right to adopt its own statute an expression of a federal , European democracy .
For others , however , it is a farce of almost surrealistic dimensions .
Behind the democratic principles of parliamentary self-determination , we in fact find another agenda , one as prosaic as MEPs ' personal financial interests .
This Parliament has no impressive , democratic legitimacy to begin with .
In a democracy as rich in tradition as Sweden 's , turnout at the most recent election was less than 35 % , and in the UK was less than 24 % .
At least in the Nordic countries , people find it completely baffling that the Members of this Parliament are to be paid significantly more than national parliamentarians , especially when we are also safeguarding the possibility of maintaining or reintroducing the absurd expense systems which , in the Nordic countries , have been central subjects of criticism .
I would also observe that the issue of the national taxation of remuneration has now entered its final phase .
The point is
