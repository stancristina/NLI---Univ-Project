We must be wary of pitting the present problems of the Member States , especially unemployment , against the costs of helping applicant countries meet the criteria for membership .
Expansionism has its price , but it is a price that must be paid willingly for the consolidation of peace and stability in Europe .
It has been estimated that enlargement in the East will cost around ECU 15 billion net a year .
First , the overall increase in member costs could be used , at the same time exploiting the ECU 4 billion cut in structural funding .
Secondly , ECU 11 billion is expected to be saved in expenditure on agriculture , compared to other areas .
I think this is unacceptable , and European agriculture will not stand for it .
The aid level should not be allowed to drop .
The report is Parliament 's message to the Luxembourg summit on how to proceed in this historical enlargement process .
It is , as such , a marvellous opportunity to be heard .
The report approves , albeit in unclear terms , the marching order proposed by the Commission , making sure it includes all applicant countries in the process .
Semantic gobbledy-gook is of no interest to Parliament .
The Commission is seeking , through its own proposal , a dynamic enlargement process , which will not be achieved through the so-called regatta formula .
It would also prolong things , making it easy to put off changes in Union policy .
Is this what we really want ?
The committee was quite horrified that many members wished to lump together the Baltic states as one block , sweeping away these countries ' entirely different historical , social , and socio-economic backgrounds .
In summary it might be said that , in the light of the content of the report , in voting for it support is given for no one enlargement strategy , or possibly all of them , so subtly does this paper deal with them .
Security ?
Human rights ?
There are still a few problems to solve , though .
That is what is happening , though .
The criteria for economic and monetary union have caused such phenomena already amongst ourselves .
We therefore need the northern dimension view and a Baltic Sea policy .
We need the commitment of Russia to Europe and not Asia or a Greater Russia , which are the alternatives .
You could say that NATO 's spread eastward is seen in Russia as a gift to the Communists .
Labour legislation , at least as far as we are concerned in Finland , does not impose restrictions on development and development policy , which the Green Paper refers to .
Flexibility with security , as Mr Andersson said , is incredibly important .
It is extremely unwise to get into a situation where new developments come in at the expense of legislation and normal negotiation procedure .
In the ever-changing work scenario we need legislation to ensure the security of individuals .
I , along with the Committee on Women 's Rights , am deeply concerned about how the position of women will be affected in the changing work scenario .
There is also plenty of fresh evidence of this in Finland .
What is particularly worrying is the trafficking of younger people , even children , who are targets because it is their only means of survival .
I agree with the rapporteur that the problem must be tackled from the viewpoint of the victims .
The slave trade in women and children should feature in those talks , which should also spell out what is meant by the rights of women and children and sexual equality .
For example , the consumer should be able to make a true comparison between prices in shops .
I believe that we have achieved a good result , in that under article 10 of this directive Member States can go in for even better labelling than is required by this directive .
It is quite proper that certain exceptions and allowances have also been made .
We do not have the resources , the financial wherewithal , to tackle unemployment as one unit , and that is why what the individual Member States do is crucial .
The solutions contained in the European Parliament 's budget , or those which came out of the summit last week , are unsatisfactory , dealing , as they do , with part-time work and other unadventurous schemes , which will only serve to create an unemployed , poverty-stricken underclass .
This budget is a foretaste of what will be seen as a general thinning of funding .
We think that the equal flow of resources to all parts of the Community and Union is vital .
The 1998 budget has been undertaken with great presence of mind .
The reduction for agriculture is ECU 550 million ; in other words , agriculture is to get ECU 368 million less than this year .
This is a hefty reduction .
The Committee on Budgets bore that in mind in its resolution when it promised to approve a supplementary budget if the budgeted funds proved insufficient .
Parliament 's Committee on Employment and Social Affairs emphasises the importance of the social and financial study in its opinion of the fifth R & D framework programme .
The framework programme should also investigate changes in working life developments in the working community .
And technical studies do not exist as entities separate from society .
Studies and their results always have an influence on society , and this influence has to be respected .
It is vital that the national viewpoint be taken into account when planning and implementing research programmes .
Women have up till now been almost entirely absent from EU research planning and evaluation .
