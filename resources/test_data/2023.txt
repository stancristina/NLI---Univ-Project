Now it transpires that the situation could deteriorate even further as EU applicant countries from Central and Eastern Europe are projected to increase their net exports of pigmeat by nearly 300 % by the year 2006 .
At the same time they will be seeking derogations from the EU to enable them to produce pork to welfare and hygiene standards that would be considered illegal under current EU law .
If Britain is once again to reactivate a dynamic intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine , then immediate help is required to alleviate the catastrophic situation affecting rural Britain and affecting our pig and beef sectors in particular .
I hope this message is getting through to the British Chancellor of the Exchequer .
Mr President , this proposal introduces an extension of a current exemption to Directive 64/432 applicable to the Spanish Government .
Without this exemption , it would be required to implement a system of veterinary checks for tuberculosis and brucellosis , for each bovine animal exported from its region .
These are already , of course , implemented by many other states .
This exemption has important implications for my country .
Whilst Spain is being given exemption , the British meat industry is suffering heavily from the implementation of an allied directive which requires ruinously expensive veterinary checks in our slaughterhouses .
So rigorous are the requirements for veterinary supervision that we do not have enough British vets to carry out the work .
But instead of giving us more time , the Commission has commenced infringement proceedings .
In order to avoid ending up in the European Court of Justice , my government has had to recruit large numbers of EU vets , 300 of whom come from Spain .
If Spain has such a large surplus of vets that it can afford to send so many to my country , why is it having such difficulty implementing the system of veterinary checks required by this directive ?
It does not seem right to me that British slaughterhouses should be put through the hoops as a result of the Commission 's action whilst Spain is allowed to default on its obligations .
Why is the Commission giving Spain such an easy time ?
Should it not be asking why Spain can afford to send so many vets over to the United Kingdom to implement a related directive and perhaps be insisting that some of these officials be retained in their homeland to implement Community law in their own country ?
On that basis , I believe that this proposed directive is wrong and I will be voting against it .
While adding my thanks to the Council for the earlier answer , I would like to press the Council on a related matter .
The BBC recently produced evidence that 'wombs ' , as they described it , were for sale in Romania - that women were being paid to have children for export to Member States of the European Union .
Furthermore , the BBC alleged that this was being done with the tacit approval of the Romanian authorities because it was bringing hard currency into Romania .
Will the Council raise this in their dialogue with Romania in relation to Romania 's application for membership of the Community ?
I would like to thank the President-in-Office for a very long , detailed and serious reply .
Because I do not speak Portuguese I shall study the reply before the next question time and come back to you on it in April .
For now I would like you to give me a very simple reply to a very simple question of principle .
Do you accept that for legislation in a democratic environment , in which we are in the European Union , the public , whom the laws affect , should be able to see and hear what their elected representatives are doing to pass the laws ?
I do not think it is the case in the Council that the public is actually able to see and hear everything that their representatives say and do when passing laws .
Would you accept that principle ?
Just to follow on from Mr Newton Dunn 's question regarding the decisions made in secret in the Council , could the Minister possibly list those legislatures in the world , that he referred to , where decisions are made in secret ?
You were saying that the Council is not alone in being a legislature that makes its decisions in secret .
I just wondered if you could give us examples of other similar organisations in government that make these decisions in the same way .
Mr President , may I start by thanking the Commission for its timely , well-judged and well-forecasted document .
This is , of course , timed to coincide with the summit in Lisbon next week , and Parliament has had to work extremely speedily , for which I thank so many colleagues who have helped with this and , of course , the secretariat .
When I was a young child , a library was opened in a village where I was born and brought up ; when the head teacher of the village school opened the library , he said that there were over 4 000 books in the library , and I thought with all the wisdom of a six-year old child : well , that is all the books in the world .
Now , I personally own over 4 000 books , and , although this is hardly a knowledge revolution in itself , it is some indication , on a personal level extrapolated to a political level , of the pace of change in how knowledge is accessed , distributed , applied and refined .
We ought to put this into some sort of context , though , and remind ourselves that the majority
