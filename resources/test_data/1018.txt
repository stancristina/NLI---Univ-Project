remained in close contact with the candidate countries during all of the preparatory work on the position , and the Council intends to maintain these contacts in order to keep the candidate countries fully informed about further developments .
This solution will be of great help to , for example , the candidate countries in Central and Eastern Europe which have been in some doubt as to what they should do .
I really do think that this is , all in all , quite a good result .
We have ensured that the International Criminal Court is protected from being undermined , and I cannot say anything more about the matter .
Mr President , I was not of course asked about this in the written question .
Everyone , including all the candidate countries , is expected to uphold the common position .
I should be surprised - astonished , in fact - if they did not , so I think the honourable Member can be quite certain that they will do so .
With reference to the first question asked , I want to say that a common position is a common position .
It can be stretched in all directions , and I do not think that the President-in-Office is tackling the fundamental issue of whether we have an American strategy that urges other countries to enter into bilateral agreements whereby such countries undertake not to hand over American citizens .
It strikes me as self-evident that the Council has a credibility problem when , on the one hand , it states that it fully supports the setting up of the International Criminal Court and regards its establishment as a building block of international legal cooperation and , on the other hand , turns a blind eye to , and accepts , America 's blackmailing of third countries .
The only practical questions I want to put are the following : what is the gist of this solution , and is it a solution that the Council finds acceptable ?
Yes , in response to the last question I can say that a solution has been found that , in my view , will ensure there are no other candidate countries that enter into agreements corresponding to that entered into by Romania .
I should also like to add that , to my knowledge , Romania has still not ratified that agreement .
In my view , it is one of the great virtues of the common position that it gives very clear support to countries in the event of their being subjected to pressure .
Were this in fact to happen , it would , as I say , be just as well that we have this position , to which the new Member States can also adhere .
I can guarantee that any agreement entered into between the United States and the EU will respect human rights in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union , stating that ' The Union is founded on the principles of liberty , democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , and the rule of law , principles which are common to the Member States . '
The notions that the Danish Presidency has tabled proposals for binding rules governing the storage of data concerning telecommunications traffic , that telecommunications suppliers will have to store data concerning telecommunications traffic for up to two years and that such information will have to be collected in central databases and made available to the other Member States are based on a misunderstanding - I would almost say a very creative misunderstanding - that could have been avoided if the media had consulted the country holding the Presidency .
The proposal has no connection with the increased cooperation with the United States , involving talks concerning an agreement on mutual legal assistance and mutual extradition .
This once again stated that the European Union has for a long time been opposed to , and continues vigorously to reject , any use of the death penalty The states will , of course , enter into such agreements in accordance with the national rules .
Where the European institutions are concerned , this will take place in accordance with the European Union 's rules .
The request by Tony Bunyan of Statewatch that the documents be made available for scrutiny has been met with partial rejection because the negotiations concerned were secret .
My first question is about why the Council is holding its cards so close to its chest when these are matters of very broad general interest that are at stake .
Looking at Titles V and VI of the Treaty on European Union , it is apparent from Article 24 that , when it is necessary to conclude an agreement with one or more States etc in implementation of these Titles , agreements may be entered into on behalf of the Council without Parliament 's being consulted and without any public debate .
Nor do I know if what it says is true .
I am sorry , then , Mr Krarup , but perhaps it would be an idea to submit a written question or put the question next time .
The Council has not discussed Colonel Gadaffi 's speeches .
Libya has still not given an answer where this issue is concerned .
Libya participated in the ministerial conference in Valencia as the Presidency 's guest .
The first prepares the way for a rapprochement with the EU and clearly signals a break with the past , while the second reflects the fact that Libya 's ambitions on the African continent are incompatible with participation in the Barcelona Process .
In the EU 's view , a strong role in Africa and participation in the Barcelona Process complement each other very well indeed
