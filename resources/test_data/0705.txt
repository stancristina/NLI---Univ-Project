oil on an international level .
However , the persecution of smokers , tobacco producers and all those who work in the tobacco industry is almost turning into a witch hunt on the American model .
Why does nobody talk about alcoholism ?
Madam President , I would like to say that taking the law into one 's own hands is in no way a political argument , but , by the same token , saying that someone who expresses different arguments is being paid is not a political argument either .
This is unacceptable and I think that the President should call Mr Blak to order .
The abolition of Community aid for tobacco producers will not reduce the effects on public health .
Madam President , please forgive me but do the political groups realise that each roll-call vote costs the European taxpayer ECU 1 , 000 ?
All passengers and crew , 72 people in all , are unaccounted for .
Only a short time has passed since then .
Mr President , I believe that if the European Union had shown less tolerance of the rather high-handed acts of the then government , the fate of that government might have been better .
The observations set out in the resolution are not erroneous , but they are rather one-sided and I believe that they are somewhat hasty because , particularly with regard to the constitutional court , our information comes only from the Albanian opposition party .
The European Parliament 's delegation responsible for overseeing relations with countries of eastern Europe recently visited Tirana and , in my opinion , undertook an extremely successful mission to Albania , within the framework of the Fourth Intergovernmental Meeting between the European Parliament and the Albanian Parliament .
Given these facts I find it impossible to understand of what use this resolution can be , which I very much fear provides an alibi for the reasoning and for the tactics of Mr Berisa .

However , such intense anxieties cannot be confronted in this way .
If we look at things in this way , then we will realize the dangers involved in liberalization , which is being pushed forward by the Commission , and of course we will assume our own responsibilities and react accordingly .
I would however like to make the following points .
Rail companies should have the right of open access to the networks to enable them to undertake international freight transportation .
Therefore , under these preconditions , my group basically supports the White Paper and Mr Sarlis ' report .
Firstly , the rail network is literally facing scandalously unfair competition from trucks .
I want a clear direction .
I am thinking here of the Balkans , of Greece , etc .
Priority is still given to the car and to motorways , while crumbs are given to the railways .
However , we must not lose sight of the fact that our effort to promote and secure the euro as an international currency and to ensure its stability on international markets is being carried out in the context of the implementation of austerity programmes , strict monetary discipline , the dictates of the stability pact and , finally , in the context of total upheaval in the jobs market and the dwindling of workers ' security and social rights .
For this reason , Mr President , they will react , and for this reason account must be taken of their anxieties .
As both share the basic principles of the free world , they worked together to defend them and to preserve them throughout the long and dangerous period of the Cold War .
With the ending of the Cold War , bipolarization and the rivalry between the two superpowers , after the earthquake of 1989 , the need to free Europe and the United States from what has stood in the way of a more open relationship is becoming more and more insistent .
God help us if , on the threshold of a new globalized era , the United States believed it had sole responsibility for the whole world , and a duty to play the role of police constable of international order and security .
And over and above the smoothing out of the current economic problems in which these contrasts are revealed , it will emphasize the tremendous importance assumed by the general framework which must contain long-term efforts for an honourable understanding , from the other side of the Atlantic as well .
From this standpoint , no-one has the right to oppose the bridging of the Atlantic , if indeed there is to be a common perception of viable development and social cohesion , promotion of peace and democracy , equality of the sexes , guarantees of prosperity and security in the world , progress in science and technology , and protection of life and the environment .
However , not only is the United States Congress unmoved by these protestations , but on 11 June 1997 it reinforced even more this preposterous web of legislation with eight amendments that were approved by its part-session .
How can we therefore not be mistrustful of such a partner ?
There is also the issue of the death penalty .
Mr President , George Washington bequeathed to his countrymen the principle of not allowing anyone to become involved in their internal affairs , and not becoming involved in the affairs of the rest of the world .
And not only in regions such as Yugoslavia or the Middle East .
The crucial point to which the European Commission is now called upon to address itself is the demand to wipe out this imbalance at all levels of EU-US cooperation , as far as possible of course .
There are aspects such as the commercial or the economic aspects where we can see that the European Union does have a claim
