This exemption is not being respected .
The world had hoped that the EU would show leadership , demonstrate its solidarity with the developing countries and make efforts to secure genuine free trade with full access to the industrialised countries ’ markets , particularly for the poorest countries .
From where I am standing , however , the EU behaved almost worse than the United States .
There is no desire to do anything about our own exorbitant and destructive agricultural subsidies .
The EU gets on its high horse over the United States’s cotton policy – and , indeed , has good reason for doing so – but it behaves in precisely the same way itself , for example when it comes to sugar .
What should , moreover , have been a development package to set the Thames on fire , and one that would have really got things moving for the poor , has ended up as a piffling little matchbox .
What a disappointment !     Mr President , Commissioner , almost 50 years since the Community was founded , there is now still no specific legislative framework for port services .
Of course , port services come under the fundamental freedoms listed by the EC Treaty – that is to say , freedom of movement and the right of establishment , as mentioned by yourself , Commissioner – and the general principles of the Treaty do not take full account of the special conditions that apply in ports .
We in the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe are , then , in favour of a ports directive , albeit not in the form presented in the Commission ’s proposal .
We have supported the rapporteur , Mr Jarzembowski , in his efforts to transform this directive into something more sensible .
Mr Jarzembowski is to remove self-handling from the proposal in order to make it less controversial .
Meanwhile , the port workers have repaid the good will that exists by staging disturbances in front of our Parliament building and smashing a large number of windows in the facade .
We need a ports directive that can establish the framework for free competition between service providers in ports and also for such freer competition between ports as will provide a safeguard against state aid that distorts competition .
The Commission ’s very point of departure is that , by putting an end to the monopolies , we could obtain more efficient and better run ports .
We should then see more goods transported by ship , something that would reduce the burden on both the roads and the environment .
It has to be recognised that the Commission ’s proposal contains a number of weaknesses .
There must be better transitional rules when new service providers take over from old ones .
Given the chaotic nature of developments so far , it is understandable that many should want the Commission to withdraw the proposal .
Precisely in view of the chaotic way things have gone , there are many who will simply vote against the proposal , but we continue to be interested in a ports directive .     Madam President , first and foremost , I should like to congratulate Mrs Fischer Boel on this reform .
The result is clear : more free trade where sugar is concerned .
I am annoyed that Parliament has made its contribution too late .
In spite of many calls to get things under way last year , we are now in a situation in which we have had our day , as the decision has already been made in the Council of Agriculture Ministers .
That does not mean that the European Parliament has made no impression on the reform .
Quite a few features of the reform reflect the wishes expressed by the European Parliament .
I am very pleased that we have , at long last , adopted a reform of the common organisation of the market in sugar , which has existed largely unchanged for 40 years .
However , I should like us to go still further .
Only once we have removed the national quotas so that production occurs in the places that are best for it and where it is most profitable shall we be able to talk in terms of having a free internal market .
Unfortunately , time does not permit me to do so .
That is something that , fortunately , a number of Member States are doing .
Meanwhile , others are procrastinating and have not yet begun investing .
It is not only sugar cane but also other crops that can be cultivated in areas previously given over to sugar cane and that can be used for biofuel which – environmentally , economically and in terms of supply – will be an important part of future energy production .
Irrespective of how justified it may be , the reform – including , in particular , the reduction in prices – will have harmful and far-reaching consequences for some of those poorest countries in the world that cannot cope with free competition in the world market .
It is therefore an urgent matter for us to appropriate adequate resources for the restructuring faced by these countries .
If the ACP countries are to suffer as a result of these arrangements being abolished , it is of course because , with our absurd trading system , we have kept them in conditions resembling those of slavery , and if slaves are freed without being helped to cope successfully , they are obviously in a worse situation than before .
It is grotesque that we only give them a pittance , when we richly reward our own sugar producers and sugar industry .
There is a lot of money to be saved by phasing out the common organisation of the market in sugar , so such compensation is amply
