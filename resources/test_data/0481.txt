We can achieve much more with staffing levels as they are at present , as long as the Staff Regulations are flexible about the sensible use of resources .
We have to emphasise the importance of the responsibility for how revenue is used .
Mr President , the great challenge for police cooperation in Europe in the future will not be the harmonisation of legislation , but the creation of practical cooperation at grassroots level among all European states .
Europol must be granted significant powers and a clear role in both the coordination of checks taking place on the Union 's external border and in the development of the information exchange and early warning systems used by the authorities .
For this reason , one of the strategies prior to membership should be to focus to a greater degree than is currently the case on training the police and customs authorities in the former Communist bloc .
At Tampere there must also be broader debate on the future challenges facing police cooperation in the Union , with special focus on the problems stemming from the enlargement process .
We have had a splendid building constructed here , the Parliament building , with smoking and non-smoking areas clearly demarcated .
I am not against smokers : they may smoke in peace to their hearts ' content , but I wish they would respect those who do not smoke and keep well clear of the non-smoking areas , allowing us to enjoy a smokeless environment .
This must not be left to one side ; indeed , in the light of the events of recent weeks , it is even more important that the Commission should produce its proposal promptly .
At present a quarter of the members of the Commission are women , which cannot be regarded as satisfactory if we consider the new provisions in the Treaty of Amsterdam that emphasise the importance of equality .
Mr President , when the Treaty of Amsterdam becomes effective next month the Union will have a lot more scope than at present to act to ensure the single market can work effectively .
This is a good thing , but the problem is that the Member States have not up till now had a clear enough vision of how cooperation under the third pillar might be more effectively developed .
The problems that are rife in the single market , such as drug trafficking , the growing availability of illegal drugs and trafficking in human beings , and the contributory cause of all such problems , which is the less than perfect way surveillance is carried out on the Union 's external borders , all call for Europol to play an even greater role in the future than is provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam .
Energy taxation is one of the best and most effective controls which society can use to reduce emissions and try to protect and improve the environment .
The argument that there should be continued support for the production of combined electricity and heating is extremely important and most welcome .
The rapporteur , Patrick Cox , has already simplified and clarified the Commission 's proposal , but in my opinion it could have been simplified still further .
Levels of taxation for fuels used for production and those used for heating are now so close to one another that they could be harmonised .
A marsh will produce roughly the same amount of peat in a year as a forest does wood pulp per unit area .
The second point is this .
Internal air traffic in small countries is insignificant , but in the large Member States , such as Finland , it is extremely important .
For this reason , a harmonised taxation system would not treat different Member States fairly .
The subject is also linked to the idea of promoting health and safety , as has been mentioned here , and in many Member States we have seen that it is this area that has been affected most by experiments in reducing working time , in spite of the fact that the purpose was often to increase employment .
There are good reasons for extending the health and safety protection accorded to employees to include self-employed drivers , not just for the sake of the drivers in question , but for the sake of the other drivers on the road .
Conditions are different among the Member States of the Union , and we also need to take account of the problem of night work .
In Finland , for example , which is a big country , good , efficient services depend on a long-distance transport network .
The other proposal for a regulation is on the agenda for second reading under the cooperation procedure and is the subject of a report by Mr Torres Couto .
When the budget for 1998 was being debated , Parliament agreed that an advisory working party on human rights should be set up .
This working party would be treated in the same way as committees made up of Member States ' representatives .
The establishment of the working party was already proposed in Parliament 's opinion as set out in Mr Torres Couto 's report , but this was rejected by the Council , so the rapporteur is now proposing it again , and I support this .
I support these amendments and I hope Parliament will adopt them , as they are consistent with the position Parliament has so often adopted in the past .
There is a proposal in Amendment 19 for longer time limits when abatement equipment malfunctions or breaks down .
If the time limit is not changed an efficient , modern power plant will have to be closed down temporarily virtually whenever there is a problem , and replaced with plant that cannot match it in terms of its ability to
