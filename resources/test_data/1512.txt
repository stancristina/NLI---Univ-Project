that we should ask the Commission and the Council to conduct , in that context , in-depth conversations on human rights .
The report by Michel Barnier , which was delivered to me and to Mr Barroso at the beginning of May , has become the basis of a Presidency document that has enabled us to agree on a very precise programme of tasks for the next eight presidencies .
I am grateful to the Member States and the Commission for their willingness to go for a new approach to one subject that was of particular personal importance to me .
I can tell your House that the German Presidency will therefore , during the first six months of 2007 – the deadline has been deliberately left open – present a report on the state that discussions have reached and on the possible further developments .
In order to further improve working methods and comitology , we worked very hard – as I , at the outset , promised that we would – to get the Council , when acting as legislator in the codecision procedure , to take its decision openly and in public , and actually succeeded in this .
It is to be hoped that the other ten will join us .
After all , our anthem is the Ode to Joy , not an ode to sadness , so , as this Austrian Presidency draws to a close , we should simply say : Let us bring a bit more joy into the work we do .
This not only concerns Germany and France , but also the presidencies of Finland , Portugal and Slovenia .
I have just met Belarus’s opposition leader , Mr Alexander Milinkevich .
When we listen to you , Chancellor Schüssel , or to the President of the Commission , things start to become more agreeable , given that in every third sentence of your speeches , you talk about social cohesion , social responsibility in Europe , the importance of social policy and the decision that the Services Directive entailed , and which points the way ahead .
What is not working is the Council of European Heads of State or Government which , as a rule , does not decide on anything .
I hope that you will , tomorrow , say that with the same clarity to the President of the United States .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we have heard a piece of Mr Poettering’s election campaign and an entire speech from Mr Schulz’s election campaign .
The game is blithely continuing : when Europe produces a good policy , national governments proudly take the credit ; when a bad policy comes along , they say that Brussels decreed it .
We also regret that there has been no progress on deregulation .
The meeting of the European Council has , however , in my view made it just as clear that the period of reflection has not in any way been used to identify the reasons why the Constitution was rejected in the referendums in France and in the Netherlands , let alone to react to this in some way .
Now we no longer hear about them .
The question also arises of whether the Presidency of the Council has been successful in its efforts to improve the quality of cooperation with the European Parliament and the institutions .
Here , too , the European Parliament served the Presidency a very good ball , but unfortunately Vice-Chancellor Gorbach did not catch it , and the European Parliament 's attitude , which was more favourable for Austria as well , could not be transferred to the Council .
A minimum consensus was arranged , and they were happy to deprive Europe of precisely the resources that it needed in order to fulfil the duties given to it from other quarters .
I am , of course , also in favour of the Greek Cypriot Government , that is to say the Government of Cyprus , doing everything in its power to pave the way for the Turkish-speaking population to share in a single state and hence in the European Union .
We are the boys who will make you think again , we are the boys who will stop your little game .
Very many in Europe see Austria’s European Presidency as a success story .
Permit me to take this opportunity to offer sincere thanks in this connection to a pillar of European policy in Brussels , Ambassador  Woschnagg .
You are meeting the Americans today and tomorrow .
Foreign policy is also important .
It is interesting , however , that the Austrian Greens have all left the Chamber .
However , we remained steadfast and , today , we have , for example , in connection with what was the very contentious issue of the accession of the Czech Republic , a majority that is now pleased that that country joined the EU.
This is obvious to everyone who feels affection for this painfully acquired child of European unity .
It is not right that a minority put its stamp on the whole of Europe .
I have just worked out that , so far , we have seen 32 matches in the football world cup , of which 20 have pitted Europe against the rest of the world , that is to say against other continents .
Where do its strengths lie , and why has little consolidation taken place in Europe ?
The European Parliament is happy to support you in this venture .
Transparency , logical decisions and hence predictability for companies are aspects that we shall have to discuss over the coming months .
Nevertheless , in the case of such reports , even those that come from international bodies , we should ask ourselves far more frequently whether they actually achieve anything
