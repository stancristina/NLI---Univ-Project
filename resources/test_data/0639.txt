If so , when will the Council officially release the citizens of Austria from this ordeal , which violates their democratic rights ?
Mr President , Commissioner , it is a very positive sign that Lisbon will see focused discussion on the development of the information society in Europe .
For that reason , the e-Europe initiative is in a more crucially important position than ever before with regard to Union competitiveness and , consequently , from the point of view of our citizens also .
The proposals for reform in the initiative are ambitious , but do not even necessarily go far enough .
The initiative should also be supplemented by the future challenges facing those countries with a more advanced information society .
The clear lead Europe enjoys in the world of wireless communications is not enough for us to stop caring about the future of the European information society and about whether we really can keep up with the competition .
Apart from reduced costs , the growth in electronic commerce also means that questions of security should be able to be resolved to the satisfaction of consumers and that defects in legislation should be corrected .
The amount is much too small .
Fortunately , the Commission has shown initiative in this matter , however , and has focused attention on accelerating developments here .
As European legislators , we have before us an immense challenge , if we intend to keep legislation abreast of the times .
Control of the new operational environment will also require increased technical and pedagogic facilities and resources in training schemes .
With regard to the concrete proposals contained in the e-Europe communiqu√© , I can only wonder why the Council has not discussed them before , so as to ensure commitment on the part of Member States .
An information society for all is certainly an area of focus for the Commissioner in this process .
It is important , and I thank her for it .
We also have to reach agreement with management and labour , for example , on the subject of remote working and vocational training , if what we are talking about is an information society for all .
Another matter is that we have been deregulating the telecommunications industry for around ten years , and now , with these massive Internet players merging there is a fear that they will once again start regulating the market .
Thirdly , the quoted share value for a certain Internet company rose by a sudden 4 000 % in one month , and this came about merely because unsubstantiated information was given about it for the stock market .
Mr President , it would seem that a war that was started to end terrorism is turning into a situation where a new terrorism is just starting .
We have condemned the Russian action over the recent months in five separate resolutions .
The extension of the war and terrorism is a major threat to us all .
In addition , speedy and unhindered access to the area on the part of relief organisations must be guaranteed once and for all .
Finally , the principal rule with respect to refugees is that they should be helped near to where they live and helped to return to their homes .
We should be reminded , however - so as not to be too sanctimonious in all of this - that when Chechen refugees turned to us for help we did not receive them in our own countries as we did on such a large scale with Kosovo .
The Commission must oblige the Member States to work in such a way that the principle of additionality is implemented both nationally and regionally .
In some cases this violation is covered up by including as national regional funds development funds , which are mainly , however , targeted at the fastest growing areas .
Mr President , Commissioner , the rapporteurs Mrs Haug and Mr Ferber have drafted their first report on next year ' s EU budget .
I wish them both luck in the task facing them .
For that reason the work is important and calls for stringent budgetary discipline .
In addition to stringent budgetary discipline we wish to stress the following : our Group gives its full support to the package of reforms as proposed by Mr Kinnock .
But the reforms will require cooperation with the staff .
The work of reform might also demand additional budgetary proposals , which we urge the Commission to be prepared for .
Mrs Haug' s report stresses the importance of culture as a means of creating jobs .
However , culture as a means of livelihood is an area which is rapidly growing in importance .
Our group also believes that Category 1 of the financial perspective - agricultural expenditure - should not be used as a primary source of financing in response to needs that become manifest in external policy .
In his report , Mr Turmes , does not in all respects advocate the same way of thinking , however .
The report does contain many good ideas .
We really do have to invest in research into energy sources .
The harmonisation of taxation and aid schemes is a different matter .
Renewables can be made more competitive by increasing consumer choice .
To no good purpose , the report tries to define renewable energy by raising the question of peat as a special area .
The position with regard to peat cannot be determined according to the same standards as biogases , for example .
These are big issues , and Parliament must address them seriously .
Finland is the only country whose television picture cannot be picked up in Parliament .
They now get two channels , and I
