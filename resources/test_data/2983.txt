The other reason is the governments' , and also the Commission 's , fear of using Community resources for subsidies which are not directed towards farmers or large public works .
This was a depressing and alarming example .
I believe that this amendment would resolve the small problem which had arisen .
For that reason , it is very important that it should be the European Union that recognises and protects these languages , over and above the positions of governments .
Is it not also negligent of European governments not to consider the consequences of climate change in terms of desertification and loss of biodiversity in our countries ?
That aggression has been made manifest in all kinds of acts , including terrorist acts , which have been condemned by the international community .
That does not mean we should hide our worries , our criticisms and our hopes of seeing the Cuban people progress .
Let us not forget , furthermore , that this question implies a direct condemnation of the occupied territories .
Why are we not making a real contribution to strengthening the Palestinian Authority ?
I ought to mention , however , that some problems have been encountered .
They are sometimes very significant mistakes , to the detriment of some of these countries .
As the rapporteur says , we have reached the final stages of a regime for protecting banana imports , which will come to an end on 31 December 2005 .
I believe that Commissioner Nielson is at present aware of those problems .
Now is exactly the right moment , to my mind , for the Commission to have produced its communication to the Council and to Parliament , which we are debating today .
They are far from reaching an agreement which would be binding on all parties , and on the main donors in particular .
In other words , for example , it would be helpful if the Commission were to bear in mind the need for horizontal and geographical or regional budget lines to be treated equally , so as to introduce and guarantee open , transparent calls for tender , which do not always come about .
In 1996 , the Development Assistance Committee ( DAC ) of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) published a strategy document entitled ' Shaping the 21st Century : The Contribution of Development Cooperation ' .
They have not , however , made a great impression on a large number of countries , which are continuing to grant tied aid , either openly or covertly .
.
In addition to the Erika I and II packages , other proposals were put forward by the Commission just after the Prestige disaster and they are at present being examined by the Council and Parliament .
In that respect , I must tell you that we have had to initiate 10 infringement proceedings against 10 Member States that have not sufficiently incorporated the new provisions on monitoring by port state control and by classification societies .
This in fact relates to two of the key elements in resolving this issue : port control , which thus enables prevention .
Then , after that mistake , we found ourselves without a safe haven , just as there was no safe haven in the case of the Erika accident but , much more seriously , just as there was no safe haven a month and a half later in the case of the Vicky accident , when we faced another dangerous situation .
Therefore , we are going to require in all cases , as we are doing now , full compliance with the regulations currently in force and transposition of the regulations into the various national legislations .
Once and for all , the European Union has decided to face these problems rather than just waiting for the next disaster along our coast .
To this end , we call for the mobilisation of all Community funds and technical resources , without exception , for the adoption of the supplementary fund for compensation for oil pollution damage and for further budget resources for environmental impact assessments , compensation for losses not covered by a current international agreement , the creation of a network for the exchange of experience in the field of hydrocarbon pollution , emergency action plans , etc .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in his explanatory statement the rapporteur states that the Prestige accident highlights the importance , among other things , of adequately monitoring full compliance with existing European and international regulations on maritime safety .
In conclusion , in addition to thanking the members of the Committee on Employment for their unanimous support for the opinion , I want to reiterate my gratitude to the seafarers , fishermen , volunteers and all those who have fought with great determination to combat pollution and support the environment and fisheries resources .
The result of the work of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , Mr President , is better than we could have hoped .
The fuel oil is still reaching the beaches .
I think that it is fair to say here that the European Maritime Safety Agency must be situated in the country that was most affected by the disasters .
It is important that we try to establish the necessary resources and mobilise them to ensure that this does not happen and try to avoid drawing political advantage from these situations .
The Socialist Group is also tabling an amendment and , of course , what we want is to create a temporary committee , and I do not think that this is the time or the place to call into question the admissibility of this amendment , as tabled , and this refers to both our own amendment and that of the rapporteur .
I would like to thank Mr Sterckx and congratulate him on his report on
