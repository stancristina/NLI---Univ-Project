I should like to begin by correcting a misunderstanding .
It is important for every authority to have an internal phase of its proceedings in which any ideas may be discussed and any proposals appear on the table , without its being obliged to make them public .
The Commission should also be entitled to have confidential drafts on the table throughout the preparative phase .
Our demand to exercise supervision applies from the time when the Commission sends documents out or in the case of their being leaked , as happens not infrequently .
In that way , there would be equality for all , and that is not the case with the framework agreement .
In the legislation process , we sit , as we all know , in committees and debate draft bills .
The lobbyists , who sit behind , also have them , but we elected representatives cannot obtain them .
We are asked to comment on it , but we cannot obtain a copy .
When he took up his post , Mr Prodi promised to bring this situation to an end .
And it is as individual MEPs and rapporteurs that we should have this legal entitlement and not by going down on our knees before the President .
What is more , a President might come along to whom one preferred not to kowtow .
Article 276 of the Treaty states that the Commission should submit all the necessary information to Parliament in connection with the discharge procedure .
According to the framework agreement , it is only the Conference of Presidents , Parliament ' s President and the chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control who can ask the Commission for information .
From a political point of view , it is unacceptable that the chairman of the Committee should be able to decide which information can be passed on .
From a practical point of view , it will lengthen the discharge procedure .
It is unreasonable , however , that the Commission ( which is to be supervised ) should be involved in deciding which information is to be made available .
We hope that a better agreement will successfully be reached regarding the provision of information as an integral part of the discharge procedure .
In its present form , the agreement constitutes a restriction on Parliament ' s right to information , as guaranteed under the Treaty .
We note that , in its proposal , the Commission considers that this proposal is not covered by the Danish reserve , in spite of the fact that this matter concerns a positive list which , as we understand it , is in fact covered .
It is quite unacceptable that we can get into a situation in which we are going to reduce the level of safety for our children .
Now , I see that the Commissioner is not listening .
Anyone who did go to the trouble of observing their children would quickly discover , as has already been said a number of times , that children suck away at anything they get their hands on , and not only on things that are intended to be put into their mouths .
It can no longer be taken for granted that people can have children , and suspicions are mounting where phthalates are concerned .
It is only four months since the Commission sent out a communication of just under 30 pages concerning the precautionary principle .
Is it not only right to put all the fine words into practice now about protecting health and the environment and to make use of this principle in an area we still know very little about ?
I should like to know why the Commission only wants the six phthalates which have been investigated to be banned , instead of them all .
I think still further action needs to be taken and a ban imposed with no restriction on age , but I hope at least that Amendment 20 will be adopted .
Mr President , I think there is every reason to thank both the Commission and Mr Arvidsson : the Commission because , in spite of criticism , it has come up with a proposal in this area , and Mr Arvidsson because I think that , with his report , we are obtaining a responsible framework for the use of phthalates in toys .
We know that they are suspected of possibly causing cancer , as well as disturbing the balance of hormones .
If we were not to make use of the precautionary principle in this case , I find it hard to see when the principle might be applied at all .
We also heard this argument in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .
I think the argument is completely unacceptable .
If it were in fact to be accepted , then any restriction at all upon the use of dangerous chemicals , not merely in toys but also in foodstuffs and other products , would be prevented .
That would be the ideal situation , but I am inclined to vote in favour of the present proposed compromise whereby , as a first step , there should be a warning label on toys for that group .
I think that would be a sensible health policy .
Mr President , Commissioner , guaranteeing public health is the objective of one of today ' s most important areas of legislation .
At the same time , European consumers have the right to clear and easily understandable information , so that they know where the meat they are eating comes from .
I would ask all colleagues to vote in favour of Amendment 6 which Karl Erik Olsson and I have tabled with a view to making it compulsory for minced meat to bear a label stating the date when it was
