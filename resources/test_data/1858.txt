It had a preset expiry period , and last , but not least , it provided for the development of a sectoral industrial policy which went hand-in-hand with social and regional measures .
On the other , and to some extent as a consequence , we have to provide for a budgetary structure to cover those activities which it is felt should survive the ECSC itself .
We must therefore see what guidelines we should set for the Fifth Framework Programme .
This being so , I do not understand the concern many colleagues have expressed over this dispute with the non-industrial fleet when the European Union has in fact made use of catch opportunities which do not impact upon the non-industrial fleet .
We fear a new wave of violence , particularly after signature of the agreements .
Why not bring a little poetry into this Parliament , which is so lacking in it ?
I had built my house of palms with lattice-structured walls packed with mud , adobe style .
But I shall pass on this document to everyone who wants to hear it , since I believe it is the voice of Latin America 's country people , which is seldom heard in this Parliament .
I will conclude , Mr President , by saying to the Commissioner that the serious - very serious - points arising for the Commission from the comments in the explanatory statement of this report are a matter of concern to us .
The Gallagher report , which was , as I have already said , adopted at the last part-session , stressed , among other factors , the need to adopt special measures to protect juvenile fish , and particularly hake .
The second reason adduced by the Commission , that third countries fish in the Adriatic without being obliged to comply with the minimum size , collapses unaided , since the Commission itself certifies that 70 %-80 % of the catch in this area is by Italian ships , as quoted in the discussion document it produced .
On the second amendment by the Socialist Group , I would like to explain , Madam President , that this paragraph 32 was modified by the Committee on Budgetary Control through an amendment introduced by one of our colleagues .
In any democracy , Parliament is the institution to which the executive body is answerable and which must discharge its responsibilities regarding the management of public revenue .
Given the follow-up to the 1996 Inter-Governmental Conference and enlargement to the East , it is vital to ensure that we have officials who are skilled in management and that each directorate general has its own financial management unit .
The European Parliament believes that this should be extended to the other sectors , for instance by revising Articles 23 and 24 of the coordinating regulation governing the Structural Funds .
This is an important issue as regards responsibility for the Commission 's general intervention powers .
The need to formulate and improve current legislation must go hand in hand with the will to apply it .
In some departments there are virtually no women , while in others there are very high numbers .
Mr President , I firstly have to express my regret that the group of visitors I invited are not among our spectators today as their journey here has been held up on French roads .
Mr President , as the Commissioner explained a moment ago , serious problems have arisen not only in France but also in neighbouring countries .
The timetable is now a pressing one and we must now progress with maximum precision , given that we are less than two years away from the setting-up of the European Central Bank and barely more than 24 months away from the introduction of the euro .
The Council is shortly to make a pronouncement on three aspects , which are still to be defined , which are fundamental elements of the credibility , security and stability of future Monetary Union .
Planned Monetary Union requires everyone to make an unambiguous pledge to the citizens of Europe .
Mr President , the reports on future Economic and Monetary Union which this House will be voting on tomorrow are very important .
It was precisely Commissioner de Silguy 's reply , in which he suggested that this convergence criterion could possibly be calculated as a strictly arithmetic mean of the three best countries with the lowest inflation rate , which led me , together with a number of colleagues , to table an amendment on that subject , because the inflation criterion is an eminently statistical criterion and is not accountable .
Firstly I would like to congratulate the various rapporteurs and then concentrate on a number of matters arising from the stability pact .
These are the terms in which the Commission is presenting its stability pact recommendation , smoothing off some of the initial German recommendation 's rough edges .
As a representative from one of those States , and on the basis of the notion of solidarity so often invoked in this House , I thought it my duty to emphasize this point which has genuinely been incorporated into the amendments approved in the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee and which I hope will be approved during tomorrow 's sitting .
I am thinking here specifically of rural , peripheral or inter-island regions , which are less profitable .
However , I would nevertheless like to congratulate Mr Beller√© on his favourable report on the proposal for an eighth Parliament and Council Directive on summer-time arrangements .
In Spain , the annual energy saving amounts to 11 , 500 million pesetas , equivalent to 600 million kilowatts/hour .
Mr President , the subject of employment has indeed come up again in our debates , on this occasion to send a message to
