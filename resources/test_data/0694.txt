to negative tender in this manner ?
The lowest subsidy would win the franchise for a certain period of time .
Why could not the sub-post office in a remote village also be put out to this sort of negative tender ?
It would therefore be up to the appropriate democratically accountable government body , local , regional or national - probably under overall EU supervision - to set the service criteria and the financial resources for meeting this particular social purpose .
Otherwise the postal services can be left to all the demands and constraints of the marketplace .
Mr President , Commissioner , it is no coincidence that I am the fifth Member of this House from Scotland to rise to speak in this debate .
That is a measure of the importance to us of our postal services .
Scotland as a country is larger than some Member States .
It has many remote mainland communities accessible only by road , sometimes served poorly by public transport , sometimes not at all .
Such communities rely for their survival on having local facilities , such as a school , a post office and a shop .
It is on the last two that the elderly , in particular , depend .
Often they are located together , each service being made more viable by the existence of the other .
Scotland also has many island communities , some of which can be reached by air but most of which depend on sea ferries .
It has been calculated that the actual cost of carrying a letter from Edinburgh to the Central Highlands is about ten times that of carrying the same letter across London .
And it is about four times the postage cost actually charged .
The more remote the community , the greater the difference becomes .
That is the measure of the problem .
It is not to oppose liberalisation to ask that it be done in a way that takes account of these factors and allows the continuation of a universal and affordable postal service .
It is for all our remote and island communities , no matter where in the European Union they are situated , and not just for the people of Scotland , that I ask you to preserve the vital lifeline that their postal services provide .
We are about to discuss the subject of reforming the Commission and you will recall , Madam President , that at the beginning of the last session , I raised with you the question of whether , in the interests of openness and transparency , the Members ' register of interests could be made more available to the public by being published on the Internet .
You promised Parliament you would raise this subject with the Quaestors that very evening .
I wonder if you are now in a position to confirm to Parliament that the Quaestors have agreed in principle that the register should be published on the Internet and , if so , whether you will personally set them a deadline - perhaps 1 April - for doing so .
I am glad to be here together with President Prodi and my colleague , Michele Schreyer , to present the White Paper adopted by the Commission this morning : " Reforming the Commission " .
As honourable Members will see from the document , which will be available to them today , the unprecedented consultations with the staff of the Commission , with this Parliament and with the Council , which have taken place since the adoption of the consultation document in January , have been very productive and resulted in useful refinements .
Together with Romano Prodi , I express my gratitude to this House and to the very large number of people who have put time and effort into giving us their constructive responses .
The White Paper puts reform in its proper political context .
In the Commission , systems and structures have built up over forty years in which successive enlargements have occurred .
The treaties have been revised , new managerial tasks have been attributed by this Parliament and by the Council to the Commission , and many other changes of great significance have occurred in our Union , in our continent and in the world .
Those realities , together with the approach of further enlargements , all counsel strongly for modernisation of the Commission , so that this essential institution can fulfil its primary tasks of policy conception and development , of treaty application and of management of the public resources and do so with maximum effectiveness , maximum responsibility and maximum accountability .
The sustained independence and strength of the Commission are , of course , basic to that mission as this House has repeatedly recognised .
Reform and renewal are essential for that purpose too .
The Commission is not and will not be a secretariat of any kind , and that is clear to all of the institutions - it is well understood everywhere .
But the Commission does exist to serve the Union and its peoples with high standards of performance .
That is what the public has the right to expect and it is what the people who work for the Commission want to provide and will provide .
The House will be aware , of course , that the Commission cannot fulfil these objectives alone .
All institutions in the European Union will have to face up to the issues posed by the reform and face up to them honestly and responsibly .
I know that my colleagues and I can count on the support of many Members of this House across the spectrum .
One of the biggest challenges that may come from the essential efforts to match the tasks of the Commission with the resources of the Commission will confront this House .
