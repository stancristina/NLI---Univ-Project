we need to have clear proof that the structural conditions to fight corruption and organised crime are in place in both countries , because these issues underpin society and the economy in their entirety .
Mr President , we could not have debated the budgetary discharge report at a better time than today .
Yearly , this overcharging might have yielded EUR 2.7 million .
The European Parliament should conduct a thorough inquiry to find out as soon as possible if the allegations of overcharging by the City of Strasbourg are true .
If this turns out to be the case , the European Parliament should immediately consider taking appropriate legal action against the City of Strasbourg .
I wonder how the communication policy of the City of Strasbourg – usually so prompt , cautious and even pampering towards MEPs – changed so suddenly .
We have demanded it so many times ; I think it is time for the Commission to do this .     .
It is going to go on all evening .
My second point is that I am the shadow rapporteur on the Mulder report on discharge for the Commission .
I should like to congratulate my colleague and friend , Mr Mulder , on an excellent report and I would like to point out that 80 % of money misuse is still happening in the Member States .
It is not more control we need , but better control .
Firstly , it is very important that at this stage we stick to the facts .
I do not think that is the issue right now .
It certainly looks as if it has violated the spirit of the agreement we have with the city itself .
Thirdly , we need more information .
They need to give a lot more information or they need to change their whole public relations department .
Mr President , Commissioner , I wish to continue the discussion regarding Parliament’s discharge .
Holding Parliament’s plenary part-sessions in Strasbourg costs more than EUR 200 million .
That is such a lot of money that not all of it can be easily spent .
At the end of last year , there was an EUR 85 million surplus of cash remaining in Parliament’s budget , a surplus for which a use had to be quickly thought up .
These were owned by SCI-Erasme , a Dutch pension fund , or its subsidiary .
The city of Strasbourg was therefore cashing in on the fact that Parliament had its premises in the city .
Our group supports a full and thorough investigation into this .
First , we need to work towards a genuine single market for investment products .
Second , we have to make the European investment fund industry more globally competitive .
The possible introduction of a harmonised , simplified prospectus across the EU , which would make it possible for investors to compare products easily , is one worth mentioning .
Asset management is a key tool for Europe to be able to fund its soon-to-be-explosive pensions situation .
Using existing powers under EU competition policy , rather than starting from scratch with a whole new regulatory framework , would seem to be a better way to police the market environment , which currently suffers from differences in national interpretations of key provisions of the UCITS Directive .
She made a statement comparing the European Union to the Soviet Union .
I must say that it is not a fair comparison .
Mr Prodi , the previous President of the Commission , went to Estonia before it joined the European Union .
I think Mrs Krupa should always keep that in mind when she thinks about Poland’s role in the European Union : it is there because membership is in its interests and came about through a democratic process .     .
The work we did in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs went very smoothly and most of the committee stands behind the report .
The original idea of European integration was to bring down walls , not to create them , and the Commission in its analysis and screening did an excellent job .
The second point , however , is that when we deal with this issue we have to be very careful that we do not start changing the Commission ’s exclusive right of initiative .
My third and final point is that we want increased consultation between the European Parliament and the Council as well , but it is very important to retain and keep the institutional balance pretty much as it stands .
Firstly , I agree with Mr Kirkhope that the Constitution is alive and kicking and we should be happy about it .
It is an interesting message to give to the British people .
Now we are moving to the second phase , which is analysis .
The Austrian Presidency needs to move the reflection phase on into a period of analysis and take on board Mr Méndez de Vigo’s excellent idea that there should be a study on the cost of not having a Constitution .
Finally , much like the Commissioner said , we will hopefully have a ratification phase in 2009 .
It appears that the Member States are blaming the European Parliament and the Commission for everything that goes wrong .
The idea of a joint declaration , in which the European Parliament also participates , is a good one .
If you take that example and apply it to our Chamber , with two minutes for each of the 732 MEPS , the total is 1 464 minutes .
The debates in the Council are not necessarily sexy , but we could also make improvements in this area .
You have just said that it is great that some Member States are ratifying the Treaty .
This is not a statement in view of the Ice Hockey World Championship .
