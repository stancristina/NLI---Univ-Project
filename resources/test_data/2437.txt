Directive 96/61 concerning integrated pollution prevention and control , the IPPC Directive , states that Member States must take all necessary measures that are required in order to restore industrial land that is no longer in use .
To deal with pollution that occurred in the past , certain Member States have developed special financial instruments - there are taxes or different funds that have been set up for this purpose .
The Commission is , however , not as yet planning any form of global or European clean-up strategy .
I would like to thank Commissioner Wallström for her reply .
That is actually what I was after in the question that I raised .
Commission .
In order to be able to clean up in the best way possible , we need to consider what sort of pollution is involved and what the local conditions are like .
Commission .
I think that we are already doing this when we see that there is great necessity for doing something .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I want to begin by thanking the rapporteur , Mrs García-Orcoyen Tormo , for her work on the Commission ' s proposal concerning EMAS.
The concept of best available technology , which is expressly defined in the directive relating to coordinated measures for preventing and limiting pollution , is nonetheless only relevant to industry .
This has also been noted by the European Parliament in some of its amendments .
A requirement of this kind would also be a major obstacle for small and medium-sized companies , which are not covered by the directive relating to coordinated measures for preventing and limiting pollution .
It might be said that it is a minimum requirement that environmental legislation should be respected .
EMAS is , however , a voluntary system .
How frequently is the environmental statement to be validated ?
The simplest way of building up confidence in the conclusions of the statement is to carry out regular , impartial verifications .
I am therefore afraid that , by dispensing with the principle of annual reporting in its amendments , the European Parliament may damage EMAS ' s credibility , which is a prerequisite if the new EMAS is to be successful .
The Commission is therefore delighted to be able to approve Amendments 1 , 2 and 19 ( 3 ) .
The wording ought , however , to be changed to avoid extra demands being placed upon companies , particularly upon small and medium-sized companies .
The Commission is therefore able to approve Amendment 16 in principle , if it is extended to include all information and not only data .
A small addendum is required , however , so that the Commission is able , in a legally correct manner , to comply with the contractual conditions in the agreement that has been entered into with the European Standardisation Organisation .
An important aspect of the proposal is the extension of EMAS ' s area of application to include all sectors of trade and industry .
Those amendments which relate only to the industrial sector cannot , therefore , be approved .
The Commission cannot , therefore , approve Amendments 7 , 8 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 14 , 15 , 19 , 21 , 23 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 31 , 33 ( 1 ) , 34 , 35 , 37 , 41 , 42 , 47 , 48 , 49 and 50 .
Nor can the Commission accept Amendments 39 and 40 , because the EMAS logo must be a sign of excellence for organisations , at the same time as it must not lead to confusion on the part of the public .
The Commission is convinced that the European Parliament ' s amendments have , in both readings , contributed greatly to this review and increased EMAS ' s potential for helping improve the environmental performance of trade and industry throughout the Union .
The limit values which have been set for benzene and carbon monoxide in ambient air are based upon the World Health Organisation ' s latest recommendations and are aimed at achieving a high level of protection of people ' s health throughout the Union .
As you perhaps know , the Commission has now , in the course of the week , adopted a new directive which will further improve access to environmental information .
In order for the Commission to be able to approve Amendment 3 ( 1 ) , the latter must therefore be substantially reworded .
The review will form part of the first report on the new integrated programme for clean air , which the Commission is in the process of drawing up .
I turn finally to Amendment 4 , which concerns an important issue .
Moreover , a concentration of 10 g/m3 must not be exceeded during that period .
According to Amendment 4 , the clause ought not to be there , something which could jeopardise the agreement with the Council .
Mr President , Commissioner , I live in the middle of the Nordic forests , which form part of the enormous area of Europe covered by forests .
The forests of Europe are very , very different from one another .
Unfortunately , we cannot prevent pollution by means of forest policy but only by means of environmental , traffic and agricultural policy , in short through general environmental policy .
To obtain environmental certification , the owners of the forests have to burn down a certain area of them each year .
They have to be warmed up by a fire in order to grow .
