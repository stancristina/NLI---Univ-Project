to be able to set clear targets for the ecological pillar to make this monitoring possible .
The faith of citizens in the European Central Bank is primarily based on price stability .
It is important to citizens that the currency is stable and that the real level of earnings and purchasing power remain unchanged .
Transparency goes without saying for national central banks , and should also be the case for the European Central Bank .
Our citizens expect us to do all we can to ensure a smooth transition to the euro .
The euro will not fail due to practical problems encountered during a transitional period of two or three weeks .
A strong economy , healthy business structures and a functioning internal market are vital prerequisites for the trust of citizens and the global competitiveness of the Union .
In this context I would also like to mention my concern regarding the fate of the Directive on Takeovers to be addressed tomorrow .
After much wrangling , the European Parliament and the Council have managed to reach an agreement through the conciliation procedure .
Open coordination is naturally a positive thing and I warmly support it .
Mr President , it is very good to hear that the Commissioner is not afraid of a trade war but responds very positively to the idea that these important political aims set by the European Parliament , for example , such as a ban on the marketing of cosmetic products tested on animals , are political decisions , not a question of protectionism , and thus it is important that our representatives defend these issues at international level .
Has there been any discussion on this ?
The European Investment Bank has also stated that it will take competition concerns over mobile phone networks into account when deciding whether to finance third-generation projects .
Mr President , it is always good to put the final question at question time .
I was very pleased that the Commission takes a positive view of network sharing .
You also referred to the Commission possibly providing specific guidelines on this issue , should the need arise .
The sustainability of pensions will be one of the biggest challenges which our societies will have to face in the coming decades .
Occupational retirement provisions will play an important role in this connection in many Member States .
I will concentrate on that issue .
Citizens should not be forced to pay twice for cover they do not need .
Compounded over a 40-year savings period this could significantly reduce overall scheme returns .
Fourthly , I fully agree with some of the previous speakers .
If we want to promote the second pillar we need to get employers excited about the new rules .
Finally , I say to Mr Kuckelkorn that we cannot secure something which does not exist .
Other renewable sources of energy are difficult to find .
Parliament is sticking to its target of twelve percent of gross energy consumption being produced by renewable energy by 2010 , but this is not far away , so achieving this target may be wishful thinking .
The lack of funding for the Altener Programme indicates that the EU is not playing a major role in achieving this target .
As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism , I would like to emphasise the importance of the transport sector and the equal rights of each means of transport to use radio frequencies for operational purposes , above all to ensure passenger safety .
Some of the amendments put forward by our committee were adopted by the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy while others were not .
Amendment No 25 concerns transparency .
The publication of information on the use of frequencies is important but publication is only beneficial if the information published includes all the data necessary for the effective use of this information .
The annex to the proposal for a decision is too general and apparently confuses reserving the use of frequencies for different purposes with allocating frequencies to users .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mrs Niebler for her excellent report .
In some Member States there were no charges at all , while others used hybrid systems .
Because radio waves transcend borders , it is clear that we need common European principles to administer them since , to put it bluntly , fifteen different interpretations of the same thing is a barrier to marketing .
The Electronic Europe strategy demands that everyone should be included on equal terms .
At the same time , cultural diversity should be encouraged and in this regard I mean , for example , public radio broadcasting , which must be given the necessary frequencies .
I think that this will see us achieve a balance in these sub-areas and gain an understanding of what is important and what is business .
I too would especially like to thank Angelika Niebler for her report .
Today , following discussion in the committee , the issue is having its first reading in the European Parliament .
The timing is ideal , since , after much discussion , the Council , for its part , last week reached consensus on the new text which largely confirms the Commission ' s original aims .
Despite this , the Commission has some detailed observations on various parts of the report .
Some amendments propose that all the decisions should be made by the codecision procedure , in other words that this procedure be adopted in agreeing the Community ' s common policy and also in agreeing such technical implementation measures required in order to comply with the policies agreed .
In the view of the Commission , this conflicts with the Comitology Decision
