between the governments of the different Member States must be the main tool for resolving problems , especially in the case of neighbouring States .
Mr President , in this case you have done justice to your talent and reputation .
We would ask the Members to examine these amendments , and if we reach an agreement on them , the Group of the European People 's Party , in accordance with the reasoning we have given , will be able to vote in favour of this extremely important report on which it is my honour to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Napolitano .
If somebody has to apply and transpose legislation in accordance with this principle , then logically they must also be able to defend their prerogatives and rights .
The European Union itself , on the contrary , lacks a comprehensive approach to the issue of stateless nations .
Mr President , by local powers , we all understand the same thing , but when it comes to regional powers , there are different types of regional powers in Europe , some with recognised legislative powers .
Mr President , Commissioner , I am saying nothing new when I insist that diversity is one of the characteristic principles of the united Europe we are building .
Even if all the regions were constitutional , however , the need to design a European institutional architecture which has room for all of them , in which they all have their place under the European sun , would be all the greater .
This participation and will , if recognised by the future Constitution , would not represent a free concession , but a right of the regions , such as Catalonia , which the European Union , and this Parliament in particular , as the representative of the European people , must respect if it really wants to listen to the citizens .
Mr President , I would firstly like to welcome this report and thank the rapporteur for her work and I would also like to welcome what Commissioner Vitorino said in relation to the procedure to be followed in order to be able to hold a genuine annual debate on human rights in the European Union .
I would point out to Mr Cornillet that this report has always been controversial .
The UNHCR also expresses its concern at the increasing tendency to link asylum seekers to possible crime and terrorism , particularly following 11 September .
Therefore the proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , in December 2000 , was an unprecedented event in terms of the recognition of a Union which is increasingly close to the citizens and sensitive to their needs .
The rules which regulate the free movement of persons within the Union are Community rules .
I agree with the notion that there is room to better guarantee both the freedom of security of those people who are in Community territory and the situation of those who wish to pass through it .
The four proposals we are going to debate today fall within the framework of this process .
We must also deal with domestic transport .
The creation of an internal market in rail services would not be possible without the establishment of common safety rules .
Furthermore , the opening up of the markets and the end of the monopolies considerably modify such an important factor as the system of responsibilities in the field of safety , and it is therefore necessary to establish a coherent , transparent and clear framework which prevents any doubt in this area .
We cannot just remove administrative borders , but we must also remove technological borders in order to create this European rail network .
Mr President , to conclude , the texts proposed intend , on the one hand , to ensure that 15 incompatible national systems develop technically towards an integrated and competitive European rail area and , on the other , to speed up the opening up of the market in freight transport , so that operators can provide effective services in any part of the Union .
I would ask the Commission to inform us regularly and periodically on all these issues .
Ladies and gentlemen , to those of you who love the railways so much that they want nothing to be done , all I can say is that over the years we have seen what is taking place : the railways are disappearing .
Secondly , we argue that there should be competition between the various operators .
We are talking about introducing rationality into the rail sector and turning it into a rail sector which is European and appropriate for the twenty-first century .
This opening up should therefore be considered not only from the point of view of the contracts signed by public administrations - something already regulated by the proposed regulations on public service obligations , which is still awaiting the decision of the Council , since Parliament gave its opinion on them some time ago - but also from the point of view of access rights and the protection of passenger rights .
We do not therefore accept Amendment No 56 .
I would like to thank Mr Savary for the improvements he contributes through his proposals .
In order to update the rules , exemptions and exceptions have been reduced to the minimum and have been restricted to small and light vehicles , those used for short distances and those which offer a public service .
On the basis of Mr Markov 's proposals , and with his cooperation , the report has developed , leading to greater flexibility for the driver , because it is the driver who is aware of levels of tiredness at any given moment and it must be they who call the shots in terms of rests and the distribution of working time .
