Institutional issues are not of interest to many people , because they are complicated issues .
Mr Gorostiaga , you are a disgrace to this Parliament .
He was always fighting for dialogue , he desired dialogue .
I , like Mr Patten this afternoon , am not going to comment on the whole of the European Union ' s external action , but I would just like to concentrate on three points which I believe deserve to be highlighted .
I wonder - I will ask Mr Patten this question when the time comes - whether the directives for negotiation which the European Union and the Commission are currently debating with Chile and Mercosur , adopted in light of the Seattle Summit , should be revised , given the failings of that summit , and whether it would be discriminatory to conclude these agreements on the condition that a new round of the WTO should take place .
While each report deals with the aspects which concern each committee , there is a common element amongst the four : they all express a generally favourable opinion of the proposals for reform presented by the Commission in its White Paper , although at the same time they remain vigilant with regard to their implementation and development .
The Directors-General will have responsibility for the internal control of their directorates-general , without in any way exempting the respective Commissioners from their own political responsibility with regard to the functioning of the services and that includes , where appropriate , the President of the Commission .
Compared to the great efficiency that it demonstrates with regard to appropriations managed directly by the Commission , its weakness with regard to decentralised operational costs is notable .
They have the duty to get it right and to take risks , not to avoid them .
Therefore , any tendency of the Commission reform to covertly remove from Parliament this ability to control administrative expenditure would create interinstitutional problems in the short term .
Nevertheless , we will give the Commission our vote of confidence so that it can give as much detail as possible about the scope of its proposal .
We must remember that the crisis in the Commission was not caused by any failing in the Community ' s administration but by political problems which had little to do with the functioning of the administration , and any desire to link the crisis in the Commission with the malfunctioning of its administration would be arbitrary .
However , we feel that we ought to respect two fundamental principles ; one , the recognition of situations that are recognised in law ; the so-called acquired rights of officials and secondly , the principle of stability , of guarantee , and even the right to union membership , the right to the defence , by officials , of their post , their career and even their professional prestige .
We are therefore dealing with one of those challenges that are occasionally faced by politicians who must find the best way to safeguard the governability of institutions , as well as the best way to provide the citizens with a good administration .
In our opinion , that is , the opinion of the Socialist Group and that of the whole of the Development Committee , the development policy is an essential policy within the framework of Community external action , which must respond to the problems of today ' s world , of which the greatest and most dramatic is underdevelopment .
It sounds absurd , but in fact what the Commission is proposing is absurd : that you take charge of implementing measures designed by others for certain countries considered to be developing , and of designing and implementing policies for the ACP countries .
These latter aspects particularly effect the NGOs .
We remind the Member States that there is no place in European construction for temptations to renationalise ; on the contrary , it is time to defend the European dimension of this policy by contributing to its rationalisation .
If the European Union wishes to fully implement its policy of solidarity and finally eradicate poverty and its causes , we must begin to reassess the Union ' s actions and the approach it should adopt towards its development aid policy , with a view to improving the effectiveness of those efforts .
Furthermore , however , in Mrs Sauquillo ' s report we draw attention to certain measures within the reforms proposed by the Commission , which we consider to be mistaken .
With this in mind , and in order to remove the obvious differences that exist on an international level between the various classification societies in terms of the competence of their inspectors , the level of development of their IT resources and the degree of technical requirements in their inspections , the Commission has presented us with a proposal to amend Directive 94/57/EC which will apply to all vessels , including those transporting oil products , and which establishes the rules that the Member States , and the classification societies authorised by them , should comply with .
On the one hand , it is stipulated that the classification societies must have their own system of internal audits in order to measure the quality of their services in all the locations where they work , as well as clear rules for the responsibility and monitoring of all its branches and staff .
However , the Commission has already announced a second package on maritime safety , which will propose a system of responsibility for all the parties implicated in accidents : shipowners , the owners of the cargo , classification societies , etc .
Public opinion is demanding that we act swiftly in this situation , as the President-in-Office of the Council has said , but that speed needs to be compatible with an acceptable minimum text .
So
