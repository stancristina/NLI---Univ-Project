It is the fight of the peoples itself which will get them out of poverty and lead them to development .
There have previously been similar attacks in Nablous , Toulkarem , Salfit , Kalkilia and Jenin .
This development comes just 18 months after the Nuclear Post Review calling for ways to be found so that nuclear weapons can be used within the framework of the new American preventive strike strategy .
The eight are concerned not for the poor and how they live , but with how to stop them rising up against them , against miserable exploitation and injustice , which is why they also took harsher repressive measures , preventing thousands of protestors from coming to express their opposition to the globalisation of capital and their predatory exploitation .
The Presidency and the Commission must make a statement to the House both on the content of the discussions in which they participated and on the repressive measures taken against the protestors , the same and perhaps worse measures that are also being taken for the European Council in Thessaloniki .
The proposed restructuring only benefits the strong monopoly groups and has adverse repercussions on the cost to the average family , national energy planning and the position of the workers in this specific sector .
At the same time , it safeguards high profitability by passing the new financial burdens on to the average family , while the increase in exports will limit the development of generating stations in the weaker Member States in order to make use of domestic energy sources .
The policy of promoting not just cheap labour but cheaper and cheaper labour , which the amendments by the PPE-DE will bring about , is a non starter because , while it brings about a gradual reduction in the standard of living , it also facilitates the survival of companies with low productivity and little growth capacity , as the rapporteur also rightly underlines .
It would be a pity if the PPE-DE stood by its initial choices which , instead of resulting in the exploitation of the competitiveness of quality , which is the advantage of the European economy , insist on more and more exploitation of cheap labour .
Mr President , I wish to say that it is indeed infuriating that the Council is absent from a debate such as this , especially when the European Parliament had already given the Council advance warning during the previous Plenary .
The United States are exporting them to us and we , with no shame whatsoever and , unfortunately , with a Greek Presidency , are importing them under these agreements .
Please explain it to us in terms we can understand .
At the same time , by making not only relative but also absolute cuts in wages and linking them to productivity , cutbacks in the welfare state and social protection and the non-application of what are inadequate safety regulations in the workplace are being promoted .
The proposed measures are essentially measures to reinforce the unaccountability of big business by granting it new privileges .
.
It is disseminating its own version of terrorism , it is imposing special clauses in association agreements , while it has not a single word to say about Israeli state terrorism .
They were and are a vehicle for intervention in the internal affairs of Mediterranean countries , in the aim of supporting the economic , military and political interests of the ?U.
This policy will be stepped up given that , following enlargement , the ? U 's attention is turning towards the Mediterranean .
Even the debate on this issue , just a few days after the criminal invasion of Iraq by the British and American forces , constitutes provocation .
It does not result in any differentiation in the domestic law of the USA , such as the repeal of the death penalty or the discriminatory provisions in the 'patriotic law ' which deny non-US citizens legal aid , changes to the legislation of states in the USA which are incompatible with European law , or an end to the inhumane detention of prisoners of war , including citizens of Member States of the EU in Guant√°namo .
Thus , negotiations to close this dossier were one of the main objectives of the Greek Presidency , in cooperation of course with the European Commission and the European Parliament .
The push towards reaching an agreement was reinforced at the Council on 26 and 27 May , when Commissioner Fischler and I met each minister in order to identify basic problems and possible solutions and reach an honest compromise .
The European Parliament is a particularly important factor in the procedure to formulate the future common agricultural policy .
This consistency on the part of the European Parliament , and especially the Agriculture Committee , will allow the House to give its opinion on the European Commission 's proposals in good time , thereby enabling our Council to pursue an honest and sincere compromise .
This is without doubt the core of reform .
The view expressed by certain members of our Council with so-called partial decoupling is also particularly important .
Second issue : modulation .
In other words , because agricultural resources are specific , any increase in the franchise or any other similar arrangement must not jeopardise either the funding of future reforms in dairy products , sugar or Mediterranean products or the financial ceiling .
Consequently , our efforts must tend towards finding ways which will allow demands to be restricted to the absolutely necessary , and making provision for greater flexibility in the Member States , with the possible gradual application of the proposed system .
At sectoral level , the European Commission 's proposals need improving so that the Council can adopt them within the framework of an overall package .
