Iraq must pull itself together .
When they report to the Security Council again in a few weeks ' time , it will be the UN Security Council that will take decisions on what is to happen next .
I am convinced that they are doing so with good intentions , but this will be exploited by the Iraqi dictator to reinforce the image of disharmony in the international community .
I would advise strongly against making this journey .
He believed that would show not only the USA and the world at large , but also Iraq , that the weapons inspections are not something thought up by the USA , but the only way to achieve peace ; and it would show that the weapons inspectors have strong support , even among us pacifists and opponents of war .
I think that is very sad .
Ladies and gentlemen , we have to have an international legal system and not revert to a cross between the Middle Ages and the Wild West .
War can never be the right way to destroy weapons of mass destruction or combat terrorism .
Millions of people would be forced to flee - refugees that the neighbouring countries cannot take care of .
The war with Iraq is not about Saddam Hussein 's dictatorship or breaches of UN resolutions .
Only the Security Council can make decisions on this .
There is no justification for Saddam Hussein 's devastating politics .

The principles of the Århus Convention are very important , because the environment does not have its own vote , so to speak .
The details are left in the hands of the Member States , however .
These two directives are now being supplemented with provisions on public participation and access to justice in accordance with the Århus Convention .
The directive also contains provisions on reviewing the legality of decisions that fall within the scope of the provisions .
( SV ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , it is good that we have reached agreement on this directive : it forms an important part of our overall strategy of reducing air pollution and the emission of greenhouse gases .
Directive 98/70/EC will enable us to ensure that the sale of leaded petrol is phased out .
That is why it is so important to phase in zero-sulphur fuels .
I would therefore thank the rapporteur , Mrs Hautala , and all the Members who have contributed to the adoption of this act .
These three diseases are different by nature , and different types of effort are required to prevent them and cure people of them .
We in Parliament have for many years demanded that the Commission should increase its efforts in the health sphere .
It provides the framework for the way in which the programme of measures is to be implemented .
Large parts of the Commission 's proposal for a regulation are constructive .
Vigorous endeavours to prevent these diseases cannot take place in a vacuum .
The same naturally applies to coordination with those working in the area of reproductive health and family planning .
Calculations have shown that ten billion dollars a year would be required in order effectively to combat these three diseases .
What counts , of course , is what is needed for doing the actual work on combating disease .
I am convinced that we must soon discuss further contributions to this work , and mainly the issue of 'fresh ' new money .
I myself was recently in Kenya and saw how badly just one poor country had been hit by these problems .
Rather , we are now seeing a rapid spread of disease in countries such as India and China too .
After just 20 years , more than 40 million people have now already been affected .
Mr President , thank you , Commissioner Lamy , for an interesting introduction to this discussion .
I amused myself the other day by looking up the word 'globalisation ' in a dictionary from the beginning of the 1990s .
It is hardly a case of being in favour of , or against , a market economy .
First of all , poverty and the situation of the poorest countries .
That is something we must do , too , but , in the case of countries that have almost nothing but raw materials to offer on the market , it is difficult to see their being able in the long term to provide themselves with a stable foundation if we do not , in a quite different way , help them to develop and build up their capacity .
A second issue is the whole set of problems in connection with the environment .
Commissioner , I am afraid that we are doing much too little to try to help promote technological advance in the poor countries .
These are just a couple of proposals for giving some focus to this debate on globalisation and its framework , rules and basic conditions .
It is only just over a week since Parliament , at first reading , voted by a large majority in favour of a new regulation on combating HIV , malaria and tuberculosis in the poor countries of the world .
We had been working on this issue for almost a year .
The reason for this is , of course , that a great many pharmaceutical companies see no real profitability in this type of research .
Another problem touched upon in the debate was the current imbalance within TRIPS and the WTO when it comes to the possibility , in special situations , of having recourse to what are known as compulsory licences .
The countries most dependent upon these exemption rules in the TRIPS Agreement are now in a position in which they are being discriminated against .
If we are
