This saying is just as topical and important in modern times .
The gender dimension must be also taken into account in the education of and information for nursing staff .
The serious psychological problems they face must qualify for both our development and our humanitarian aid and , in general terms , aid to reconstruct areas , because the reconstruction of areas requires above all reconstruction of the human psyche .     – Mr President , first I should like to welcome both the honesty and courage of Commissioner Rehn on the Council 's stand on the 2007 budget .
We all believe in and support a peaceful , democratic , multiethnic and European Kosovo .
The European Union should not repeat the mistakes it made in the 1990s .
From this point of view , the Council 's decision to suspend negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement is , I think , an important political mistake for the European Union .
I close with the situation regarding minority rights in Kosovo .
We must , at long last , move in this direction .     – Madam President , the ugly situation and impoverishment of the peoples of the Former Yugoslavia are the result of foreign intervention , the unfair and dirty war unleashed by ΝΑΤΟ with the participation of numerous countries of the European Union .
Today you are not even abiding by the pronouncements and the commitments you made not to proceed to an independent Kosovo .
It is a fact that the signature of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement opens a new path for Albania towards Europe , towards the European institutions , with the ultimate objective of integration into the European family .
On the question of combating corruption , we are of course all agreed .
This is very important , because it will help to smooth out political life and consolidate a democratic political system .
This too is an issue which we need to highlight .
Finally , respect for minorities .
There has not been one spokesman from any of the wings who has not referred to Albania as a country in which crime is flourishing , in which there are numerous smugglers , in which children are trafficked .
I shall start with what Mr Rehn said : that the Commission and the Council are in accord .
I say this in order to restore the truth and set the record straight .
When the peoples of eastern Europe were looking upon Stalin as a dictator , Albania thought he was very democratic and followed Mao Tse Tung .
Sixteen years later , in a European country , a country , Minister , just 500 kilometres from Austria .
We are talking about a country that last year – not before then , just last year – took two months to return the results of the elections .
There are Greek companies which have invested several million euros and , precisely because they could not stand the mafia which imposed its own extortionate taxes , they are abandoning their building sites and machinery and moving out .
I agree that we must all try to help this country find its way , but if we believe that it is mature , then I greatly fear that we shall find ourselves in trouble .
So Mrs Ponte comes along and dictates which country will accede and which will not accede to the European Union .
Now , a short while ago , the Commissioner made a stylish but material admission that this is the reason Serbia is not joining the European Union .
In 2006 we have trafficking in children , for goodness sake .
When a country is deprived of the freedom of the press , it is deprived of basic rights .
The motion for a resolution by the European Parliament formulates the facts , listing the shortcomings and describing the prospects .
The challenge of the somewhat new dynamic relations between the European Union and Albania consists in the gradual qualitative adaptation of Albania to the of principles , values , rules and conduct .
Within the framework of the required adjustment , administrative , police and judicial modernisation in order to combat organised crime and corruption , the greatest possible participation of civil society in the political process and the establishment of viable and transparent mechanisms for the operation of the market economy are vying for first place .
As a deviation , an from the debate on the subject of Albania and link with the previous debate on Kosovo , I should like to put a clear question to Commissioner Rehn , the guardian of Community legality , as a member of the Commission : There is the recognised principle of respect for human rights .
If we isolate Albania , we condemn it to remain a state in which and from which crime and corruption flourish and are exported .
That is why we are signing the Stabilisation and Association Agreement in question .
The first is compliance on the part of Albania with the provisions of the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of National Minorities .
The second issue concerns the census of the population , an objective census of the population which will adequately record the size of the minorities and not give rise to doubts as to its accuracy .
It is the responsibility of the European Commission to put what is contained in the text into practice with pressure on and cooperation with the Albanian authorities .     . – The Greek Communist Party voted against the report on the European social model , the product of the agreement between the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats and the social democrats , reveals in the most cynical manner the nightmarish future being prepared by euro-unifying capital for the workers .
The only thing that will remain
