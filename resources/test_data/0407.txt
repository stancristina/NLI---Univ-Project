The fraud that was actually identified was of very little significance : a small amount , most of which has been cleared up , and the problem of the tiny sum still requiring clarification is currently being resolved in collaboration with a former Committee member .
It is the fruit of the labour and cooperation of most of the Committee on Budgetary Control .
Firstly , the fact that the rules on exchanges of information , which have been in place since the beginning of this parliamentary term , have not been implemented .
It will also be the time when we will be able to plug certain gaps in our knowledge , which we hope will be filled in by OLAF .     – Mr President , we now come to the follow-up report on the 2001 discharges which contains many interesting points and which constitutes an excellent piece of work on the part of the rapporteur , Mr Casaca .
I also believe the internal reform of the Commission needs to be reviewed .
There will also be a phase of considering the opportunities for moving into the international market .
There is no doubt that this debate is taking place , among other reasons , because of the Commission ’s communication on the textile industry in the context of an enlarged Europe , for which I want to thank the Commission .
Finally , it is very important that the Commission implement the proposed measures on protecting intellectual property rights .
In response to the idiotic criticism of those people who believe this to be idealism , we could reply that values are interests .
I believe that it is no exaggeration whatsoever to state that , today , history is blending with the present , and that in this historic present which we are living in , the European Union and United Nations are two principal actors .
Moreover , either we stop voting in the United Nations differently 60 times out of every 100 , or we will have to abandon once and for all the European Union 's aspirations to be on the path to shared world leadership .
Under these circumstances , a vote in favour of the amendment would imply that we had full knowledge of the facts and that as a result we were passing judgment in terms of certain responsibilities .
Therefore , Secretary-General , I would like to reaffirm the importance of solidarity and close cooperation between peoples and nations .
The directive also indicates the maximum weekly working time of 48 hours , although it allows it to be calculated as an average over a reference period of four months .
My report refers exclusively to the re-examination of these two exceptions in order to respond not with waffle , but with clarity , to the question the Directive obliges us to ask : 10 years after its adoption , does it make sense to maintain the extension of the reference periods ?
I hope that tomorrow we can continue working and bringing positions closer together .
Opting-out is not a flexible rule : it is the absence of rules .
Clearly , a consequence of extending the reference periods would be to increase the flexibility available to companies .
Mr President , the fundamental objective of the CAP is to guarantee a fair standard of living for the agricultural population .
He essentially proposes that the Sixth and Seventh Framework Programme for Research should change in accordance with this new situation .
For all of these reasons , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur once again and ask the Commissioner to change this approach as soon as possible and allocate the funds requested today by the European Parliament .     Mr President , Commissioner – whose presence we are grateful for – ladies and gentlemen , I would like to begin by congratulating our rapporteur , Mr Souchet , on the wonderful report he has presented to us , on an issue which was not at all easy – Northern hake .
The combination of these two aspects is something fundamental which we hope will be taken into account in the future .
When we move on to the analysis of the measures proposed , we discover that the Commission is not taking account of the best scientific information available , nor is it dispelling the doubts of the fisheries industry , since once again there has been no dialogue with the scientists and the proposal has been drawn up without the serious participation of professionals .
What Mr Souchet proposes in his report , namely the replacement of this recovery plan with a multi-annual management plan , is the result not just of the – I believe correct – analysis of the European Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries and of our own debate , but also of the guidelines already defined by the European Parliament itself and Mr Souchet in relation to the management of fragile stocks : the application of simple and flexible rules , such as multi-annual TACs , rather than rigid systems with uncertain effects , such as measures based on the fishing effort .     Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur and thank him for his attitude towards the amendments I have proposed .
A scientific study is therefore needed , as well as the opinion of the new regional advisory councils provided for in the reform of the common fisheries policy .
In this respect , I must condemn the fact that in recent years there has been a reduction in actual Community expenditure , payment appropriations in relation to the gross national income , while the latter is decreasing in constant terms due to inflation .
This Parliament has already set out its position on three aspects
