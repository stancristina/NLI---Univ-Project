Mr President , Commissioner , what does the Commission intend to do about the threat that the digital divide will increase , because it affects people who are also financially badly off ?
Secondly , the usage rate of Internet connections amongst us in Europe is low .
Thirdly , the development of content here in Europe is also slow .
To this must of course be added other types of fraud , and all the fraudulent transactions that remained undetected .
Carousel Fraud means the acquisition of goods without paying the VAT as required under the rules of the internal market .
It is characterised by a chain of invoices , with or without goods , extending across one or more borders .
Carousel Fraud generally concerns small items of value , such as computers and mobile phones .
In order to streamline the current legislative framework , the Commission has now put forward a proposal for a regulation that would considerably enhance and improve current forms of administrative cooperation in the field of VAT.
At present , all communication must go through central liaison offices , meaning that all requests pass through one country ' s administrative machinery from a local office to a national liaison office and down the same path in the other country .
I agree with the Commission that cooperation at local level would improve mutual understanding regarding requests for information , would increase the motivation of tax inspectors , and would avoid wasting the few resources that exist .
I therefore wholeheartedly support the Commission proposal , which should be seen as a major step forward in the fight against fraud .
The Commission , however , could have gone still further to speed up cooperation and increase flexibility .
For the same reason , to speed up the exchange of information , that is , more room for manoeuvre should be given to the local authorities with regard to language policy .
There is one point , however , where the Commission proposal goes too far .
This aspect of the matter would therefore be better addressed by an amendment to the Data Protection directive and at this stage it should be left to the Member States to consider whether or not to pursue this line of action .
Finally , something should be said about the legal basis .
I agree with the Commission ' s view that this proposal should concern administrative cooperation only and must be dealt with according to the procedure laid down in Article 95 .
The legal situation will thus be cleared up soon .
Madam President , Commissioner , I have no hesitation in adding to those words of thanks that have gone to Commissioner Monti and Mr Rapkay , as rapporteur .
For that reason , reductions in state aid and effective monitoring strengthen the competitiveness of the European economy and thus boost economic growth and the creation of jobs .
At the Stockholm European Council the Member States renewed their commitment to reduce state aid as a proportion of GNP .
This commitment must be kept to .
We in Parliament have time and time again called for action that would guarantee greater transparency in this area .
To make an accurate analysis possible we need more detailed information on the use aid is put to and the sectors and companies that receive aid .
In this respect I agree fully with what my colleague , Mrs Riis-JÃ¸rgensen , said about the shipbuilding industry , which is also a major sector from the point of view of Finland , my country .
There has been good progress made recently in that area by the Council .
It is clear , however , that new and permanent jobs will not be created by trying to maintain dilapidated structures .
Against certain legal advice , we are now , however , satisfied that our opinion on this matter is being heard , and this is because we have said how important it is to have the Protocol ratified at long last .
I would like to add my thanks to those expressed here both to the rapporteur and the Commissioner .
It is important to realise that a good number of companies have already become aware of just how much potential there is for business in policies on climate .
We must also have confidence in this and include the United States in the process .
It may actually be , as my country ' s Minister of the Environment has said in this connection , that the USA will become the last open-air museum of the old technology unless it joins in these efforts .
This spring the European Parliament can now participate with determination in drafting the rules of this directive on emissions trading .
Mr President , the working environment of the UN Commission on Human Rights has been described as a sea of sorrows that knows no shores .
The United States having failed to join the Commission last year , the EU is now the flagship of the Western European Group in Geneva .
For that reason it is especially important that the Union should have an integrated policy based on clear geographical and thematic priorities , which does not grope about in the dark so much as it once did .
This should not be allowed to become just a rhetorical commitment .
The representatives of the Commission also brought their input to the discussion .
The forthcoming enlargement is a major challenge , and it will also bring pressure for reform in the administration of regional policy and the Structural Funds .
The purpose of this report is to analyse the problems of practical implementation and put forward proposals on how the operation of the Structural Funds might be improved within the framework of the existing rules and what facts should be taken into account in preparing the next reform
