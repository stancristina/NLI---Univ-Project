The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has decided to apply the precautionary principle in this matter and propose that the directive cover all hardwood trees .
For example , there is still no scientific evidence to suggest that there is any danger of cancer with Finland 's main industrial timber types : pine , spruce , and birch .
We nonetheless have to remember that possible carcinogenicity is not the only problem with wood dust .
In many countries that will not mean any change at all to the situation that already exists .
Our committee , however , agreed to the high limit value once it had received an assurance from the Commission that the value would be amended downwards .
If the health of workers is to be protected at the workplace , there must be an assurance that people at work are in no way exposed to carcinogens .
Now that wood dust is covered in the directive on carcinogens we can only hope that the Commission will produce new proposals as speedily as possible to supplement this directive and lower the limit values set .
Its use is allowed in Belgium , for example .
Asbestos is a notoriously dangerous material .
During the first years of the new millennium more than ten thousand people will die from diseases caused by it , mainly lung cancer , every year .
Why has this not been done ?
If the Commission allows its continued use in new applications , national bans will no longer be able to prevent the importation of machinery and equipment that pose a risk in terms of asbestos .
In addition , certain manufacturers use asbestos as a competitive tool against safe but more expensive substitutes .
The experience of many countries over many years should vouch for the use of substitute materials .
For example , there is one in the Finnish version .
The new situation , in other words the fact that the decision of the Bureau is to come into force , will not improve matters as we had hoped , but on the contrary will confuse things even further .
Madam President , Council Regulation ( EEC ) No 2080/92 was a flanking measure introduced as part of the 1992 CAP reform .
Its main aim was to organise afforestation as an alternative use of agricultural land , so that surpluses in agricultural produce , which are politically and economically harmful to the Community , could be reduced .
At the same time the Community would improve its stock of afforested land , while restoring the ecological balance in its efforts to combat the greenhouse effect .
Community co-financing in the Objective 1 area is 75 % , and 50 % elsewhere .
The report states that agricultural land has been reduced in three countries by around 0.95 % to 1.35 % , and in other countries the amount is noticeably less .
As rapporteur for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in this matter , however , I am asking for a proper evaluation to be made on the implementation and viability of the scheme .
In my opinion , the Court of Auditors should submit a report to Parliament of the costs and benefits arising from the Council Regulation so that we can get a comprehensive picture of the viability of a scheme that has paid out billions of ecus in the European Union .
My colleague , Mr Iversen , has produced an excellent report on the latter .
In practice the regulation has had a significant effect in four Member States : Spain , the United Kingdom , Ireland and Portugal , which account for 81 % of the total EU hectarage quoted , or approximately 500 000 hectares .
It seems odd that the Commission should have wished to produce this activity report at such an early stage and with insufficient information .
This , however , is not an indication that the costs of the scheme were any less than was believed , but that generally the scheme had not worked and does not work as programmed .
I believe we are entitled to enquire whether the action the regulation calls for should continue in the way it now does , as the desired aims , with few exceptions , have not been achieved .
The European Parliament adopted a resolution on forest strategy in the Community in January 1997 , which states that forest policy is not mentioned in the Treaty of Rome and therefore does not fall within the jurisdiction of the Community .
There is a heated debate going on at this very moment at EU level on a possible forestry strategy and the different systems of certification there are with forests .
Madam President , Commissioner , congratulations to my colleague on an excellent report .
Environmental aid in the future can also be used to lessen the burden production places on the environment .
Environmental protection and sustained development are becoming ever more important to consumers when they choose the food they buy .
The European Union will only succeed in the global food market in the area of high-quality produce .
Sustainable use of the forests , and their reform , have been the backbone of our economy for decades .
EU action is needed to ensure , for example , that WTO negotiations cover the free access of the timber industry 's products to global markets .
Proposals on this have already been put to you , Commissioner , and I would like to ask you this : when will you come up with a proposal for such an umbrella scheme ?
Mr Santini 's report deals comprehensively with the special problems of mountain areas .
The European Union can function in a sustainable way only by acknowledging differences , and taking greater notice of the different needs of the regions .
Madam President , Commissioner , it is absolutely vital to discuss
