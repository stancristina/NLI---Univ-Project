The European Parliament has shown an enormous sense of responsibility , which our group values highly .
There are more funds available to cover outstanding commitments under categories 2 to 4 , and there is a common call to use them to clear arrears .
The reform of the Commission proceeds , and any expenditure that should not in fact arise , has been cut .
In the first reading of the budget some cuts were made to external actions , such as the western Balkans CARDS programme .
Furthermore , the CARDS programme had already been given 63 million euros out of this year ' s budget transfers , so all in all the programme is returning to what was proposed in the Council ' s draft budget .
Of these , 105 are in reserve , and our group hopes that at least the majority of them may still be released .
Thirty million euros are to be spent on solving border problems associated with new Member States , with a further 15 million being spent on this next year .
Our group supports all these decisions .
Mr President , I actually have a further question .
Since the Erika disaster , we have had several projects in Europe that have aimed to improve environmental legislation with regard to oil tankers .
I also share the view of Mr Cashman that Parliament cannot approve the secretaries-general carrying on discussions of these matters in the name of the politicians , since transparency is , as a basic question of democracy , a highly political matter .
Now we must also look at what will be our future challenges once ( hopefully ) all these open questions with regard to this Regulation are resolved .
I would like to mention some of these .
Otherwise , there will be no democratic responsibility of any kind as far as these matters are concerned .
Certainly we must protect personal data , but we cannot approve a situation where ( for example ) the names and personal details of representatives of industry who are taking part in Commission negotiations can be kept secret in the name of data protection .
Mr President , my colleagues , on behalf of my group I thank the rapporteurs for the preparation of their fine reports , and also for the good outcomes in conciliation .
These statutory proposals belonging to the " Erika I " package contain essential measures for the increasing of marine safety .
In the case of the classification societies , the Community 's authority needs to be increased with regard to the approval and control of these societies .
Extended inspections must be directed specifically at vessels which represent a risk .
The port control directive will improve the uniformity and effectiveness of the inspection procedure of port States .
At the same time , the flexibility of oil transportations must be safeguarded .
The safety of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution may be promoted by the flag States enforcing the currently valid conventions so as to make them obligatory .
One of the points of emphasis of the EU 's White Paper on transport is the favouring of water traffic in transportation .
For this reason , decisions made only within the Union are not sufficient ; instead , questions of responsibility for marine safety must be dealt with on a worldwide basis .
Mr President , I really regret that the representatives of the presidency are not present as we discuss this very important issue .
But it is evident that other measures have to be implemented as well .
The importance of occupational pensions schemes will rise in many Member States .
The variety of occupational pension schemes and providers would be improved .
They are still disadvantaged when it comes to their occupational pension schemes .
I welcome the Commission communication as a first step towards a solution of this issue .
The pension scheme as well would be exempt and only the output would be taxed .
This system serves to defer taxation to the moment the pension becomes payable , thus avoiding double taxation without the need to harmonise the level of taxation and without thus interfering in the Member States ' taxation practice .
Like our rapporteur , Mrs van den Burg , who has done an excellent job with this report , I also wholeheartedly support the method of open coordination .
Although we in the European Parliament may for the time being unfortunately not have the legislative means to decide on these issues , I can assure you that we follow them very closely and will do our best to achieve a common market for occupational pension schemes .
The two female winners face the same barrier : they are still without their freedom - Leyla Zana is in a Turkish prison and Aung San Suu Kyi is under house arrest in Burma .
Now , on hindsight , we opponents of apartheid are also being exposed as supporters of terrorism .
We are in danger of forgetting that without conflict and social controversy , however heated and powerful , there can be no democracy .
You always immediately took a stance in situations in which people ' s lives were under threat .
You showed no hesitation in promptly adopting a position on the matter .
The European Parliament , which has always been keen to act as the European Union ' s moral conscience , has actually managed to acquire a human face during your term of office , and that face has been yours , for which I thank you .
You have also bravely reflected the majority view in this Parliament in situations in which that has not been very easy .
That cannot have been easy for you either .
You are just the sort of person I would have liked to see leading
