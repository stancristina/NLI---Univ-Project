The EU drugs strategy 2000-2004 provides a framework for a balanced and integrated approach on all drug-related activities in the European Union .
This mid-term evaluation was a first step in a larger process .
Cannabis remains the most widely-used illicit drug and its use is still increasing in many Member States .
When we have detected the transit routes , we try to cooperate with such countries in order to prevent the entry into the European Union of those drugs .
Thank you for raising that question .
I would just add that my concern today is , above all , the proliferation in the use of synthetic drugs and the upsurge of a new profile of drug addict : the poly-consumption consumer .
At the same time , health care systems must achieve the three-pronged aim of health care access for all , higher levels of quality provided by these services and the financial viability of systems .
The conclusions of the task force chaired by Wim Kok suggest various measures that may be adopted to maintain economic growth and to promote active ageing .
It is therefore time to take stock , to assess the mandate – this first five-year period .
I ask for the forgiveness of the chairman of our Parliamentary committee , Mr Hernández Mollar , who will probably refer to this again and who had the idea and proposed it in our debate the day before yesterday .
I would say the first requirement is for a positive assessment of many of the developments already achieved in this five-year period .
Hence , first of all , the future strategic importance that I attach to a more intense policy of providing information in this field .
This is a message that can be drawn clearly from these last five years and in the debates that have taken place : unless , in the remaining areas covered by the intergovernmental method , open and effective cooperation between governments and all the national authorities involved does not progress at the pace that circumstances require , public opinion will exert direct pressure for these competences and fields to be brought gradually within the Community sphere of competence , in some cases for reasons of security , in others for reasons relating to individual freedoms .
We must also invite representatives of the national parliaments , of their corresponding committees , to come and participate in our work and discussions .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , this annual debate is not exactly the same as all the others , because it is taking place at a historically important juncture .
In shall attempt to respect the order in which the honourable Member raised his concerns : in the field of immigration and asylum , the Commission has always sought to weave together the four main strands of this policy , as defined in the Treaty of Amsterdam : regulating the flows of legal immigration , promoting the integration of third-country nationals into European societies , effectively combating illegal immigration and defining a common asylum policy and extending partnership with third countries in order to regulate migration flows .
In the field of integration , the steps that have been taken following on from Thessaloniki are to be welcomed and we are now implementing preparatory projects for a broader strategy for a specific European programme to integrate immigrants into European societies .
With regard to repatriation policy , the Commission is basically proposing , in the short term , actions on two fronts : one involving financial support , which still has to be discussed , and another on an initiative for minimum standards for repatriation procedures .
The Commission will also present a report in Spring 2004 on the negotiations underway on readmission agreements and we particularly welcome the fact that we have been able to reach agreement with the Council and with Parliament on a financial programme for the period 2004-2008 , worth EUR 250 million , to develop a partnership with third countries for the joint management of migration flows .
Last but not least , the issue of judicial cooperation in criminal matters .
It is true , Mr Ribeiro e Castro , that police cooperation involves cooperation more at the operational level than at legislative level , where I believe the Convention on the future of Europe has been proven right to emphasise that the ‘convention ’ instruments in this area do not work : the amendments to the Europol Convention are still awaiting ratification by most Member States ; the Convention on mutual judicial assistance , signed in May 2000 , has still not been ratified by all EU Member States and , consequently , has not entered into force .
It therefore makes perfect sense that we should take stock of the mandate and I congratulate Mr Ribeiro e Castro on the superb report he has presented to us , with which we broadly agree .
Lastly , Mr President , we must deplore the initiative adopted by some Member States to send a letter to the Commission to persuade it to impose a substantial reduction of the Community budget in the financial perspectives for the period 2007-2013 .
We must praise the attitude of the Commission and the commitment of Commissioner Vitorino , which were demonstrated in the proposal for a regulation establishing a programme of technical and financial assistance to third countries in the field of migration and asylum , an instrument that will enable us to address the needs felt by these countries in their efforts to ensure that migration flows are better managed .
I endorse and support this clear priority , but it would also be valuable if the presidency and the Council could give a clear signal to the next presidency , namely the Luxembourg Presidency , that Tampere II is in a position to go
