.
But not so in the EU.
Here , the Commission seeks to silence criticism by all possible means , which is exactly what happened with the sacked accounts director Mrs Marta Andreasen , and when Parliament wished to make thorough enquiries into her criticism , a majority in the Conference of Presidents prevented us from holding a hearing .
However , the Commission knows , and the European Court of Auditors has confirmed , that the criticism is justified , and therefore it must not come to light .
I think that it is incredibly unwise to continue with this hush-hush policy , and I do not believe that it is possible in the long run to avoid the scandal that is the EU 's failure to manage the money the taxpayers are handing over to us .
The problem is that we do not dare to back our criticism up with action .
Mr President , many things have been said about the Commission 's accounting system in the last six months .
The European Court of Auditors confirms in no uncertain terms that many of the recurrent problems surrounding the underlying transactions , which are making it impossible to issue a statement of assurance without reservation , are due to the flawed accounting system .
The Commission acknowledges most of the defects that the Court of Auditors points out .
I am now looking forward to a frank and serious discussion between the Commission and Parliament , so that we can finally get this cleared up .
If something is wrong , it must be put right .
I wish to hold the Commission to this promise , and I welcome the action plan .
The agenda will focus on two subjects : enlargement and the functioning of the Council in the light of enlargement .
Let me start with the latter .
The meeting with the President of Parliament is of course an established tradition at meetings of the European Council ; a tradition that the Heads of State and Government view as important and valuable .
It is important that the institutions have a regular opportunity to exchange views and discuss key European questions , as we are also doing here today ; and as the Danish Prime Minister and I did last week , when we were visited by Mr Prodi , President of the Commission , and Mr Cox , President of Parliament .
If enlargement succeeds in Copenhagen , and it will , this will be another product of the hard work put in by the institutions and their effective cooperation over the last few years .
For some months the pace of the accession negotiations has been very fast .
This has been incredibly difficult and complicated , and it has not yet been resolved .
As you know , the Brussels European Council concluded that ten countries will be ready for membership from the beginning of 2004 .
Last week , the Presidency presented a negotiating package for each of the candidate countries .
They take into account - as far as possible - the views of the candidate countries , as presented at separate meetings with each individual country , and they are in line with the financial framework for enlargement , that is to say , with the Berlin Agreement and with the decisions from the European Council meeting in Brussels in October .
The Presidency hopes that we can cover a lot of ground - as much as possible - in the negotiations before the European Council meeting in Copenhagen .
It is no secret that the final negotiations will not be easy .
Enlargement does not end in Copenhagen , however .
A decision will be taken on detailed roadmaps and timetables , and pre-accession aid , in order to move forward the accession process with Bulgaria and Romania .
At the last European Council meeting , in October , the EU welcomed the new reform work in Turkey .
Turkey 's accession will follow the same principles and criteria as those applied to the other candidate countries .
This decision will be taken at the Copenhagen European Council .
The EU supports wholeheartedly the UN Secretary-General 's endeavours to find a solution .
If a solution is not found to the political conflict in Cyprus at the Copenhagen Summit , the EU will take its decision on the accession of Cyprus on the basis of the conclusions from the Helsinki European Council in 1999 .
Setting the accession date for the new Member States entails a number of institutional consequences , and it is obviously important that Parliament is fully involved in the discussions on these consequences .
I have already had the occasion to discuss matters : during the last session in Strasbourg , where this and other questions were raised by Mr Bar√≥n Crespo ; and also last week in the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy , where we discussed the subject at length .
At the same time , I must also draw attention to the complicated negotiating process under way at this time with regard to enlargement .
It can be said , therefore , that it is an ongoing , intensive process in which we do not have all the answers yet .
They are a necessary part of enlargement as a whole .
We need to make a start now on laying down clear provisions for the transitional period .
In this connection , I should like to make the point that the European Parliament will have to give its assent , and that the accession treaty needs to be ratified in both existing and new Member States .
Agreement on the accession date of 1 May 2004 is based on detailed discussions on what is desirable and what is possible in the light of the ratification process in both the present and the future Member States .
