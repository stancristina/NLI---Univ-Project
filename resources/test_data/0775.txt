Member States have not had the courage to go as far as to introduce the sorts of provisions that currently apply in Austria .
On the other hand , it has to be said that the nightmare scenario of Austria giving up its stricter limit values is now not going to happen .
We could say that , at least as far as this is concerned , the worst has not happened .
The amendments comprehensively cover issues required for the landfill directive .
This includes waste produced from mining and its associated refining processes , or by-products of that industry .
Let us exploit what materials we can .
Mrs Jackson has understood this very well , and included it in her proposal .
Finally , I would like to ask the Commission why it still has not made any distinction in its own report between hard , non-biodegradable , non-hazardous stone , and biodegradable materials .
Madam President , our colleague , Mr Cox , has done some excellent work on the Commission 's proposal .
We must not reject it , as it contains more elements which would influence environmental behaviour than Mr Monti 's proposal which we are now discussing .
He suggests that industry must be able to justify this relief for reasons of competitiveness , and everything should then proceed under the eye of the Commission .
If we wish to move in the direction of environmental sustainability , we would do well to consider a slightly bolder approach .
For this reason the Green Group have made a proposal for this annual index figure to read 4 % above inflation .
I therefore appeal to you all to consider this amendment by the Green Group .
It steers producer and consumer behaviour in a way that has a positive impact on the environment .
One is the northern view of this matter .
Furthermore , I should like to point out that distances are very great in the north , and energy is required for purposes of mobility .
My constituency measures a distance of 1 300 kilometres across .
It is being proposed that employers ' contributions be reduced , but in our case those reductions would result from wrong intentions .
She has succeeded in combining the many very diverse elements of this issue , and , on behalf of my group , I wish to say I am happy that we have achieved consensus .
The question of the responsibility of the manufacturer and that of the distributor has also been raised .
That is important because when this procedure is applied more widely it will be as if the burden of responsibility were much further removed , and thus Parliament is absolutely right to have highlighted the issue .
We see that many of the requests made by Parliament have been given due attention , making for a healthy compromise .
Practice will reveal what the future holds , and if there are defects in the system we will have to go back and deal with them .
Mr Barzanti 's report should basically be concerned with the principles of the free development of the information network and its commercial exploitation , in other words , enabling the consumer to use the Internet at the lowest possible cost to him or her .
As far as the future of the information society is concerned the latter objective is the more crucial one .
The report 's basic theme , that digital copyright may be best protected by prohibiting the temporary reproduction of material for transmission , is completely at odds with the widely accepted principles associated with operating the Internet .
One of Mr Barzanti 's main objectives is to improve the conditions under which European copyright holders can get their work published .
This , contrary to the opinion of the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education and the Media in particular , would not improve conditions for European artists to get their work published and sold .
Illegal reproduction threatens the legitimate interests of copyright holders and ultimately the production of content in its entirety as well as the profitability of creative work .
The EU 's copyright directive , and especially the more stringent version proposed by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights , is a threat to this balance .
In its present form the directive would significantly restrict the free circulation of information and the ability of public service institutions to provide citizens with a service .
In addition to compulsory exemption we must be able to create codes of practice to be applied nationally , on the basis of local tradition and culture , for example in collective bargaining agreements .
We certainly do not want to take a step backwards and have a situation where electronic material cannot be seen , browsed or reproduced without a separate licence or charge .
Mr President , Mr Barzanti 's report is an important one , and he has demonstrated some artistry in putting it together !
Three issues are at odds with each other : first , there is the public 's right to information , which means libraries , lifelong learning , and so on .
That cannot be violated ; it is a vital principle .
Thirdly , we must create and maintain a viable context for the electronic market , as it is an area that employs a lot of people in Europe .
For that reason , I believe we should look at the next stage of the directive , after voting .
At present we have a daily report giving information on the previous afternoon 's sitting .
Today 's report focuses on Mr Barzanti 's report , which is most definitely of interest as far as the issue of information is concerned .
How , for example , will
