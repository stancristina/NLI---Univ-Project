between freedom of information and democracy , and I feel that this debate must serve , not least , to make Parliament and the European institutions more aware than they have been hitherto of the link between democracy and suppressed freedom of information , of the way the media is used to suppress democracy .
Take Italy , for example .
I feel that a comment from the Commission on these matters - state aid , competition , the abuse of dominant positions and so forth in the internal markets - would be appropriate too .
Public television networks can provide alternatives to these tendencies , but we all know that , in the world in which we live , in a liberal society , private , commercial television companies play a major role .
However , we are not discussing forcing the European Commission to do what it cannot and does not want to .
No, in my view , it calls for analysis on the part of the European Union followed by the adoption of political , institutional and legal measures - the substance of which will be for the Commission to decide .
The recent events in Italy were not the result of this very complex issue of the media .
Rather , what happened was that the left , which had controlled state television in recent years , went so far as to attempt to influence the last elections and , in its endeavours to hold the sword of Damocles over its political opponent 's head , put off the issue of regulating the media sector indefinitely and made it very difficult for the matter to be resolved .
There is the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , which , it would seem , is not particularly concerned with public health and gives more importance to the internal market rules .
As others have said and I want to reiterate , it would still be an appreciable result if we were to go home with the Commission 's proposal .
To sum up , it is right to oppose advertising in the interests of public health but , for goodness ' sake , let us not start proposing once again to cut aid to Community growers .
I feel that , if we are to do the job properly , two minutes are not enough to go into the complexities of legal issues .
Madam President , Commissioner , in my opinion and in the opinion of the majority of the committee , I would imagine , the two related reports before us this evening have been prepared with undue haste .
The provisions were therefore toned down but the onus of proof not actually inverted .
It is an appeal , a valuable reminder precisely for all the Member States , which are called to harmonise their legislation or , in any case , cooperate in the field of justice , in this very sensitive area - the confiscation of crime-related proceeds , instrumentalities and property - too .
It must also be said , however , that the proper legislative basis is the action plan endorsed by the Amsterdam European Council of June 1997 and drawn on by the Vienna European Council of December 1998 .
The seizure or confiscation of the proceeds of crime is indeed , as has been pointed out by the rapporteur too , a genuinely effective tool for combating organised crime .
( Applause )
Clearly , the right to become part of the club is not automatically granted : membership is won through very hard work , as the negotiators of the candidate countries are aware .
A paragraph has been included in the report which mentions combating fraud and corruption and combating drug trafficking .
However , I feel it must be pointed out and , indeed , I hope the Council and the Commission will comment on this , that this is not the end of the process of enlarging the European Union .
The democracy of this House , the democracy of the Council and the Commission , the democracy of the Union in general , would certainly not satisfy the criteria which we are setting for the candidate countries now .
This is the issue being analysed by the Convention , an issue which I hope will be addressed and resolved with a decision to adopt the United States ' approach , to adopt US-style democracy , not with a return to the European tradition which has done so much harm to our continent .
Rather , we prefer to talk about unification , for the peoples of the Union are being reunited with the peoples of the former Soviet empire , who were isolated from the area of freedom , peace and progress by the Stalinist superstate .
Turkish democracy has made a great deal of progress - with the abolition of the death penalty , for instance - although a great deal certainly still remains to be done .
As regards the extremely sensitive subject of Turkey - which has been emerging at intervals throughout this debate , never far from the surface - we want to emphasise strongly the courage of the chairman , Mr Giscard d'Estaing , who has caused a ripple in the waters of the often over-cautious debate on European politics , stating the plain facts as they are , as we all know them to be , as is clear from all the history books studied by all the students of all European countries , namely that Turkey is not part of Europe historically , geographically or politically and that it does not satisfy the political accession criteria laid down at Copenhagen on human rights , fundamental freedoms or even freedom of religion .
