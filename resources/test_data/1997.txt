formulation of the rules on protecting designations of origin , and more generally on intellectual property , are more likely to have the opposite effect ; their vagueness and wording seem more of a threat than a guarantee .
But having said that , we should evaluate the quality of this backwardness : economic , political and social .
Technological progress is an all-too familiar slogan .
Mr President , before we vote on the Jackson resolution on the Structural Fund programmes , may I draw Parliament ' s attention to the French Council of State decree dated 27 September 1999 which cancels the notification of 500 sites that could be designated as special conservation sites and therefore pose a problem .
Moreover , Mrs Jackson , I tabled numerous amendments calling for the series of paragraphs you had proposed to be deleted .
All this has been condemned by , among others , the UN High Commission for Human Rights and the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights , and these practices conflict with the undertakings the Mexican authorities entered into under this agreement ( Title I , Article 1 ) .
Of course , some people will say this was merely a new formulation of existing rights , but it is clear that this operation will go much further , with the European Parliament already calling for an innovative Charter .
Turning to the actual content of the Charter , it would seem advisable to divide up these rights into three categories .
Their aim is not so much to defend and promote human rights as to make a clean sweep of all the points of reference on which our societies are founded and replace them with an individualist jumble 'with neither lord nor master ' .
While agreeing with some of the concrete concerns expressed in the report about , in particular , women ' s rights , and while approving some amendments which point the way to progress , we do not intend to support the European Union ' s claim that 'respect for , and promotion of , human rights and fundamental freedoms ... constitute fundamental objectives of EU foreign policy ' .
This clause does not change the fundamental nature of these agreements but does enable both parties to reaffirm respect for certain common values and principles as the precondition for any form of cooperation , economic or other .
May I just remind you that Article 16 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that " the family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State " .
Our powers have gradually increased so that this Parliament has now become a forum for discussion of human rights , a recognised forum as our debate today proves .
The Republic cannot recognise specific 'minorities ' or 'communities ' : in its view there are only autonomous and free citizens with equal rights .
Certainly he has rights , including , first and foremost the , right which , paradoxically , he is often refused , the right to life , which must be defended and promoted ; but you appear to have forgotten that the human being needs the objective limits necessary to all life in society to be established .
That Europe affirms the primacy of a principle not found in the Haarder report , the secular principle , which contains and synthesises all the other freedoms : right to respect for private life , freedom of conscience and religion , freedom of expression and association .
It also implies enabling women to reconcile family life with working life , giving all women the chance to make a genuine choice : how many women have been forced by economic constraints only to have two children when they would have liked three ?
It is only at that price that we can reject the unacceptable hypocrisy of chatting peacefully about human rights while closing our eyes to an economic and commercial system which , in the name of the dogma of free trade , encourages child exploitation in many third world countries .
We are also appalled , however , at the attitude of the western powers , in particular the European ones .
In response to this concern - which , according to the experts , is unfounded - France has proposed to the Security Council that the lifting of the embargo be accompanied by further inspections relating to disarmament and by controls on Iraqi imports .
Finally , the report says nothing whatsoever about the deep-rooted economic and social reasons , in particular the rate of unemployment and the worsening poverty among a growing section of the population , that encourage demagogues of the racist and xenophobic extreme right to stir up unrest .
That is another aspect that shows that this Charter , if it really was adopted in the form called for by the European Parliament - but which we will oppose absolutely - would have the effect of a mechanism for reducing the powers of the nations .
I also agree that leading the fight against racism and xenophobia and the promotion of equal opportunities should be an explicit responsibility allocated to one European Commissioner .
It is against that background that this year , as ever , we are once again debating human rights in the world and in the Union , accompanied this time by a debate on countering racism in the European Union and the candidate states .
The Ludford report is not an account of the good or bad situation as regards racism in the European Union ; it is the political programme of an extreme left-wing libertarianism that , in the end , shows little concern for the natural rights of man .
