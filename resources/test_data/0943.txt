We need traceability and labelling there as much as anywhere else .
We agree with the rapporteur ' s intention to stiffen and speed up the compliance provisions in Amendments Nos 42 and 43 .
We also agree that supplementary information should and can be provided for those Member States that need it and for those special regions which have important information to communicate .
My last point is to end where I began .
My country , Mr President , and yours - if I can call Scotland my country too , as I certainly would - have suffered the horrors of BSE.
We know we bore a large part of the responsibility for it .
It was incumbent upon us to make special provisions by way of food safety as a result .
After our years of effort to that end , we can now justifiably say to the Community as a whole that what we want for ourselves we want for everyone else as well .
Mr President , I wish to put firmly on the record tonight that the farmers in Northern Ireland are exceedingly angry at the UK Government for not seeking European funding to help promote beef labelling .
Other states have taken up this money to the tune of some £4m . the Irish Republic to the tune of £100 000 - yet the disgraceful attitude of the London Government is to keep this from the UK farmers .
I want also to say that the place of origin mentioned in any labelling system should be the real place of origin , because any idea of stating where meat is processed as the place of origin is not acceptable .
That is a very fundamental question that must be made perfectly clear in any law that we pass .
Any food labelling policy must be accurate and dependable for both the producers and the consumers .
Whatever may be the policy of this Union in regard to an open market economy , those people who want to buy home-produced meat should be given the right to know it is home-produced .
Farmers deserve to have a guarantee of that , and so should the consumers .
Mr President , I am very disappointed at the delay , though I am delighted now that we are going to have clear compulsory labelling .
I hope this will restore consumer confidence in beef , especially after the BSE crisis .
I would like to see not only the country but also the region of origin on the label .
I represent the West Midlands which has some of the best beef in the world - Herefordshire beef and Shropshire beef .
I should like to see that go on the label .
I would oppose very strongly the idea that "EU" should be on the label and not the country and region of origin .
I am also concerned about some of the words that might go on the label .
One of those words is " slaughtered " . That will not help with consumer confidence and might put some of the consumers off if they actually see where the animal was " slaughtered " . I wish we could find a new word for it .
Generally speaking , I am delighted that at last we are going to have clear labelling and , as I said , I want it to be the country and region of origin .
Mr President , I wish to begin by saying that I welcome the report .
A European Union-wide identification system for cattle is long overdue .
The system is certainly very necessary , if nothing else than to achieve a level playing field within the European Union and to ensure that all countries reach the same standards .
I want to sound a note of caution .
I come from an area in Northern Ireland that has a standard of identification and traceability which is as good as any ever will be .
No system is a hundred per cent perfect , so do not think you can bring that about .
There will always be people out to abuse the system .
That has been the case for centuries - and will continue .
You can only try to develop the best possible system of traceability .
I have a number of concerns .
The first is : who pays ?
The problem to date has been , in my experience in Northern Ireland , that the consumer has borne the brunt of the cost of the extra traceability , and this has been substantial .
It has not been borne by the retailer .
The consumer will perhaps ultimately pay - but he or she may not .
From that point of view it is expensive for those people .
I have one further question of the Commission .
Is it wise to renationalise the beef market ?
Or even to regionalise it within countries .
I seriously question that point .
We have fought for years within the European Union to achieve a single market and now we are renationalising that market .
I challenge the Commission tonight to answer that question .
Is this a wise move ?
Let us not look to the short term , let us look to the long term , because the long term is the challenge - not five years but ten , fifteen years from now .
What is going to be the situation on the beef market ?
As I said , in Northern Ireland we have full traceability and our measures go beyond the regulations .
I have to say to the Commission , and to producers in other Member States , that my producers have to date not seen any financial benefit from that which they have suffered .
The proposal , as Mr Goodwill has said , has two important aims .
First to ensure the traceability of beef , second to
