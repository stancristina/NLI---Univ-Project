solidarity and environmental and consumer protection .     – Mr President , Commissioner , we all welcome the positive outcome of the August 2004 agreement which was , to a great extent , the result of Community initiatives .
The question of access to the agricultural product market and , more importantly , the technical aspects of the method for calculating ad valorem equivalents proved to be the key point in the negotiations .
Cotton was put forward as a major issue for the promotion of negotiations with less developed countries .
It maintains that the interim agreement constitutes a step along a road which is not ready made : it is the act of walking that creates it .
In truth , if you think about it properly , this is a war , not a war of impressions , but a war of substance at all levels , which is aggravating Europe 's and the United States ' relations with Beijing .
The attention of the European Union and its vigilance in passing resolutions on relations with China are welcome here because : - firstly , 9 categories of Chinese products are currently the subject of investigation ; - secondly , China is becoming stronger and stronger on the world political scene ; - thirdly , the European Union is China 's most important trading partner and China is the European Union 's second most important trading partner .
The WTO is an imperialist organisation which serves the interests of the multinationals and of big business , at the expense of the workers ' interests .
The objective of this initiative is obviously to disorientate and appease the workers intending to vote NO to the European Constitution .
China is already one of the biggest trading powers in the world and its growth has positive repercussions on the development of many other countries .
Similarly , there are serious delays in the application of WTO rules on the protection of intellectual , commercial and industrial property and on foreign investment .
The application of the safeguard clauses for which provision is made in China 's accession agreement is a reasonable last resort , a reasonable .     – Mr President , Commissioner , we need to define measures to protect the textile industry , measures so that the market and trade can operate , and measures to protect consumers .
We need to safeguard these measures by complying with international law and the rules of international trade and , more specifically , through China 's protocol of accession to the WTO .
For the purposes of consumer protection , I think we need to adopt measures to inform consumers about the attributes of products through appropriate labelling , for example with labels of origin , quality labelling , ecological labelling and , most importantly , labelling which indicates the effect of the product on the consumer 's health .
The situation is critical in the Member States , and in Greece in particular , as Mr Mandelson can see from the statistics submitted by the Greek authorities on closures of textile companies and job losses .
However , I should like to say that Mr Mandelson should re-examine the planned duration of the investigation to be conducted by the Commission and of the procedure for unofficial consultations with the Chinese authorities .
The communists and the Soviet Union , who were at the vanguard of the resistance , the sacrifices and the defeat of fascism , are being slandered by the very political powers which nourished , supported or tolerated the rise of fascism .
This rabid anti-communist attack will not stop society from moving towards socialism .
The same fate is in store for the unfair , exploitative capitalist system .     .
The Commission has already issued , on 10 May , a decision allowing areas in set aside to be used for grazing animals in nine independent communities in Spain .
The Commission has issued a communication , in which it outlines the various alternative possibilities for combating the dangers and crises in farming .
The Commission is firmly against this sort of transfer , in order to avoid distortions of the market which put local and regional producers and wholesalers at a disadvantage .
Within this framework , it could examine the possibility of redistributing amounts already budgeted on the basis of rural development , by channelling them to actions to reinforce measures such as 'replacing farmers ' for which provision is made on the basis of Council Regulation (EC ) No 1257/1999 .
However , it should be mentioned that additional support based on the above measures can only be set in motion subject to compliance with the budget for existing programmes .
This means that the damage threshold for 2005 applicable in Spain 's case is just over EUR 3.1 billion at today 's prices .
The Commission has repeatedly proven that it uses all the possibilities offered by the Solidarity Fund for the benefit of states hit by disasters , including mobilising the Solidarity Fund for the shipwreck of the .
However , the effort being made to achieve a degree of flexibility does not mean that certain provisions of the regulation will be overlooked .
The Commission will be delighted if its proposal is supported by Parliament , given that it moves to a considerable extent in the direction being sought today .
The Spanish authorities can also use the new 'de minimis ' rule for state aid .
I should like to say to Mr López , as regards the question of insurance , which is extremely important that , as I mentioned in my initial statement , we have set in motion and have in fact already started this study .
Mr Schlyter 's comments on the adjustments needed in various countries in order to combat climate change are absolutely correct
