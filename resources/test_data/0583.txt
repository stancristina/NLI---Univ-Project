And we were right !
As for expenditure , action must involve an assessment of the context , requirements , the composition of the population , with due consideration for gender policies and demographic change .
When we intervene to support businesses , we must assess the impact on competition , the level playing field and the functioning of the internal market , guaranteeing supervision , accountability , restrictions and consequent behaviour .
The work in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs went ahead in a spirit of excellent cooperation due to the positive attitude of the rapporteur , whom I cannot thank enough , and the Council , perhaps because we realised that we were touching on an area that is closely connected to the financial crisis and that we urgently needed to come up with some timely and appropriate answers .
To conclude , I feel there should be broad agreement on the need to complete this dossier at first reading .
We mark this 10th anniversary by warmly welcoming the entrance of Slovakia , the 16th country to join the euro area .
I concur with the rapporteur in considering that Parliament must declare itself in favour of the conclusion of the agreement because this would clearly streamline the trade in goods and services between the parties in the airworthiness and maintenance sector , avoiding the redundant duplication of assessments and checks on compliance with safety requirements , which until now have had to be repeated even if they are very similar to one another .
I share the concerns expressed by my fellow Member and draw attention to the need , which is more pressing than ever , for appropriate measures to be taken to guarantee all citizens access to healthy , nutritious food , whether they are resident within the European Union or elsewhere in the world .
Lastly , I am delighted by my fellow Member 's initiative , the aim of which is the legal regulation of a topic that is of paramount importance to the Community .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I voted in favour of Mr Guerreiro 's report on the CFP ( common fisheries policy ) and the ecosystem approach to fisheries management .
The aim of the directive is to reduce the impact of pesticides on human health and the environment : a quantitative reduction in pesticide use should therefore be one of the practical aims , to be achieved by specifically setting targets and implementing national action plans .
As the rapporteur for the EU strategy on the rights of the child , it falls to me to stress certain important points in Mr Coelho 's report , even though other fellow Members have already done so .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this is a report on the status of public access to European Union documents and also an opportunity to make some suggestions .
I therefore hope that no one will vote against this paragraph 3 , or paragraph 9 , which asks for information about what is happening within Coreper , the Committee of Permanent Representatives , and asks that they should disclose the meeting documents and not secrete all the international policy papers away as diplomatic documents .
In this paragraph we ask for documents to be created using open-source word processors , technologically speaking , as well as effective multilingualism and technologies that allow persons with disabilities to gain access to information and documents .
This is also addressed to Mrs Doyle , and to Mr Herrero , who has left .
This is an example to show that we ourselves must make the information available to allow maximum transparency , in order to prevent the manipulation and abuse of this information .
As already mentioned , the Convention promotes dignified living and working conditions for fishermen , health and safety in the workplace , adequate rest periods , crew list , repatriation , recruitment , pay , and social security .
I voted in favour of the report .
Now , more than ever , we are realising the importance of the role that can be played by a body such as the Human Rights Council ( HRC ) .
To that end , I believe that voting citizens should also be given the possibility of checking on the activity , participation and attendance by MEPs in Parliament 's work , in absolute , relative and percentage terms , and that steps also should be taken to facilitate access to data on Members ' allowances and spending .
In this case it is the Palestinians that are suffering more , having said that , Mr President , I believe that it would also be right to review the position on aid that has been given and which is being given now , but over the use of which we have no control . on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Rahed is 50 years old ; he has lost his home , his three children , his wife and two sisters-in-law .
Bring in a cease-fire !
This is extremely important .
Then that will be truly serious pressure for Hamas to stop existing and stop carrying out actions that harm the Israeli population .
Israel , however , should know that it is the West Bank which is militarily occupied and it should truly make peace , and not build settlements .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I declare my vote in favour of the report by Mrs Riera Madurell on equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment , vocational training and promotion , and working conditions .
The 'inclusive ' Europe of the post-war period , open to accessions and a point of reference for neighbouring states , has been a factor for peace , even
