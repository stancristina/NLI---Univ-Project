The Council meeting also removed a ban on involvement in national elections .
The proposal has totalitarian features .
The proposal before us contravenes the principle of equality .
In my opinion , the legislation is unlawful and should therefore be tested by the Court of Justice .
For example , it is impossible for national minorities to obtain subsidies , even if they carry on appropriately cross-border activities .
There is a lack of equality across the board , and there needs to be such equality , in accordance with my own constitution , the existing treaties and the draft constitution that is now on the way .
I am , however , opposed on principle to the use of taxpayers ' money for political parties .
I believe they should be supported by the latter .
The need that has arisen in this case has been created by professional politicians , and that is , as I see it , an artificial need .
For the individual taxpayer , it exists solely on paper and is a mere mirage , devoid of substance .
In financial terms , there are no large amounts involved - as yet .
This is the thin end of the wedge , however .
I also think a question mark can be placed over the democratic element in this proposal .
I am in favour of clear transparent rules , but I am not in favour of aid for European parties , and that is why I also reject this proposal .
Mr President , the large groups in this House must be feeling like the cat that got the cream , for there will now be millions pouring into their party coffers , and they will be able to afford fun and games throughout Europe .
It is annoying , but there is no altering matters .
It needs to be possible for any citizen to check all donations to the parties on the Internet and , in the same way , the European parties ' accounts must be accessible to anyone curious about them .
For example , the accounts of the three big political parties are closed and opaque affairs .
This is something we need , of course , to sort out , and I should therefore like to call for detailed monitoring of , and clear rules governing , what the money is used for .
Allow me therefore to call upon everyone to take a look at the parties ' accounts in order to see whether they can in actual fact deduce anything from them .
All they will be able to do is hope that party members will have had some really good junkets and beanfeasts around Europe at the taxpayers ' expense .
Mr President , it is a little odd , for it sometimes sounds as if it is a question of being either for or against European parties .
It is not up to the Commission or the Council or the European Parliament whether or not we are to have European parties .
It is , moreover , up to the people of Europe whether we are to have European parties .
I think that the view being taken , namely the belief that a European democracy or a European public can be brought about through European parties , is quite wrong in a democratic perspective .
The presence of European democracy and a European public gives rise to European parties .
It is the 'bottom-up' , rather than the 'top-down' , mentality we should be adopting in this case .
This proposal is unfortunately an expression of the 'top-down ' mentality , and I shall not support it .
We are in favour of the motion , but are abstaining from voting since we believe that it should be up to the Member States themselves to decide .
Mr President , I shall concentrate on the proposal to award contracts for the supply of water .
In Denmark , the water supply is owned by the consumer and managed locally , and those are very important prerequisites for being able to guarantee that water sources and the environment continue to be protected .
It must not be part of a strategy for the internal market or a means of promoting European industry .
The multinational companies are exceptionally aware of this , and there is money to be made in this area .
A number of directives , including the two we are debating today , have now incorporated water as a commodity and are in the process of standardising countries ' water supplies with the purpose of liberalising them and guaranteeing that drinking water is subject to free competition throughout the internal market .
Experience in the UK and elsewhere is frightening .
It demonstrates that , when the water supply is turned into a commodity and privatised , interest in the protection of resources also disappears .
The world 's total accessible fresh water resources are scarce .
Liberalising the water supply would mean that the fight for water would overtake that for oil .
At the moment , the EU is impeding Denmark 's efforts to safeguard our groundwater against pollution , while the EU is in the process of lifting a number of the bans on pesticides imposed in Denmark .
It must be up to the individual country democratically to decide which model they wish to adopt for the supply of their water .
This is something I of course very much welcome , but it illustrates the fact that there is something fundamentally wrong with the EU 's demand for tenders to be invited in connection with every task .
Mr President , I wish to concentrate on that part of the report concerning public procurement where , unfortunately , the untoward situation has arisen in which , even though we issued a sound report at first reading , the quality
