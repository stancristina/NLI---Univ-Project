.
For example , our immigration policy does contain a security component .
We have tried to define a balanced policy but the contradictory criticisms that have been made in this House show that we may well not have achieved this yet .
It is also clear that the Community per se does not have Community competence in criminal issues .
This is the only way it will be possible to distinguish clearly between humanitarian assistance under international commitments , specifically respect for the Geneva Convention , and the trafficking of human beings which is punishable by law .
I hope that the conclusions of the informal Stockholm Council meeting last week will enable us , at the Laeken European Council , to take stock of this debate on a common immigration policy and on a European asylum system which respect our international obligations and which guarantee the stability and security of the Union ' s Member States .
It makes no sense to extend the already scarce measures in place by another year and to say nothing else about the future of this sector , still less so in that the sector is undergoing a particular crisis due to the extremely strong competition from third countries .
There are various causes of illegal immigration , but I believe that the main causes are , on the one hand , the desire to escape from the difficult situations many countries are now experiencing and to find a better standard of living , and , on the other , the construction of a Fortress Europe , which is making access to Member States ' territory increasingly difficult for citizens of third countries .
As a matter of fact , I voted the same way previously , by approving a proposal included in the Jov√© report on the COM in fruits and vegetables .
This applies particularly to all processes of restructuring , mergers and relocations by companies and to the need to make Community and national aid dependent on long term commitments for employment and local and national development .
I voted in favour of the report by Mr Soares on the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament ' The European Union and Macau after 2000' because it fully addresses the issue of what the European Union ' s concerns and initiatives for Macau should be .
Portugal governed Macau for four hundred years .
The purpose of my speech is , in particular , to draw attention to the particular responsibilities of Angola , a country governed by a totally corrupt military power that has taken advantage of the weaknesses of western capitalism to oppress its people and to threaten the peace , stability and security of the entire region .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , as has already been stated in this House , the harsh winter in Portugal this year has been characterised by terrible floods which have caused loss of human life and enormous suffering , high levels of material damage costing billions of escudos , the destruction or damage of homes , transport infrastructure , telecommunications networks and energy grids and considerable damage to economic sectors , particularly agriculture and trade .
I should also like to express my solidarity with the victims .
Once again , an appeal to European solidarity is being made in this Parliament and it is the Commission ' s duty to find ways of putting this into practice .
Today , the evidence is clear for all to see and we have to act effectively to prevent the situation throughout the world from deteriorating .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Members of the Commission , as my fellow Portuguese Members have said , the abundant rainfall , the storms and the floods have caused enormous material damage , injuries and deaths in the Douro , Mondego and Tagus basins .
Strengthening the sense of belonging to the European Union and the awareness of European citizenship also requires these small , symbolic gestures and brings Europe closer to the people .
Commissioner , I would like you to answer the following questions : how do you think the Irish economy can be cooled down when the rate of inflation in Ireland is higher than the interest rate set by the European Central Bank and , therefore , money in Ireland is very cheap ?
Nevertheless , it has already shown such high levels of growth that it has reached the Community average .
In any event , we will see .
Let us not confuse the current emergency with the essential review of production methods to be promoted through the reform of the common agricultural policy .
Fourthly , what is at stake clearly , in my opinion , calls for this issue to be addressed fully and in depth at the Stockholm Council , and I hope that this will be done .
I feel that the CAP must be reconsidered in order to provide the appropriate responses to what is today known as the ' European agricultural model ' .
Such a move would penalise the poorer countries particularly harshly since farmers in those countries would receive less favourable treatment than their colleagues in other parts of the Community .
Mr President , the aim of my speech , which will be brief , is simply to highlight some of the aspects that I referred to in the opinion of which I was draftsperson on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy .
These facts are not sufficiently appreciated , however , either for what they mean in financial terms , specifically in terms of commitments and the expectations that are raised , or for the responsibility that they require with regard to the political influence exercised on the development processes in the countries involved .
