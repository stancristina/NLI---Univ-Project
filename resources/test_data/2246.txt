Therefore , my first words should be to thank Mr Prodi , who has stayed .
It was a proclamation on the quiet .
Enlargement is going to take place - now we know it .
These are challenges that cannot be overcome , Mr President of the Commission , with our backs to the people .
However , the European Parliament cannot carry on forever reducing its external commitments .
However , sustaining this and Parliament ' s other political priorities needs to be compatible with budgetary stability in spending .
Question No 6 by (H-0886/00 ) : Subject : Measures for the prevention of mad cow disease Has the Council looked into the possibility of a temporary blanket ban on the use of meat and bone meal , with a view to preventing the spread of mad cow disease ?
This indicates that the measures that we adopted at the time were good and have guarantees .
Mr President , our Group supports the work done by Mr Baltas on the report on the feasibility of negotiating stabilisation and association agreements with the Republic of Croatia .
Mr President , during the years when I was President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe , I had the opportunity to support many Croatians in their efforts towards the freedom and prosperity that they , like other peoples on our continent , identified with their integration into the European institutions .
With peace and the consolidation of democracy , the Croatian people have chosen the path of moderation and tolerance , freedom and respect .
It is shameful that we have to debate this and other important matters at night .
It would be good to know what goes on there and perhaps , if the doors were open , the Member States would behave differently .
This also happens in many reports .
Mr President , it seems that we are finally at the end of the road on the proposal for a directive which will regulate takeover bids .
Ladies and gentlemen , we are politicians and therefore , we are always in favour of reaching political agreements .
In the second block are a series of amendments that aim to improve the participation of workers when there is a takeover bid .
In paragraph 1 it is established that it will be that of the Member State in which the company concerned has its headquarters , if - logically - its securities are admitted to trading in that Member State .
Madam President , we are holding a real parliamentary debate because the positions were initially differing .
We have included the special services in the directive itself , and I believe that Parliament has given them the added value that they must have because , otherwise , the Commission ' s proposal could become a back door through which the services of general interest could be attacked .
Commissioner , please allow me to say that you know perfectly well , because the studies that you have at your disposal show that , for example , in Spain 44 % of the postal service is liberalised .
We have to seek equality of opportunity ; we have to seek a legal framework and a liberalising framework , within which we all have fair and balanced opportunities .
Commissioner , it is true that we still have certain reservations and differences .
In certain countries - Nicaragua , Honduras , and Guatemala - Mitch destroyed the banana plantations .
I believe that the amendment tabled at the last minute by Mr Vatanen does nothing to help this issue , and I would ask him , if he is listening , to consider the possibility of withdrawing it .
I therefore ask the Members of this House to endorse this report in its entirety , as did the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
The recent 'mad cow ' crisis , which is going to cost the European Community , its producers and consumers dearly , is an example of how agriculture cannot be reduced to the level of industrial production and marketing .
Thank you very much .
It is no exaggeration to say that this is one of the issues to which all the institutions have paid the closest attention .
I agree with Mr Dary ' s accurate words on this issue .
I would also like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development , Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , for his desire his reach a compromise solution with the Commission .
I am rapporteur for two of them , I am shadow rapporteur for Mrs Torres Marques ' s report and I am tabling amendments to the report on aviation fuel , because I do not agree with some of the ideas which were approved in committee .
The Commission also has other secondary objectives , in accordance with the traditional thinking of ministries of finance : to achieve this objective - that of ending this discrimination - by simplifying the tax , making it considerably more effective in terms of the recovery and reduction of the administrative costs relating to the collection of taxes , to achieve the objectives of efficiency and fairness and to achieve , finally , the modernisation of the tax system .
Some of the arguments which we will hear in the course of this afternoon will say that burdening outside companies which provide services within the Union would put a brake on the growth of e-commerce , but precisely the opposite is true , since maintaining this state of affairs harms the growth of the European e-commerce industry .
And thirdly , services provided by non-European companies to European companies would also be subject to tax , which establishes equality of conditions , in other words , fair play , on an international level .
What does the
