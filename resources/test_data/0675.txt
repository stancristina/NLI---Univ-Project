From our position , given the measures we take , we do not see any reason at all why we would need to introduce , additionally , whole-herd slaughter of the kind done in some other countries .
We are being asked not just for a belt-and-braces policy but also to buy a new pair of trousers just in case .
This would cost a great deal of money .
It would not remove a single additional suspect case of BSE.
I would remind those present that , with our additional safety measures , we in the UK are only exporting to the Community de-boned carcasses which have gone through maximum checks and security .
In the circumstances , therefore , there are a number of amendments tabled by a variety of Members in the United Kingdom which I would commend in this debate .
I should be very glad to hear whether the Commissioner feels he can accept that in some circumstances - particularly in view of the over-30-month cull in the United Kingdom - for those countries which are admittedly very high risk but also with a very high level of precaution now in place a certain number of derogations are necessary and would be satisfactory to him .
I sincerely hope so .
Mr President , Commissioner , I too would like to offer my congratulations to Mrs Roth-Behrendt on her report and to thank her for her openness to discussion on the issues involved .
She will appreciate even better than I how far scientific opinion on TSEs has developed .
For example , the Scientific Steering Committee has recently established that it is necessary to regard the vertebral column and dorsal root ganglion as specified risk material in the UK only for bovines over 30 months and in Portugal only for those over 6 months .
That is why some of us seek an Amendment No 56 to allow adjustments in this area on the advice of the Scientific Steering Committee rather than requiring fresh legislation to implement them .
Similarly , certain measures in combating TSEs have already proved effective .
I refer to the exclusion of animals over 30 months from the food chain , the slaughter and disposal of suspects and offspring of BSE cases , a fully effective feed ban and the removal of a wide range of specified risk materials .
Where such measures are in place , in seems unnecessary to impose the more technical requirement of the date-based export scheme and the certified animal scheme to the domestic market ; hence , Amendment No 53 .
In addition , given that there is no evidence of horizontal transmission of TSEs , there would seem to be no scientific requirement for whole-herd slaughter .
While accepting that some Member States may wish to engage in the practice , I would submit that it should not be compulsory .
Indeed , we take TSE and BSE very seriously in the United Kingdom .
We are committed to the safety of the public and to animal welfare .
We only ask that given that we have taken these measures which we believe to be effective , you do not ask to us to take additional measures which have no scientific justification for them .
Mr President , as an MEP representing a farming area , I have first-hand experience of how devastating the BSE crisis has been to British agriculture .
I can also vouch for the necessity of maintaining effective controls .
You might therefore expect me to be enthusiastic about these new controls on BSE , but I am not .
We already have enough and I believe they are adequate and effective .
This proposal simply adds more red tape and costs to an already overburdened industry .
Of course , I have no objections to other countries adopting measures which match ours .
In fact , it would be helpful if measures already in place in the UK were implemented throughout the EU and elsewhere .
Thus it is not new laws we need - we need more compliance .
Until all Member States are able to assure us that there is full compliance , this proposal , if passed , will simply add to the list of laws which have not been implemented .
In any case , if more controls were needed , we should not be looking to the Commission for guidance .
The British BSE inquiry which was commissioned by the UK Government at a cost of £20 million is due to report in November .
We should wait to see what this inquiry says .
Mr President , legislation which seeks to protect the public from a terrible brain disease such as new variant CJD should be drafted to complement measures already in place in Member States , to recognise the stage of the epidemic that we are at and have due regard to the body of scientific knowledge we have built up .
The United Kingdom already has comprehensive and effective measures in place to protect human health and eradicate BSE in our herd .
This is working .
Cases of BSE are declining rapidly .
But most importantly , so far , we have not had a case in an animal born since the complete feed ban was introduced .
That should be happening around about now , if it was going to .
No older animals over 30 months of age enter the food chain .
It is likely that cases may occur due to maternal transmission but these will be isolated and not feed-related , and there is no justification for a return to cohort culling .
Incidentally - and Mrs Grossetête referred to this - there has been recent press speculation about a third possible infection route through grass contaminated by faecal material .
This only applies - as I understand - to animals excreting pathogens
