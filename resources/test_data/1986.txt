, and yet we all put our signatures to them ; we made promises .
If we were to engage in fair trade , a great deal of the assistance would probably be rendered unnecessary .
That is the heart of the matter .
However , we must realise that nothing is as hard as changing people 's behaviour , particularly when we are talking about 500 million of them .
Finally , we must be sure to strike a balance with regard to the amount of information we provide to people , as too much or too little will never work .
Nutrition experts and consumer organisations recommend a simple colour coding system to make food labels understandable and to make it easy for people to make their own choices .
It is high time there was greater transparency and that profit made and tax paid were automatically disclosed .
Nevertheless , I should like to share a few reflections .
Firstly , the approach to the Baltic Sea can also be an example for other macro-regions , for example the Danube .
We already have various legislative instruments at our disposal - in the treaty and in certain directives - to enable us to take action .
We should definitely take action on this .
Today , in the vote on the Bauer report , I voted against the Commission proposal regarding the directive on the organisation of the working time of persons performing mobile road transport activities .
The rules on working time in road transport now before us do not regulate the legal status of 'false ' self-employed drivers sufficiently and do not represent a solution to possible abuses .
People must be protected against overtime working , which jeopardises not only the driver 's own safety but also that of others .
Reliable , comprehensible information on the packaging plays a major role .
These new rules offer consumers the opportunity for a healthier diet if they so desire .
Milk with a shelf life in excess of seven days is no longer to be labelled as fresh milk .
This national approach is pure protectionism and thus harmful to European and Dutch exporting companies , in particular .
After all , its military leadership had other conceivable options at its disposal that would probably have resulted in far less violence and far fewer casualties .
You also know that , in a deeply insulting way , this same Turkish Government then called the Israelis to account after the tragedy .
In the field of visa liberalisation , concerted efforts towards reform have indeed proved possible , and visa-free travel to Europe is now within reach for Bosnians .
Bosnia and Herzegovina must punish the perpetrators and give these women more support .
The country still has some work to do , for example , on the position of vulnerable groups in society , the ethnic conflicts and the right to freedom of expression .
In particular , insufficient progress has been made on market access by European carriers in the United States and on potential European ownership of and control over United States carriers .
Therefore , despite some positive elements also cited by my fellow Member Mr Grosch - in the environmental and social fields , for example - we shall only be able to accept this agreement if we are given more than a commitment to take further steps .
It was adopted in 2001 and should have been transposed by March 2003 , yet seven years later we note that , in fact , 22 countries are not in compliance and have failed to transpose it sufficiently .
Yet with regard to domestic passenger transport , which many wish to see liberalised , I should like to be very cautious .
Europe has a truly major role to play in this .
Concrete and more concrete only increases the risk of even more flooding .
A sustainable certification system is needed for aquaculture products that provides certification in respect of environmental and social effects , food safety , animal welfare and economic and financial aspects , among other things .
What is needed is not new institutions - indeed , fortunately , this would not attract any support within the Council - but instead , a strong , independent role for the Commission .
Mr President , you called on us to take a quick decision on the financial supervision package , yet you know that the problem does not lie with Parliament ; it lies with the Council , which is still not prepared to actually put the de Larosi√®re report into practice and transpose it into legislation .
Over the coming years , we must keep close track of how both the Commission and the Member States implement priority actions .
In that context , I welcome the agreement we have reached and I thank the people in the Council who worked on that , the people in the Commission and members in this House .
The Commission will also consider how we might interconnect the maritime and inland shipping systems so that we can establish a continuous and a fully sustainable chain for water-borne transport .
We had to strike a compromise regarding the date .
The Council only looks at the costs and never wants to talk about what benefits a particular measure might spawn .
As far as exemption from compulsory pilotage is concerned , let us hope that a common framework is set up , because such a framework would make competition between piloting services even fairer , while , at the same time , guaranteeing the quality of pilotage .
So , thank you for pointing that out , Commissioner , but in this directive , we also make a number of demands on you , such as pilotage , where ports have a pivotal role to play as points of intersection .
