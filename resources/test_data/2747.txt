itself , by virtue of Articles 92 and 93 , imposes certain limits within which such assistance must operate .
And fourthly , SMEs are hugely important in all this .
In other words , I am not so interested in the figures - I am sure that those you have quoted will be correct and I believe them - but is it really true that what has applied to Spain and Greece until now might be increased by 300 000 ?
All this is proposed while ignoring the fact that demand in coming years is forecast to be high and that the European Union 's international competitors are continually increasing their production capacity and adopting support measures .
Ultimately , what do competition and the existence of a shipyard industry and jobs mean for us ?
It should also ban the entry of low-specification vessels into its ports as a way to bring about their withdrawal , and tackle the problems of taxation and social dumping in the field .
I would like to stress two points here .
There was no timely , integrated and , above all , disinterested implementation of a far-sighted strategy that would effectively express international solidarity .
Russia 's succession of adventures at that time often sounded alarm bells warning of a return to the dark past , and even of bloodshed .
One cannot be complacent about the tremendous difficulties Russia still faces a decade after the change , a vast country with a heroic people and with a rich historic tradition and spiritual heritage .
What is of primary importance is that this strategy should commence in parallel with the enlargement process already begun .
I therefore think the debates now taking place about transparency , about the "absolute management ' method , or the fears being expressed about whether the European Central Bank will act imperiously or in ways that do not benefit the societies it represents , are rather unnecessary .
Mrs Randzio-Plath 's very good report , as it has developed , proposes precisely a balance between those two factors and , I think , expresses a very correct opinion .
For the single currency 's management , Europe is at last getting a Central Bank equal to the task , a bank that will exercise Europe 's monetary policy in a unified way that takes into account the needs and interests of all the single currency Member States and , I hope , those of the countries which are not yet members of the single currency but aspire to become so soon .
That will not happen in the future .
In the process of democratic accountability advocated by the report we are debating , Parliament will be able to point to the general interest , according to circumstances , and so create a climate which provides a framework for the Central Bank to fulfil its duties in the best possible way .
We view the fact that the process of the Republic of Cyprus 's accession has begun as important , with talks about accession which not only represent a beginning but must promise an end to that process .
That devaluation is already worsening all the Maastricht indicators concerning EMU.
Public debt is increasing by 5 % of GDP.
Can Mr Henderson tell us whether there is a tendency to equalize the green exchange rates with the commercial exchange rates of the currencies ?
The refugees have not gone home , arms may have brought peace but it is fragile , millions of ECU remain unabsorbed , the central administration does not function , the system of democratic liberties and human rights is not working properly .
An extension of the military presence , and not only that , but its reinforcement too , they are recommending that to make its presence felt the European Union must play the tune of calling for mobile military forces , interventions by the WEU under NATO 's leadership , more and more military intervention , and for what ?
Let them bury their hatreds and passions and find for themselves how to cooperate peacefully , so that economic and social reconstruction and development can progress .
Mr President , Mrs Schaffner 's report raises issues which cause financial , political and social problems to those who either live or move within the borders of the European Union .
However , it is forward-looking in that it sees the problems , confronts them and proposes solutions to them .
A third point I would like to mention is that my group will of course be delighted to vote in favour of the report , but we disagree - for very specific and fundamental reasons - with Amendments Nos 8 and 9 and with the second part of Amendment No 11 .
Mr Commissioner , the first challenge is this : you said that after a transition period lasting seven years we did not need a report , and that we would not draw up a report .
However , was it the policy of each Member State individually that caused these repercussions or was it Community policy ?
Do you know why you are delaying the study ?
If not , it would have been very easy for you to produce evidence to show that such and such would be the repercussions , such and such would be the tax gains .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the problem of the use of nuclear energy and the dangers of a nuclear accident resulting from this use has three dimensions as far as the European Union is concerned .
The third concerns those nuclear sites located in distant countries , such as Ukraine , and I refer more specifically to the issue addressed by Mr Adam 's excellent report - Chernobyl .
However , in my opinion two problems remain unsolved
