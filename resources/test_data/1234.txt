to devote a number of years to having children and bringing them up .
They voted to ensure that Member States are from now on forced to regulate the right to a voluntary job , anywhere and at any time .
You therefore held three roll-call votes instead of two , which is very expensive for us since one roll-call vote costs FF 8 000 .
For a monitoring policy to function , it must win and maintain the support of fishermen .
This is why I do not understand why our amendments have been rejected , when they are acting in the financial and moral interests of children in calling for a policy to prevent single parent families as much as possible , by educating people to be responsible .
I also think it is a very positive step that a section for the development of small-scale fishing has appeared for the first time in a fishing agreement .
It is for this reason , over and above the fact that Mr Wibe 's legal analysis is excellent , that the Liberals are in favour of waiving Mr Le Pen 's immunity - and they are not alone in this - given that such a step is not a prejudgment but will allow the case to be heard , and heard in the right place .
And the word 'detail' , in French at least , carries no such connotation .
This mendacious procedure is a scandal .
The National Front 's claim that Mr Le Pen is a victim of political opprobrium , of political manipulation on the part of French justice in an attempt to wreck his electoral chances , does not hold water .
According to these precedents , immunity has to be upheld where there is fumus persecutionis , a whiff of persecution .
' Ask Winston Churchill ' , I replied .
The second attempt has smoothed off the rough edges and simply gone along with the US conventions .
As Mrs Pailler said , there are references to a 'drug-free society ' , which is absurd .
So what exactly is the position ?
All we want is a calm debate based on impartial considerations , without arbitrary edicts and without anathema .
Efforts to introduce measures which are unrealistic , uncheckable and which carry penalties can only undermine the credibility of the inspection system .
This is actually already happening , and it is also clear to everyone that this will have serious economic and social consequences .
Everyone is agreed on this .
It has approved only five , rejected 32 , and the other 13 were inadmissible or incomplete .
I consider that immorality rules in this Parliament , since the freedom of speech , which is an essential human right , is not being respected .
This is an example of witch hunting .
If Jean-Marie Le Pen had said these words in the building of the European Parliament delegation in Germany , then depending on which side of the door he was standing , he would or would not have enjoyed immunity .
( The President cut the speaker off )
That is precisely what I wish to see .
The absence of any critical capacity is a prerequisite for the extravagant financial demands which they arrogantly claim should follow on from the reparations which Germany has stopped paying .
It is true that , today , in order to forget an extremely troubling past , we are prepared to do anything .
In order to combat a risk which , in my opinion , is non-existent - namely the risk of a revisionist contagion on the question of the gas chambers - we should not risk committing an abuse which is much more palpable , much more immediate and much more menacing in many ways - the abuse of muzzling the freedom of expression by an official line of thought .
In strictly legal terms , this request poses serious questions .
It is pointless to insist on a web of complicity between the extreme right and a large part of the right which today is assuming a position of condemnation .
This is also the only homage which politics can now pay to the victims of this barbarism .
All these unresolved questions simply underline the great lie of the single currency .
There has been an attempt to ignore the real differences between countries so as to improve the success of the monetary unification project , which is the springboard to federalism .
This quite farcical situation at least has the merit of showing that the ECB is primarily concerned with the repressive side of its action .
' We are preparing for their future integration into the euro zone ' say ECB officials .
Next June , during the UN General Assembly special session on drugs , we must be united .
The search for artificial havens demonstrates their need for absolutes ; however , neither work , nor science , art , sport , ecology or politics , whether at national or European level , are such absolutes .
To conclude , Mr Bontempi 's report contains sound principles and advocates realistic cooperation .
Certainly , for the European institutions , the euro may lead to a reduction of the costs of budget management , since 56 % of Community payments which are currently converted into national currency will remain in the euro , hence the disappearance of the exchange-rate risk .
As with federal Europe itself , the single European currency is perhaps the light of a star which has already faded , given that globalisation and internationalisation have happened so quickly - more quickly anyway than the construction of a federal Europe .
However , the fight against fraud cannot be discussed without noting that total freedom in the circulation of goods and capital - that is , the absence of any controls - favours fraud and trafficking on a large scale
