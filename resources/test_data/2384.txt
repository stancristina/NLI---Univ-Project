be institutional coordination of economic and social policies in the euro zone , coordination capable of taking majority decisions and showing , not least in the work of the Convention , that the enlargement of the Union which we are determined to make every effort to achieve will not hinder the progress or dampen the vitality of the European Union in the search for new , more advanced forms of integration .
I feel that the European economic structures need to be completely overhauled .
We owe this to the future generations of European citizens .
I hope , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , that Europe may once again speak with one and the same voice on this basis .
Unilateral war will split the UN ; it will split the Atlantic Alliance ; and it will throw Europe into crisis .
If there is war , it will be a disaster .
The document adopted on 17 February must be the starting point for action by the Council and the Commission , and it is the primary duty of all the political groups represented in Parliament to act to prevent the credibility of the United Nations being eroded away .
Mr President , the Karas report regulates supplementary pension funds with a directive .
If one talks about increasing employment in Europe , one should also be talking about reforming pensions for those in work .
Mr President , we are talking about the finances of the countries that have adopted the euro .
The murder of Zoran Djindjic has , amongst other things , implications for the tabling of certain amendments to the resolution we are about to put to the vote .
I think the two-month period requested for the European Community for initial monitoring of the results of the mission is too short .
The airlines and national authorities that safeguard personal data are placed in a situation of legal uncertainty , exposed to prosecution for breaking national laws and to the risk of serious financial damage .
The same is true of Paragraph 4 of the Commission recommendation to the national data protection authorities , according to which it is not necessary to take enforcement measures against airlines that are not complying with the United States ' requests .
The Commission has also said that this would have prevented long queues for passengers arriving at the various destinations in the United States .
In order to clarify this and other points , the European Parliament has now convened a public hearing and , perhaps , after this hearing we shall first of all know a little more about how it was possible for all this to have come about and , secondly , have a rather clearer idea especially about what it would be best to do now , while avoiding emotional schizophrenia and agreeing on joint , coherent standards to be enforced in future .
I think it is fundamental that there should be a high-level policy group to restore the gender balance in Parliament 's governing bodies and in Parliament as a whole , especially in view of enlargement , which must take into account the goals we wish to achieve .
Mr President , I too should like to thank Mrs Avil√©s Perea for her excellent report and , to tell the truth , there is not much to add to what she has written and what has been said this evening .
In truth , it is quite unacceptable to the Committee on Legal Affairs because the legal order of the European Union provides neither competences in matters of criminal procedural law nor a judiciary at all levels of jurisdiction that could ensure a full right to defence .
Again , the different approaches to issues which are ultimately similar such as - by way of another example - the issue of labelling , in which the presence of identical substances is being regulated differently only a few months later , fall short of the ideal .
Here , once again , the Commission has a decisive role , although it is true that , from a general perspective , only five States have thus far met the targets set by the Barcelona European Council on implementation rates .
The spread of the habit , particularly among young people , is mirrored by the increasing , truly appalling figures representing the geometric increase in cases of lung cancer , which calls for much greater determination from Europe to implement the measures already planned .
The programme also provides for a plan of priority actions through which consumers can decide with the Member States on monitoring and , where necessary , appeal procedures , thanks to a system of genuine administrative cooperation .
Consumers and their various networks must have the capacity and the necessary resources to promote their actions on an unrestricted level playing-field within the internal market , and to do so in all areas , in respect of companies and the various production organisations .
It has been noted that , although no longer under house arrest , Aung San Suu Kyi is being subjected to pressure , threats and intimidation .
Consider , for example , the tragic child-soldier system .
Even the recent endeavours of the Thai Government have been frustrated by the categorical opposition of the Burmese authorities , which have even refused to give members of the political opposition permission to leave the country in order to discuss its economic problems .
I come from a country where the crime of honour continued to exist even after the war , a country which only recognised rape as a crime against the individual in the seventies , when the feminist movement was in its heyday .
Nigeria has even adopted a Constitution which guarantees the right to freedom without torture or punishment .
This they have clearly failed to do .
