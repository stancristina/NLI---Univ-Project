This means that the EU' s agricultural arrangements are of benefit to all EU citizens .
It demands a great deal in terms of the supply of information and , especially , in terms of the coordination which is needed if cooperation is to succeed , both within the Member States and independently of the Member States .
I would also draw your attention to the fact that , in recent years , conventional farming has been put under pressure .
This is what some people call stability .
I would also recall the fact that the Commission has recently tightened up on the conditions for intervening in the area of grain .
Wheat growers , in particular , will be affected very badly , which they already are because of a 15 % fall in prices , but then there is also a tightening up on quality and with regard to the issue of protein crops .
This means , moreover , that , especially in the northern part of the EU , there will be further price falls in the offing .
We shall then be able to withdraw our proposal under item I.
Madam President , I should be glad if we could vote on item IV before I decide about that .
Mr President , because of its wealth , Western Europe is naturally a magnet for everyone seeking protection and fleeing persecution .
But encounters between people from different cultures are not always simple , and they should therefore be helped along , just as refugees should be given support to begin new lives in their new locations .
However , all refugees have some basic needs in common , and special groups need professional help and support so that they can again start to live lives appropriate to human beings .
What is more , they need advice and guidance from the authorities in their new countries and in connection with their actual seeking of asylum .
All refugees begin with a dream of returning home .
They acquire children and friends and a new life for themselves .
Therefore , a number of them choose in the end perhaps to apply for citizenship in the new country .
Integration and repatriation are not , therefore , opposed to each other , and integration is not only for people who wish to move country for good .
It may , in fact , prove to be a prerequisite of successful repatriation .
Responsibilities in Europe are unfairly distributed in relation both to the Member States ' size and prosperity .
It is not a question of the ratio between the number of refugees and the number of existing citizens .
It is a question of the actual task which is to be undertaken .
It is not about relative numbers , but actual numbers .
I hope the discussion may make it a little clearer what the thinking here is .
We are talking about EUR 26 million to cover the fixed expenses of the current work , distributed among 15 Member States .
By German or Italian reckoning , the amount must seem tiny .
I am very anxious to know whether the Commission has some good news for us and whether it has given the necessary consideration to the issue in question so that the Fund will have a future and not just become a nonsense over the next few years .
And if it has a good beginning and if we are able to follow up the issue , then it will only be natural for us to increase the amount concerned so that the Fund really can live up to its name as the European Refugee Fund .
Mr President , in Denmark , Pernille Frahm and her party have led the way in the struggle against what they call "more Union " .
They campaigned against Denmark ' s joining the single currency , which we are to vote on in September , and they have been on the "no " side in four out of the five previous Danish referenda .
That is why I am so pleased to read Pernille Frahm ' s report in which she does not merely approve , but also requests , "more Union " in the form of mutual aid in connection with the burden which the influx of refugees imposes upon us .
I agree .
The Refugee Fund makes it possible to help more refugees in the vicinity of their own countries where they can maintain links with their families and native cultures and continue to put pressure upon the tyrants who drove them from their homes .
We saw the need during the war in Kosovo .
They would have much preferred this than to have been sent thousands of kilometres away to distant countries .
If we could make Pernille Frahm rapporteur for European cooperation , too , then I am sure that we could agree about that issue as well .
Mr President , allow me first of all to emphasise that , in the referendum on the Edinburgh Agreement in 1993 , the Danish people declined to participate in EU cooperation on legal issues , and Denmark is not , therefore , bound by any legal obligations to allow the EU to decide which refugees are to be received by Denmark .
And one cannot in all decency receive money from the EU if one will not also allow the EU to decide which refugees are to be allocated to which countries .
I think it is the individual countries ' responsibility to finance their refugee policies themselves and , for that reason alone , I have to vote against this report .
If , as in Denmark , the majority of applicants are given asylum or residence permits , then legitimate refugees are
