fully comply with the objectives which we set ourselves at the beginning of this year in the directives for the 2004 budget , namely to draft an economical budget .
Enlargement was the single most important element in the 2004 Budget , and I am therefore delighted to be able to announce that Parliament has agreed to the majority of applications of new Commission posts .
At the beginning of this year , Parliament declared itself in favour of a budget for 25 Member States .
Cooperation with the Italian Presidency has also been very successful , for which my thanks .
That is , of course , a little bizarre as a reason , though .
This does mean , however , that Afghanistan has less money to spend , or does the Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats intend to release this money at a later date without one single measure being taken against the drugs trade ?
Parliament wants more information about the steps that are taken in the Commission ’s reform process .
That is a good idea and we must request , or even demand , this from the Commission , and , if it does not provide this information , we should have the courage to take political steps against it .
What is positive about the outcome is that we need not worry in our debates about the threat that the Council will touch Parliament’s say in the budget .
I like the amendment tabled by Mr Mulder , Mrs Gill and Mr Garriga Polledo , but surely they are not so naïve as to believe that the Commission ’s reforms can be completed by next spring ?
Export refunds are very susceptible to fraud .
This is why I am disappointed that many in this House are not prepared to set aside substantially more money for the reconstruction of Iraq .
This is why I am pleased that the Committee on Budgets has backed my main amendment , in which it is clearly stipulated that new future commitments can only be funded if these are met by new additional financial resources .
I do think , however , that the issue of Ecofin is a difficult one .
I am not concerned with restricting the rights of this Parliament , but what would be eminently possible would be to restrict Ecofin’s rights somewhat when the European Council meets again .
We greatly appreciate this .
In the accession negotiations , it was agreed with these countries that they would include a protection period of six years in their legislation .
In any case , it is a good thing that all medicinal productsfalling under EU regulations will have to comply with the same criteria of quality , safety and efficacy .
In my opinion , however , there are too many possibilities for an extra year’s protection to be added , for example when a new indication can be proved .
The centralised procedure via the EMEA in London is increasingly becoming the norm for an increasing number of medicinal products .
I am happy that the Commission has spoken out on Doha and stated that it will present legislation in early 2004 .
Homeopathic medicinal products did not make it .
It was not an enormous agreement , but it was a start nevertheless .
Firstly , you have just said that you are prepared to introduce , in the near future , the legislative measures enabling the implementation of the decision of 30 August .
I accept that it is not possible to win on every point .
On this subject , the compromise achieved does all users of these medicinal products a great injustice .
I agree with Mrs Corbey’s comments .
My question to the Commissioner was crystal clear , and I should like a little bit more clarification on this .
With the accession of ten new Member States on1 May and the elections next June casting their shadow , it is now make or break time .
For that reason , we think that the Statute should have been in place long ago .
Years ago , the then Belgian Presidency proposed a compromise enabling us to accommodate subsidiarity on this point .
One knot that we still have to cut concerns pay .
If not , it is over to the Irish Presidency .
The international community must no longer stop at lip service .
China is no small player .
Therefore , all fellow Members are rightly saying ‘no lifting of the arms embargo’ : that gives out the wrong signal .
I actually agree with that equality of pay , although it does lead to extreme differences in income among MEPs in practice and is therefore seen as encouraging fraud .
More must be done to render disasters involving oil tankers at sea and involving nuclear power stations practically impossible , but if such disasters occur nevertheless , the damage is vast .
The result is that the supply and price of medicinal products varies considerably among the Member States .
It does , however , strike me that this report steers clear of a few important political issues that have arisen during the discussion of this topic , and so a more comprehensive discussion would have been desirable .
I should like to revisit the objective of this directive , which is , of course , the interoperability of electronic toll collection systems .
This is the theory , but the heart of the problem , does , of course , lie to some extent with the Council of Ministers .
GSM and GPS technology already exists , and GPS2 is only around the corner .
Indeed , a great deal of energy went into striking a compromise and into changing the transitional system that was put in place upon Austria’s accession , to a more general system .
