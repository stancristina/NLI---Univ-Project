us .
That is why I hope India and Pakistan will come to the negotiating table , together with the people of Kashmir .
I would like to see either the European Union or the USA acting as an honest broker , as a mediator , to try to find an end to this dispute .
But whatever happens , the human rights abuses must stop .
We have daily reports of rapes , murder , torture , and a lot of people say , " Oh , this is an exaggeration " .
But when I was in Azad Kashmir and I went to one of the refugee camps a few years ago I was very moved by the first-hand accounts I heard .
I was even more moved when I went into a tent where the women and children were .
I went up to one woman and although we could not speak each other ' s languages we stood there and hugged each other .
That woman was sobbing her heart out .
I could almost touch the pain , really feel the pain of that woman .
She was not acting it , she was not pretending it - nobody goes to a refugee camp for fun .
They were there because they had been tortured , they had been mistreated and they were escaping .
That was not an isolated incident , and it is still happening today .
We must find a solution .
They must come to the negotiating table .
Mr President , I am as delighted as others are that we are having this debate today for the first time in our elected parliament in this session .
It is long overdue , for the reasons which our previous speakers have already underlined .
Relations between India and Pakistan are indeed deteriorating , with Kashmir being a particular bone of contention .
Tensions are also being aggravated by the fact that these two countries are nuclear powers .
Indeed , in the Herald Tribune of Tuesday , March 14 , 2000 , the headline reads : " Nuclear war between India and Pakistan is a real possibility " .
For this reason alone , supported also by the well-known UN resolutions and the reference which has already been made to the constant violation of human rights , Kashmir is no longer a problem that can be swept under the carpet and not debated in this Parliament , as has happened for many years .
It is increasingly an international problem and one where mediation will , in my view , become essential .
So what can we do to bring long-term stability to this volatile region ?
We discussed this issue when we met with members of the US Congress in our normal framework of delegations earlier this year .
The US is in favour of arbitration , but it strikes me that , when President Clinton visits these two countries next week , India should be asked to come to the negotiating table so that , together with Pakistan , it can find a long-term settlement to this Kashmir question .
Equally , the European Union should , when formulating policy towards South-East Asia , raise the profile of this issue in order that we in the Foreign Affairs Committee can have a more substantive reason to have a debate in our Chamber in a few months ' time .
As these two approaches are made , this two-pronged approach by the European Union and the United States is , in my view , the best way to start the process for long-term peace and stability in this region .
Mr President , I see from my order paper that the vote on the situation in Iraq has been withdrawn .
Can I be told at whose request , and what reasons were given for withdrawing that ?
Mr President , although it would have been better if we had voted at lunchtime , I am happy to go ahead now .
Mr President , on a point of order , I am very pleased that this report has gone through .
We spent a very long time voting on this .
Most of these amendments were put down either by members of the technical group of racists or by the EPP on positions that they lost in committee .
We should not be spending so long voting on amendments put down when they lost their position earlier on .
We could have done it much more quickly because the position has been quite clear .
- As a former Minister in the UK for race relations I am very much aware of the need to look constantly for ways of improving relations between all groups and interests in the population .
This requires a careful mixture , firstly of education , and only when absolutely necessary , of legislation .
This report totally fails to provide a balanced approach .
It is gesture politics at their worst with the clear ideology of the author taking precedence over good sense .
It is damaging through its stridency .
It gives no credit for the great achievements in race relations in EU states .
It offers only a defeatist agenda , not one of a positive nature .
It insults those who are trying to improve a situation and therefore it is offensive to many .
In short , it is an abuse of the opportunities offered by our Parliament to debate and determine issues like this which are vital and important and deserve better than this approach .
Those of us who really care know the great difficulties of this subject .
We simply cannot support such an appalling set of proposals , particularly as Baroness Ludford 's approach could have the unfortunate result of turning the majority against the minority rather than harmonising relations .
This report would undermine rather than improve race relations
