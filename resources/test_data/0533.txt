11 and 12 .
Plus , the weight of piglets various enormously , from 8 to 30 kg , and there is , as it were , no uniform price quotation system for standard piglets , meaning that there is no basis on which to support them .
However , I thank you for the serious debate which we have had here and I hope that we shall be able to reach a result on the basis of the Commission proposal , because the problem here - and I make no bones about it - is that the Member States still have very differing views on this matter .
That is the European Court of Auditors ' message to the Commission .
The Court of Auditors also makes it clear in its report that the errors identified by the Court do not amount to fraud , nor are they detrimental to the budget .
I would like to welcome this trend on behalf of the Commission , as these special reports are very topical and can therefore also be valuable in making up-to-the-minute decisions .
It has also set up an internal audit service which will monitor the control systems in individual departments as well as creating a central financial service which all the Directorates-General can use , for instance when they are drawing up contracts or when they need help in implementing the provisions of the Financial Regulation .
Unfortunately , we cannot yet answer with a clear conscience , even armed with the Court of Auditors ' new annual report .
Closure is a condition for such a discharge .
I believe that we urgently need clearer criteria for next year 's report by the Court of Auditors .
After all , we have to judge what the new Commission achieved in 1999 .
If the directive had already been implemented , the accident in Austria might not have happened .
We believe that in such cases the trade should not be burdened with manufacturer 's duties under product safety legislation .
The possibility of having a product 's compliance with regulations certified by an external agency would certainly be very helpful in this case and would ensure a clearer and more logical approach .
As we are talking about our citizens ' rights , I would like to know if we have ever adopted any amendments on the German language .
One more point about timing : this report contains many examples of ambiguous and infelicitous wording , because we have had to hold our debates and votes under extreme time pressure and the amendments were not available in all languages .
( DE ) I doubt if anyone here will deny that pigmeat producers throughout the EU Member States have , over the last two years , been faced with a crisis which has had devastating consequences for many of them .
Flawed thinking of this kind has no place in the European Union .
That is the alternative to the manipulation and trickery of insurance systems that comes with statutory schemes .
Financing statutory health care and pension schemes is at the heart of the social and budgetary debate in Europe .
No, what we are dealing with here is a permanent situation in which each new technological wave brings with it new winners and losers .
I am also willing to concede that the Commission , no doubt because of enormous pressure from the European Parliament , has made great progress in recent years in gaining acceptance for the principle of precautionary consumer protection .
It is good that in this respect we are adhering to the joint decisions adopted in 1997 , as Mr Byrne explained .
Why did this Council , which attaches so much importance to consumer protection and which now acts as if public health were its top priority , not act earlier and say that this could also be achieved without legislation ?
We have already put large parts of this in place , and we are trying to take this further , and we need to act quickly .
There is no scientific justification for a general ban on using animal meal for all animals .
You played no part in it whatsoever .
We have not let ourselves be lured into calling for a total ban on animal meal , because in that case we would have had to call for a total ban on meat , because if what is deemed fit for us to eat can no longer be fed to animals , that is not just nonsense , it is political populism !
We are pursuing " sinners " who are not guilty at all .
I find it bordering on the cynical , Mr Byrne , when you say that this should not happen on environmental grounds .
The benefits of synergy are felt when Member States ' measures are linked with Community policies , actions and instruments and with the European Structural Funds .
First , however , I would like to make some preliminary comments about promoting renewables .
If we define a clear , binding framework for the Member States , then there should be a longer evaluation period for the various support systems required to satisfy these requirements .
This is necessary because we can only create legal certainty and avoid disputes through clarification .
I believe that it takes great courage to keep renewable energy in the spotlight in the way she has managed to do .
We also need to make sure that requests are made in a realistic framework .
Demand has risen many times over in recent years , and yet this fact has scarcely been taken into account in general working life and as regards the rights and duties involved .
They also provide effective protection against the arbitrary use of and the abuse of power and against corruption
