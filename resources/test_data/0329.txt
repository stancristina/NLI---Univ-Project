Article 87( 2 ) of the Treaty must also be implemented as a matter of urgency , with the aim of granting appropriate financial aid to all affected sectors .
I wish to tell you that the best thing that Europe can do at the present time for Portugal – the country that I know best – is to offer a swift and effective response to the populations affected , of which there are many throughout my country .
The forest fire disaster has thus far given us some terrible statistics ; the fires have burnt more than 240 000 hectares !
The flames travelled 20 km in three hours .
The fight against disasters must be made an EU priority .
Let us raise the flags of confidence in the present and hope for the future .
There have been 18 fatalities in Portugal , including one Pedro Figueiredo , a dedicated firefighter from Oliveira de Azeméis , who was due to run in the October local elections on the basis of his extraordinary civic and community dedication .
I was similarly surprised by the decision taken by the Council of Ministers in June to scrap the firebreak subsidy .
Our desire is to work with others to ensure that this agenda is implemented rigorously and consistently until such time as we achieve security .
We must also set up a temporary committee of inquiry in order to raise our awareness of these realities .
We naturally feel that workers ’ health must be protected , and therefore have difficulty in accepting the Council Presidency’s compromise .
Against this backdrop , the creation of the European Gender Institute is of major importance ; it should be granted greater powers and its own financial resources , more so than the Commission is currently proposing .
This new regulation is the result of the implementation of the second reform package of the CAP agreed in April 2004 .
A certain amount of time must be given in order to develop the new permanent system .
On the basis of that principle , we feel that the system could be used as an alternative to the US-dominated Global Positioning System ( GPS) .
It has taken on great importance for Europe , given that it is the first satellite radionavigation and positioning system in the world designed specifically for civil purposes .
The various bilateral agreements established in the area of air services are the main instruments for ensuring that our relations with third countries run smoothly , particularly with regard to issues of air safety .
As a result of this and of the fact that the Court of Justice of the European Communities has recognised the Community’s exclusive competence in this field , the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with third countries with a view to replacing certain provisions in existing bilateral agreements with Community agreements .
I also welcome the use of Vessel Detection Systems (VDS ) and the introduction of an electronic logbook mechanism .
We have always had our doubts about the introduction of this system , from the point of view of both respect for sovereignty and the cost and effectiveness of such a system .
It will lead to improvements in the quality of information and in the effectiveness of fisheries resources management .     .
The readmission agreements between the European Community and third countries are of key importance to the European strategy to combat illegal immigration .
It is also important that we look carefully into how we can provide support for the reintegration process , in such a way that people can return on a sustainable basis .     .
Otherwise we would be promoting organised violations and the formation of illegal economic organisations offering an illegal service .
The amendments tabled in the report before us are worthy of our support , firstly because it is simply not logical solely to promote competition for its own sake – especially when that competition is realised in a way that is unfair or does not respect rules that we believe are of key importance – and secondly because the purpose of granting aid should be to promote development and not to promote developed economies and our competitors .
The Council has accepted a number of amendments adopted at first reading by Parliament .
In this context , the Commission has emphasised the importance of simplifying and rationalising the current situation , by proposing an integrated programme for employment and social solidarity ( PROGRESS) .
Pre-empting the agreement and its entry into force , the major multinational retailers and importers quickly attempted to derail it .
Although I am an advocate of the virtues of a capitalist economy and the open market , we must understand that if we do not protect the interests of our firms with competitive potential – and in the Portuguese textile industry there are a number of examples of competitive potential – we will soon be seeing a country of consumers that produces nothing ; and if you produce nothing , you cannot consume .
In this context , the time has come to consider whether , on the one hand , the rules of a liberal economy should be followed to the letter , or , on the other hand , whether circumstances are in place that would justify some sort of regulatory intervention to protect the Community’s interests .
It also reflects the mid-term review of the Lisbon Strategy and the funds involved in its implementation .
At this rate , how can we hope to establish a more social and more competitive Europe ?
What is needed is a sea change of mentality in terms of competitiveness and the production of content , with a view to rejecting the illegal and harmful products that are increasingly invading all audiovisual areas and what are referred to as online services .
This , for me
