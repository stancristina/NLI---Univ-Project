Enlargement , with the possible opening of negotiations with Turkey , requires decisions , the consequences of which will be decisive .
How could it ever be possible for a candidate country to be allowed not to recognise the existence of another Member State and for this issue not to be clearly laid down at the summit ?
The European Union must open a window for the safeguarding of the basic principles of its very existence and call for the application of this minimum framework of obligations and must also open a window for the simple citizens by showing that it does not take decisions using two sets of standards and two yardsticks .
Consequently , I consider it very important – as you mention in the conclusions – that the relevant agreements and treaties be signed early on in 2005 .
I would also like to make a couple of positive remarks on what you have to say about the financial perspectives .
It is here to stay , we shall face new challenges every time and the Council , the European Parliament and the European Commission will therefore need to cooperate closely in order to combat this phenomenon .     – Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I feel that everyone – citizens and politicians alike – is living through an historic era , because the decision which the European Council is expected to take on accession negotiations with Turkey will be a landmark for Turkey itself , the European Union and our region as a whole .
Arguments have been expressed for and against the accession of Turkey to saturation point over recent days .
The other issue I wanted to mention is that the Council should , at long last , draw up a long-term plan for our foreign relations with decisiveness , cohesion , properly coordinated objectives and reliable financing .
As Article 38 rightly says , a solution can be found on the basis of the principles upon which the EU is founded .
Only those who are obedient and organised are accepted as necessary at the altar of the 'competitiveness ' of the European monopolies .
The text is teeming with references to human rights , accompanied by proposals and policies which violate them .
In the name of a non-existent realism , the recommendation distorts the nature of the problem from a social to a medical problem , something which results in submission and defeatism .
The connection between drug trafficking and the funding of so-called terrorism gives arguments to imperialist propaganda and is becoming an alibi before the people .
We do not demonstrate any tolerance of the drug culture .
Now to the subject in hand .
Nonetheless , it should be pointed out that there needs to be a constant and conscious effort on the part of the Bulgarian authorities to adapt pending full integration .
The policies and actions of the European Union to promote trans-national , trans-regional and cross-border cooperation and to combat the repercussions of enlargement on development and employment in border regions should be continued and reinforced .
The consequences of the integration process and of the humiliating terms accepted by the governments of these countries are already visible .
Purchasing power in Romania is 60 % of what it was in 1989 .
The accession of Bulgaria and Romania will close the circle of enlargement opened with the ten new countries .
Reactors 3 and 4 at the Kozloduy nuclear power station must close in 2006 , in accordance with the commitment given by the Bulgarian authorities , and modernisation of nuclear installations with Community financing from the PHARE programme and from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development must continue normally .
The European Commission must use the mechanisms provided for , with annual evaluation reports and safeguarding clauses , to monitor closely the efficient application of the and safeguard Community interests , even after the accession of Bulgaria on 1 January 2007 .     – Mr President , maybe Bulgaria and Romania are being wronged by our debating Turkey 's accession prospects over the last few days in the European Parliament – and shall also be doing so in the European Union , at the European Council , in a few days ' time .
Nonetheless , the new President will have to achieve the strong backing of parliament if he is to honour immediately the commitments which Romania has given to the European Union .
In addition , further measures need to be taken in the sectors of border controls , asylum and immigration policy and more drastic action to combat organised crime and corruption .
I am aware of the fact that Greece proposed certain amendments in order to accept this directive .
My country , Greece , is currently experiencing immense anxiety as the result of the hijacking of a bus with several hostages whose lives are in danger .
This programme expires in a few days , on 31 December 2004 , and we need to approve this proposal which I have prepared , in order to avoid a gap until such time as the new programme is prepared .
That is why I support the Commission proposal to prolong this programme for the next two years , just as I support the Commission proposal on the necessary increase in the budget for the action programme in the field of civil protection from EUR 1.5 million annually , which was the amount in 2004 , to EUR 2.4 million annually for the next two years .
Unfortunately , it would appear that the Council of Ministers does not have the same perception as we have in the European Parliament and in the Commission , and the Council also needs to understand that the decisions which we take in order to do certain things also need the money necessary for their implementation .
