% during the 1994-1999 period .
Bangladesh is very dependent on foreign aid .
The EU is a major provider of aid-17 % of all funds .
The EU is its biggest trading partner .
In 1998 we imported 45 % of its exports .
Bangladesh has a trade surplus with the EU.
Almost a billion euros have been provided by the EU since 1976 for EU-financed projects : EUR 660 million were provided for food and humanitarian aid ; EUR 185 million were provided for the alleviation of poverty and for agriculture .
I fully endorse the objectives of the EU-financed programmes to : Help raise the incomes and improve the food security of the poor ; help to improve access of very poor women and children to quality health and public health services ; improve the access of these children to education .
This is of fundamental importance to the future of Bangladesh .
I was particularly pleased that Bangladesh joined the ILO ' s programme for the abolition of child labour in 1984 and that « significant progress » has been recorded since then .
I welcome these efforts and look forward to further progress in this regard .
I want to fully endorse the main objectives of the agreement , namely : support for sustainable economic development , especially as regards the poorest in society , women and children .
The Development Committee ' s resolution stresses the importance of the up-coming general election in Bangladesh in November of this year .
The European Union should respond favourably to the invitations received from both the government and the opposition to send election monitors as was the case in the 1996 and 1991 general elections .
I hope that members of the European Parliament will form part of the team .
Newton Dunn report ( A5-0392/2000 )
.
For the past eighteen months , British Conservatives have been calling for the Commission to introduce more efficient financial management and administrative procedures so that it can deliver external assistance and implement programmes , such as mine action , urgently in time of crisis or when lives are at stake .
They support proposals with these objectives in mind and therefore welcome the Commission initiative for a Rapid Reaction Facility ( or Mechanism ) , in spite of its confusing title and some unnecessarily politically-correct elements .
Their fundamental objection is to the amendments which seek to use this proposal as a vehicle for establishing a " European Public Security Force " .
This concept , for some sort of European gendarmerie , has far-reaching implications and no place in the Commission proposal under discussion .
We were prepared to support the Commission proposal if it did not contain these amendments ( 9 or 39 ) but abstain if they were included .
Oomen-Ruijten report ( A5-0338/2000 )
.
I believe that the report from our Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is most balanced and should be welcomed .
As a representative of a rural constituency , I am acutely aware of the concerns expressed by farmers over the very future of farming in Ireland .
It seems incredible but it is true , that in Ireland , where agriculture has long been one of the economic bases of the country , farmers are now beginning to wonder whether their sons or daughters will be able to carry on the family tradition .
Mr Parish ' s report is very timely , and the study on " The Future of Young Farmers in the European Union " by independent consultants which was commissioned at his request at the beginning of last year provides a much-needed focus on the whole issue .
Young farmers are an essential part of the farming future .
They perform a very important role in the social life of villages and rural communities , promoting a whole range of activities and participating in local associations .
Farmers help to promote a healthy and prosperous countryside by maintaining the landscape .
In Ireland the National Development Plan for 2000-2006 provides a wide range of measures which will assist young farmers embarking on their farming career .
These include a new enhanced Scheme of Installation Aid to encourage the taking-over of farms by younger farmers and assist young farmers as they first set up in farming .
Some £30 million has been provided for this scheme , which I hope will shortly be approved by the Commission .
In addition , a comprehensive range of tax incentives are in place , aimed at reducing the cost of ownership transfer .
These incentives include Stock Relief , Stamp Duty , Capital Acquisition and Probate Tax .
Coupled with the Early Retirement Scheme , it is clear that the supports available to young farmers setting out on a career in agriculture will be of considerable benefit , and these measures should assist in the earlier and more efficient transfer of land to younger farmers .
Many young farmers taking over a holding have to make necessary on-farm investments in order to optimise production efficiency and to ensure the economic sustainability of their holdings .
In this regard some GBP 230 million have been provided for on-farm investment under the National Development Plan .
Investment schemes will cover Farm Waste Management , Improvement in Dairy Hygiene Standards and Housing and Handling Facilities for Alternative Enterprises .
These Schemes will be open to an increased number of part-time and full-time farmers , including young trained farmers , and will contribute to securing the viability of many farmers .
They will focus in particular on young farmers .
It should also be noted that the nature of these schemes shows a clear commitment to the protection of the environment , an issue which will figure strongly in the future development of both Irish and European agriculture .
To conclude , it is imperative that we , at European level , address ourselves towards ensuring a future for European agriculture .
