.
Now we have the Internet and we can introduce this process in the European Parliament .
This week we are having another very important debate on this subject , as we are discussing with Mr Solana the issue of Council reform and transparency , where we will have to defend , for example , the broad definition of legislation .
It is high time we pointed out that these names are not secret ; they are not secret individuals , and their names may indeed be made known to the public .
Parliament thus also takes the view that , while , on the one hand , the protection of privacy is obviously important , on the other hand , the common interest and the right of access to information also require names to be made public , subject to certain conditions .
Mr President , on behalf of the ELDR Group , I wish to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Foster , for the excellent way in which she has drafted the proposal with regard to this important matter .
It is therefore reasonable for our committee to propose that some key amendments be revised even though we are now on the home straight .
The amendment makes the wording more specific in such a way that at the same time it increases flexibility with regard to the types of aircraft being used .
It is important .
If there is a constant threat of an EU inspection , standards tend to be kept up .
In addition we have to ensure that matters drawn attention to after the inspection are actually put right .
Action taken must be in proportion to what is reasonable for each country .
Mr President , our rapporteur , Mrs Berger , has very convincingly shown that the Council common position contains a considerable number of Parliament 's demands from the first reading .
It might be said that we have now made a good start with regard to guaranteeing consumer protection in the internal market in financial services , and we can definitely go further in this at a later date .
It is quite proper that the principle of minimum harmonisation is now being applied .
I do not believe that the internal market will come to any particular harm as a result .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of my group I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Torres Marques , for the thorough preparatory work she has done with regard to this important matter .
As a growth industry it can also create jobs in regions where it would be very hard to do so otherwise .
I would also like to stress how important it is that all regions and citizens of the European Union keep up with developments in the information technology field and that broadband networks should extend to all companies in the tourist industry .
Our group would nevertheless like to emphasise the importance of the principle of subsidiarity with regard to the tourist industry and therefore supports the notion of limited action within the framework of the EU.
In my opinion a reduction in VAT in the tourist industry is justified , but many members of our group take a wary view of matters of taxation , as they are largely the business of the Member States .
Mr President , Commissioner , the way the age structure of the population is developing everywhere in Europe means that today 's youth will really have to carry the burden of responsibility for tomorrow .
It is gratifying that the Commission should have tried to implement European governance in practice and is offering young people opportunities to influence the decisions that relate to them .
It is not enough that young people are merely listened to .
We have to look for workable solutions to the problems that young people feel are serious .
Closely linked to this is the fact that deprivation tends to pass from one generation to the next .
We are looking at very fundamental questions of democracy when people are not interested in voting .
The structures in place have not yet , in themselves , inspired any motivation to exercise influence .
The Commission 's White Paper is an excellent start to developments in youth policy .
We also need concrete action and the necessary funds , just as the rapporteur , Mrs Gr√∂ner stressed .
For years now she has done some really excellent work to promote sport and physical education .
It is regrettable that sport has no legal basis in Community legislation .
Young people who go in for sport must be included in the EU 's various exchange programmes .
Unquestionably , sport is also of educational importance , as the report mentions .
For this reason I hope that the status of sport in the school curriculum will be seriously reconsidered .
Resources for these afternoon activities must also be significantly increased .
At the same time they are being offered something meaningful to do and social problems and exclusion are being prevented .
Mr President , Mr Stenmarck has drawn up a very rational and balanced estimate of Parliament 's estimated revenue and expenditure for the next financial year and my sincerest thanks go to him for that .
For that reason the rapporteur has set aside considerable sums of money for the new Member State 's admission to the EU.
The rapporteur is proposing that EUR 32 million is needed for enlargement immediately and a further EUR 51 million for a special reserve .
The language issue is one of the hardest matters to deal with .
This places special demands on the European Parliament with regard to interpreting .
For example , Finnish is interpreted first into English , say , and only then into Greek .
Another crucial problem is the support of Parliament 's core activities .
