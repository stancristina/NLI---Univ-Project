I say it is worthy of praise because fundamentally , although this document appears to be written with a light touch , it defends the universality of knowledge and wisdom to the hilt .
Likewise , I have called for there to be information signs in museums in more than one language of the Union , in several languages of the Union .
Furthermore , the very differences which make up what we so often call our cultural diversity demonstrate the wealth of interpretation and ways of living with a single common heritage .
I believe in this integrated approach and I am , therefore , concerned much less about the legal basis of the reports than about the real focus of their content and about how cooperation is undertaken between the various Community committees and institutions .
With regard to the issue of lindane , I believe that it is very good that it has moved to Annex I as a prohibited substance and that its use may be permitted under certain also very strict conditions , as proposed in the agreement .
I am not going to talk about discrimination – other Members have done that already – but I will say that I believe violence against women is a problem throughout the world , and particularly in my State , and that both the institutions and society must accept that it is necessary to resolve it .
Mr van Boven said at last week 's press conference that incommunicado detention 'not only creates the conditions for torture to take place ' , the measure itself can constitute 'cruel , merciless treatment ' .     Mr President , although it appears that some people 's shame and capacity to provoke knows no limits , I am always amazed that the only Member of this House who has not been able to condemn a single one of the attacks carried out by his friends , the cowardly murderers of the terrorist group ETA , should refer to an apparent defence of human rights .
I would also like to refer very briefly to the report presented by Mrs Bastos on reconciling work and family life .
The success must be operational and lasting .
Let us not forget that these borders , as Robert Schuman said , were Europe 's historical scars .
In December , the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market voted for a text , which is not going to be approved today , but rather certain amendments are going to be approved which differ radically from what was voted for in that meeting of the committee .
I believe it is no mistake to say that the text approved is going to be the laughing stock of commentators and is going to cause many difficulties for the Member States when it comes to incorporating it into their internal law .
The recently signed Interinstitutional Agreement intends to eliminate these difficulties , but we know that that is going to be very difficult to achieve in practice .
We are talking about a right relating to the application or implementation of the substantive content .
One of them relates to commercial purposes .
It is true that we have modified the Commission 's proposal , which was restricted to acts carried out for commercial purposes .
There are many other aspects that we have revised from the Commission 's initial proposal , such as , for example , the reduction of procedures and costs for the applicant , in order to speed up and guarantee respect for their intellectual property rights ; the simplification of the guarantees to be provided by the applicant in the event of defending their industrial or intellectual property rights ; the establishment of compensation in the event of an infringement of industrial or intellectual property and , finally , considerations relating to the destruction of objects used for counterfeiting or the counterfeit objects themselves .
But the emphasis on exclusively technical considerations or on the economic weight of a certain legislative measure may not correspond to the need to adopt a piece of legislation .
If , for example , the European Parliament cannot oppose the technocratic procedures for adopting decisions by means of small groups in the form of self-regulation or co-regulation , I do not know what role it can play .
But it must be made clear that Israel cannot continue to unilaterally apply the Association Agreement to settlements which must disappear in order for peace to be possible .
If we want to have credibility , we should play positively , and if we want to replace or , at least , compensate for the influence of the United States – which many here talk about – over Israel , and if we want Israel to trust in Europe , what we cannot do is always seek to castigate .
Furthermore , with a policy of this type , subsequent investment by the Palestinians in order to incorporate these territories will be much greater .
And the future of Europe is going to depend very much on the education received by these young people .
If in the Autumn – September or October – Parliament gives its opinion and it is in favour , does that mean that in 2005 the agency could be operational or that all the procedures for putting it into operation could be finished , if all the procedures can be carried out on the basis of the new membership of Parliament ?     Mr President , Commissioner , you know that the basis used for this reform contains out-of-date quotas with regard to Spain .
If the regions of Asturias and Castilla y León present it with a new project which respects all natural areas and which conform
