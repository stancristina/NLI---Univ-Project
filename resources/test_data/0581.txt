Sustainability should be the basic principle , enabling us to ensure that the EU moves forward and thinks both in the long-term and globally .
Why is there now a lack of courage in Finland ?
On the same day as we visited the Prime Minister in Helsinki he got his President to sign the draft Constitution , to which she is opposed .
I think that Mr Vanhanen should be hiding behind his prime ministerial gown .
Make the requirement for a referendum in every Member State a condition of acceptance by Finland , thus putting into practice the transparency you heralded .
Put all the documents from the entire legislation process on the website .
Open up all meetings to the public unless a majority of the countries actively request this not to be done .
Put it to the next meeting of the Council of Ministers .
The draft can be adopted by a simple majority of the 25 Member States .
I call on our Finnish President-in-Office to be brave and stand by his signature .
The peoples of the whole of Europe would love him if he were the one to open the locked doors to this remote Union .
I fully support your proposal to change cooperation in legal affairs so that we will now have majority decision-making .
As I say , I have a request for you , Mr Vanhanen , from one Liberal to another , so to speak .
Make sure that we do not end up on a slippery slope .
There are many worrying signs .
We must be vigilant in ensuring that our fundamental freedoms are not violated and that we do not compromise our rights unduly for the sake of the fight against terrorism .
There is a very fine balance to be struck here , so think about this when you get down to work .
Mr Barroso , from one small country to another : have a good match tonight and may the best team win !     Mr President , with all the nuclear power stations we have in Europe , we are all in greater danger than we think – in Denmark , too , which has in fact declined to adopt nuclear power .
The person formerly responsible for security there , Lars-Olov Höglund , has said of this power station that it was pure luck that it did not go into meltdown at the beginning of this August .
It was also a week before either the Swedish public or operators of similar power stations in other countries were made aware of the event .
That this is the case in Sweden’s otherwise very open society is , of course , also somewhat alarming .
There is a lack of information where nuclear power is concerned .
The important lesson to be learned from this episode is that nuclear power is not safe and never will be .
We must ensure that we put a stop to this development as quickly as possible .     Madam President , this proposal will fortunately not be implemented .
It is the purchase of cars that determines how many cars will be driven .
A high registration tax is therefore a very good thing if we want to limit the number of cars .
Clearly , a registration tax of this kind , as well as an annual tax , should be established on the basis of consumption .
A noticeable difference has been made where proper tax increases have been implemented .
We are seeing many more cars , and with proportionality there will be more cars that are significantly more polluting and that consume more energy .
In actual fact , there is a lot to suggest that Volkswagen and other representatives of the car industry have successfully got a handle on this matter , and when I hear the car industry lobbying really hard in Denmark to have registration tax abolished , I know that it is , of course , because they are counting on selling more cars as a result .
They are not counting on selling cleaner cars or cars that consume less energy .
I would therefore thank you for not allowing this proposal to be implemented .
Madam President , I apologise for being late .
I have lost my luggage , so I have no clothes or make-up and look pale and ugly , but I hope that is alright !
Madam President , thank you for your contributions , and many thanks too on behalf of the Commissioner .
I have to say that my country , Denmark , does not support the Commission ’s proposal .
I should like to thank the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for its considerable support .
I should also like to thank you for your sound amendments and thank the large majority that has supported me .
I should like to discuss a number of points that I think it is important to emphasise before we vote tomorrow .
It is constructive because it takes account of the environment .
In the committee , we have gone a step further than in the Commission ’s original proposal , since the Commission only wanted an annual tax based on CO2 emissions .
In my report I therefore recommend that the tax be based on all pollutants and particles detrimental to air quality .
Hopefully , the proposal will therefore create an incentive for the car industry to produce cars that consume less petrol and cause less pollution .
At present there are 25 different tax systems with 25 different ways of calculating car taxes .
There is a risk of double taxation , and car owners often have to pay proportionately much more on their used cars when they transport them from one Member State to another .
That is simply unacceptable .
It is also important from the committee’s point of view to emphasise that we
