authorities ' request for the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of our colleague in this House , Mr Ribeiro Campos .
The situations in the Member States are very diverse : no parliamentary immunity in the UK, and others with a totally different type of parliamentary immunity .
An MEP is a normal citizen in the eyes of the law , but he or she is also a representative of the people and , as such , should be protected against legal proceedings which might compromise , not themselves , but what they represent - compromising the citizens of Europe , in fact .
I think the verbatim report of proceedings should record the fact that Mr Vandergheist , whom I see sitting here , has worked magnificently .
In that sense , we must contradict the odd statement which has been made , such as that Mr Rothley wanted to accept the text at first reading .
That has been repeated several times , and I can only endorse the words of Mr Barzanti , Mrs Mosiek-Urbahn , Mr Pompidou and Ms Oddy .
Obviously , if anyone obtains an element fraudulently and patents it , the Member State 's substantive laws will come into play .
Article 6 establishes , for the first time in an international text , protection for the embryo as contained in the Oviedo Convention on Bioethics , which is expected to come into effect subsequently .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I too want to congratulate Mr Pirker on his excellent report .
So we need to develop uniform programmes and models to promote effective cooperation measures between government authorities .
Its consumption is linked to 30 % of all cancers .
But there are too many financial interests behind it , as was made patently clear by the scandalous attempt at an agreement on the part of the North American tobacco companies .
Mr President , our group supports the positions of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection and Mr Cabrol - which are the same - in the sense that we reject all the amendments which could weaken the Council 's common position .
We have to look again at tobacco labelling and the addictive nature of additives .
And in committee , I voted along with all my colleagues from all the political groups , in a majority decision that this is not the right legal basis .
The approach taken by the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens ' Rights has been strictly political rather than juridical - juridical too , but strictly political .
What is the added value of the action planned by the Community , and what would be the cost of an alternative action ?
I think it would be better to tackle it Treaty in hand and adopt , with the correct legal basis , measures appropriate to the objective being sought .
That is our culture and our civilization .
It is hardly complied with at all .
And though it may seem you are facing the danger alone - like Gary Cooper - do not believe it !
We have to consider on the one hand the protection of minors from certain contents which can affect their physical or moral development and , on the other hand , the protection of human dignity from illegal content , which is banned throughout society , regardless of the age of the potential recipients , and which goes against the very foundations of society : specifically , as I said , our dignity .
At least we agree that it is worth a try .
My second comment concerns its ties to the various choices for regional integration and economic blocs .
But it would also be a good thing to have a fairer distribution of the economic boom and the current benefits .
So we have several months ahead of us , and during that time Parliament will have the chance to follow the negotiations and their progress closely , and make a statement on the final result once negotiations have been completed .
We will be able to help with this .
Back in 1995 , this Parliament recognized the need to broaden and deepen the scope of the agreement which still governs relations between the EU and Mexico because that agreement , dating from April 1991 , does not satisfactorily address the new needs of the signatories .
It is certainly a very serious report .
As regards the hearings held in the European Parliament , I want to say that the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party supports the proposals in the report presented by Mrs Randzio-Plath , the chairman of the Subcommittee on Monetary Affairs .
It stresses the autonomy and independence of the Central Bank , which should be immune to all sorts of pressures or political instructions .
The second point I want to mention is of particular importance to Parliament , especially for those Members of this House who are of a progressive or left-wing persuasion .
That is an essential point , as we have often said .
In that context , we all know that the moment of truth has not yet arrived , even though , in an exemplary demonstration of transparency on the part of the Commission , the implementation figures for the budgetary planning for the Mediterranean are currently available on the Internet .
The Court of Auditors ' report on financial and technical cooperation with Mediterranean third countries which was presented a few weeks ago may give rise to doubts , for example about the Commission failing to provide enough human resources to implement the programmes , and about the lack of clarity between the Commission 's various services on the one hand , and between the Commission 's headquarters in Brussels and the territorial delegations , on the other .
