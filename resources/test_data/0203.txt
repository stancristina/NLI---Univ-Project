is pessimistic .
We are on the brink of an historic occasion where the risks are great , but so are the opportunities .
Finally , I would like to mention two other points : the former Yugoslavia and crime .
Lastly , as other Members have reminded us , we must deal with society as well as infrastructures .
Despite the fact that there may now be a way of safeguarding this capital - the sweat of the brows of the workers - by capitalising pension funds , we are told that we must not do this , because the national governments want to get their hands on private pension funds as well .
The Commission ' s proposal is too similar to the proposal of the Council of Ministers , which does not consider it necessary to allocate part of the budget to a policy of cooperation and protection of the Community ' s primary producers in accordance with WTO negotiations .
Rather than adapting to the WTO system , we should endeavour to reform it without giving in to blackmail by US multinationals which make a profit out of exploiting poor countries .
Madam President , the French text takes precedence .
The Prodi Commission has undertaken a vast reform , which is necessary in order to modernise the European civil service and to reorganise its structures in preparation for the many challenges which it will have to face over the next few years .
But what a contradiction .
And that is essential .
I hope that when the embargo imposed on Iraq is lifted , this will be the end of all embargoes everywhere throughout the world .
And yet he has had to endure great suffering .
We call for an end to this policy of turning a blind eye to events in China , and for the European Union to join the American initiative without worrying about losing choice economic opportunities , and to cease this silent and tolerant stance towards the continuous violations of human rights in China , and , in particular , Tibet .
But this is the crux of the matter : until the right of self-determination is declared and applied everywhere , we will continue to witness such situations and we will continue to debate and adopt resolutions , but , as Mr Sakellariou said , sadly , nothing will change .
Moreover , I believe that the three elements which are highlighted as positive in this resolution - the stances adopted by Janet Reno , the governor of Illinois and the U.S. Justice Department - should be brought to the attention of the Americans .
I am not , therefore , alone in hoping that , tomorrow , the 15 governments will at last decide to take social security and pensions in hand at European level , for this is the only way to prevent the current breakdown of the systems .
Mr President , I may have been accused of being subversive , but other people appear to disregard the Rules of Procedure .
A request to test the quorum should not be made at the start of the debate but when we vote .
Of course , there are other structures which are public nuisances - landfill waste sites , for example , which are created from old quarries with no planning - but , in the case of airports , we see the consequences every day , or rather we hear them , for they fill our ears rather than offending our eyes .
I welcomed the Commission ' s remarks regarding a European legislative framework .
Local authority involvement is therefore important , although , I must stress , it needs to be within a general European legislative framework .
This is neither the time nor the place for me to criticise this government , but I would like to ask the Commissioner whether the Commission took into account the fact that neighbouring countries , as well as the Serbian civilian population , were being penalised when it decided to defer appropriations on purely political grounds .
I would nevertheless like to take the opportunity afforded by the explanation of vote to remind the House that there is a need for Parliament and the Council to make radical changes to the legislation on milk quotas as well as to the legislation governing the distribution of agricultural produce , regulated within the European Community , in terms of the quantity produced and how it is marketed .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the ELDR Group supports the Hatzidakis report .
For this reason , we also consider that appropriations set aside for these projects must not exceed 50 % and that , after due analysis , the amounts still available for projects on which little progress has been made could be recouped and used for other projects with the same priorities , including environmental priorities .
Then there is a problem of competition , particularly competition from the United States in the form of those huge carriers which are governed by standardised legislation which , I regret , is lacking in the European Union , both in the sphere of air traffic control - with the result that operational standardisation is lacking as well as legislative standardisation - and as regards the recognition of professional qualifications .
It may be that the decisions you adopted this morning have in some way assuaged the Group ' s thirst for knowledge , but this Chamber appears to be unusually empty for a debate on such a major issue .
I feel that this is also a question which , although it does not form part of our question for an oral answer , would merit a debate at another time in its own right .
We are witnessing a new industrial revolution .
All these areas will have to evolve , and , in many cases , change completely .
