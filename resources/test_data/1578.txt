I have just mentioned and then we would be well advised not just to say blindly that we cannot dictate choices to the hauliers .
The major problem is how the quality , safety and speed of public transport can be improved so that the car user has a genuine alternative .
The resolution has , surprisingly enough with the cooperation of the rapporteur , become unfortunately an over lengthy list of all kinds of ideas and desiderata .
On the contrary , public opinion in Europe as a whole has come out strongly in favour of summertime .
That just does not make sense .
That was in the old days when the EEC was still small and unspoiled .
But that does not mean to say that for reasons of traffic or other practical purposes one single time in Europe would not be simpler .
Summertime must be retained in all Member States of the European Union in its present composition .
Then our erstwhile colleague Mr Pelttari took over as the conference was to take place in Finland .
Let us hope that a useful exchange of views can take place and that these conferences do not become an interminable repetitive obligation but only occur when there is something worthwhile to discuss .
I think it essential that these demands should also apply to vehicles from non-EU countries which use our roads .
We cannot go to Helsinki if there is not a considerable improvement in those matters .
Any debate on employment covers not only jobs as such but also flexibility , training and education , taxation , research and development , economic growth in particular and social development .
This has been completely ignored in the Wolf report .
How can we manage to restore jobs in industry in the Union ?
I would also like to raise the question of structural unemployment but I have run out of speaking time .
But when we talk about modernisation then we should be brave enough to tackle the tricky issues and here I disagree with Mr Vieira that we should not be thinking in terms of shifting taxing labour to other aims .
One is the question of the development of the countryside and the other is urban policy .
Let me just remind you of the Delors White Paper , for example , the Santer confidence pact , the annual reports on employment and the reports from the Council of Ministers of Social Affairs and of Finance .
The rapporteur , Mr Wolf , is on the right track when he criticises the current macro-economic approach .
But despite this there is a feeling here of déjà vu , of keeping a welfare Europe with a social face by means of all the earlier White Papers , European Councils and stability pacts .
The Ribeiro report takes a concrete step beyond national borders in Europe , but there are still contradictions in our approach here and there .
Mr President , I appreciate that you want to go through the votes quickly and I respect that .
There were considerable differences of opinion even here in Parliament , and it has to be said that under the current conciliation procedure , a small minority which may have no knowledge of the issue at stake can impose its will on a much larger majority .
This action plan is rather more realistic and pragmatic than was originally proposed .
I would point out - for the benefit of Mr De Coene - that when there was some question of extending the programme by adding a number of specific projects , which the PPE Group voted against at the time because we felt that it was not consistent with the legal basis , the Council went on to demonstrate that what you wanted to do was not possible , despite everything that was said about me in the Dutch press .
There may yet be a middle way .
I am therefore delighted that the final text produced by the committee offers scope for a pragmatic and humane approach which focuses on prevention and risk-limitation .
The European Union does have a role to play in the fight against drugs , but not as some kind of large-scale needle exchange service .
The politically sensitive amendments designed to impose a permissive drugs policy or a policy of damage-limitation on the Member States have been toned down , I am glad to say .
Mr President , there is something I should like to point out here , since Mrs Oomen-Ruijten has twice now claimed in this debate that I have put my name to a motion for a resolution on legalizing drugs .
But there is no point in providing information on food labels if consumers cannot read them because they are in a language they do not know .
I only hope now that the Commission will bear in mind the 'sauce béarnaise ' judgment when it performs its role as guardian of the Treaties on this issue .
I have suggested three or four times now that we should have another monitor over here , but it seems that this is not possible .
Could I ask Commissioner Monti to confirm this in his answer to the House ?
We are not asking for more money .
That is why the PPE Group is very much in favour of allowing individual membership , and we have tabled an amendment to this effect .
But we also think that decisions in the European parties must be taken by majority voting .
Finally , I hope that the seeds sown by the Tsatsos report will produce a flourishing political life in Europe .
Firstly , there is the idea of giving social dialogue a more established position in the work of the institutions .
The Herzog report has turned out to be an important one .
