This is a regime in which Christians are persecuted , alcohol is banned , western clothes are banned and veils must be worn , and all of this is happening with the complicity of the British troops on the ground .
I should like to highlight the fact that poverty and unemployment , combined with a strong patriarchal tradition , are the main causes of prostitution , trafficking in women and violence against women .
As Mrs Karamanou rightly points out , however , problems do exist that are not solely related to women .
In light of all of these points , I abstained in the vote on the resolution .
We must mobilise , as swiftly and effectively as possible , the resources required to clear mined areas , to help with the social and economic rehabilitation of victims and to destroy stockpiles of anti-personnel mines .
We are thus forced to fight to defend derogations relating to public services , whilst they ought to be an absolute priority , a key instrument towards ensuring that human rights are respected and that we establish a Europe based on economic and social cohesion and solidarity .
They show contempt for the rule of law in force , both in the European Union and in the USA .
For this reason alone , the President and his Commission deserves Parliament’s political censure .
Stateless nations , such as mine , Galicia , are still not recognised as such in the draft Constitution .
If we continue this way , we will not be moving towards a social Europe .
They are achievements and not gifts , achievements that must be fought for and not gifts that are gratefully received , principles that we want to keep and to ensure that they do not suffer a slow and complete demise .
We did not want ridiculous budgetary criteria to be imposed , or accounts of benefactors ’ sacrifices and beneficiaries ’ gains ; what we wanted from the policy was for it to promote cooperation and the transfer of means , with mutual respect and benefits for all .
From this side of the House , I welcome the enlarged Europe and the concept of neighbourhood – as a European model for living and not a symbol of window-dressing rhetoric – which will be the path to follow , provided that we maximise the wealth of various situations institutionally , economically , socially , culturally , and not the ideological straitjacket of an omnipotent paradigm , of an omnipotent neo-liberal , federal and militarised Constitution , on the pretext of the spectre of a threat to security .
Those expectations are greater still against the backdrop of an enlarged Europe of 455 million inhabitants .
It is important that we address those fears rationally .
A further aspect that has been brought to the fore by the media concerns the fear of a massive movement of new citizens across Europe .
Enlargement represents a major challenge for certain policies , such as tightening external border controls .
Accordingly , we must improve certain measures contained in procedural law , such as those provided for in the framework decision on procedural safeguards in criminal proceedings , which the Commission has just submitted to the Council .
Judicial control must be improved , extending the Court of Justice’s competence and granting the Commission powers commonly used in infringement cases .
Our Union , now enlarged to twenty-five countries , has greater political , geographical and economic substance .
Nevertheless , I should once again like to highlight at this juncture that , if security is to be strengthened , this must always be in compliance with the other two components of our European area , which are freedom and justice . 1 May also saw great change in the area of Justice and Home Affairs .
Firstly , on a personal level , I would like to thank those Members of Parliament who addressed kind words to me .
Finally , Mr President , due to the fact that you personally have chaired most of the meetings I have attended in this Parliament , I feel privileged to that you have been my private chairman !
We are united in our diversity – national , regional , cultural , linguistic and political .
As Jean Monnet said , ‘ ’ The first of May was an event of historic proportions with the accession of ten new Member States .
I am conscious that one of the main tasks of the President of the Commission is to manage the dynamic consensus that Europe needs .
The formula that he is proposing continues to be based on the Lisbon strategy , but the only decisions taken there that have elicited a positive response have been liberalisation and privatisation .
Nevertheless , they did not win .
I would quite simply say that we need a Delors-style Commission , a Commission with leadership and ambition , but also an effective Commission .
I know you well enough to say that you have the qualities needed to be President of the Commission and I am also sufficiently independently minded to say that quite openly .
At the very least I would like to respond to those who have expressed reservations about my candidacy .
Some honourable Members , however , link the issue of Iraq with other concerns , in particular relations between Europe and the United States , and European security and defence policy , to which I am firmly committed .
If I am elected President of the Commission I will defend the general interests of Europe and the common good of Europe , and I will not accept Europe being treated as a second-rate power in any area whatsoever .
What is more , as Minister for Foreign Affairs , I had the honour of signing some of the instruments
