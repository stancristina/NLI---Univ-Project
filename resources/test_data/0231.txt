that this development could also extend to the majority of other countries , the outcome being referendums everywhere .
We are now debating whether the EU institutions should adopt a special communications strategy to convince the electorate of the Constitution’s merits .
This is not something they have been able to do .
The Council has only managed to print a number of unreadable versions containing neither indices nor the minority opinion that we in the Convention were expressly promised would be included .
The European Parliament could take over the task that the Council and the Commission have not carried out , in spite of their wealth of resources .
The various groups ’ opinions could be appended to the official texts so that the voters might be provided with different recommendations and the opportunity to adopt positions themselves .
The voters in our Member States must be given a guarantee that free and fair referendums will be arranged everywhere so that , once the decisions – whether in favour or otherwise - have been made , everyone can say that things were done fairly .
We respect their decisions .     I am abstaining from voting on this report .
The Member States’ contributions should be reduced permanently with a view to limiting the way in which money is shunted around and , in the longer term , even the EU’s administration .
Moreover , it is a budgetary year in which reform of staffing and the reform of the financial management are making their mark on developments in all the EU institutions .
The provisional draft budget showed that there was no margin at all remaining .
The savings have hit what we call the other institutions particularly hard , and that is something at which we want to look in detail in Parliament .
Parliament’s budget has not been touched by the Council because of what is termed the gentleman’s agreement .
We each look after our own budget .
I think it is transparently obvious , however , that the Council’s administrative budget has increased at a rate of almost 5 % in relation to the budget for 2004 , in which the overall increase for all the institutions is one of 3 % .
Let us set that aside for the moment , however .
I can , moreover , only agree that some money can be saved through cooperation between the institutions on the personnel side and in connection with the languages .
I think that is something we must look at , and we must , of course , also check carefully that interinstitutional cooperation pays dividends .
The Council has thus accepted the desired positions on enlargement and on new tasks but has , in return , cut back the amounts by 5 % , as Mrs Schreyer pointed out .
I now also think that it is to take account of the fact that a number of the appointments are not progressing as quickly as expected .
Regarding Parliament’s budget for 2005 , I can point out that it is also influenced by enlargement and by the reforms of staffing policy and of financial management , and we should also have liked to have seen a number of improvements to MEPs’ conditions .
Parliament plans to conduct an information campaign concerning the draft Constitution , and account has been taken of this in the budget .
In common with all the other institutions , Parliament must ensure as cheap and efficient administration as possible but , as has emerged in the first round , Parliament’s budget will constitute 20 % of the administrative expenditure in 2005 .
Even a minor reduction in the rate of increase of the budget may be quite damaging to some of the small institutions , especially those that are at the development stage .
As part of a solution to the problem in expenditure area 5 , I think we should consider whether we might transfer unused funds in the administration budgets to 2005 and if we might make payments in advance , so introducing some room for manoeuvre into the administrative budgets in 2005 and thus creating a margin ; or , in other words , that we engage in what , in budgeting jargon , is called the frontloading of unused funds .
There are major problems in expenditure area 5 , but I do not think they are so great that the Council and Parliament should not together be able to find a reasonable solution .     Mr President , I cannot say congratulations to the Commissioner , but I have three questions .
Why do you not follow your predecessor , Mr Solbes , who thought that the Stability and Growth Pact was perfectly alright .
It is the Commission that is to administer and oversee these rules .
We also have Mr Zalm back in his seat as the Netherlands ’ representative , so that we might again hear his normally tough position on this issue , which I of course love .
So let us wait a little .
I should also like to ask the chairman of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , who has unfortunately left his seat , why someone does not get hold of Mr Schroeder and tell him that he should observe the rules ?
Mr Schroeder has the problem of not keeping to the Stability and Growth Pact , and flexible rules will not help him , so make sure now that he is made to follow the rules .
That is not something I ever thought would happen to me in an assembly with which I would otherwise have thought I was more or less in agreement .
A second , and probably just as important , question is one to the Commission as to why it has gone easy on the demand for the protection of freshwater turtles .
