Does the Minister agree that no matter how many years before Tibet regains its freedom , no European state should recognise the illegal actions by the Chinese Government in Tibet and that the transfer of tens of thousands of non-Tibetan people into Amdo is illegal under international law ?
The World Bank has now recognised this and I understand is abandoning its so-called Western Poverty Project proposal .
The British Government has not yet withdrawn its support and all I ask the President-in-Office to do is to remind all Member State governments on the Council - including Britain - that they must not endorse or be seen to endorse illegal acts and abuses of human rights and national rights against the people and the nation of Tibet .
The European Union has a lot more than just the ability to send investigative parties , have discussions , make recommendations and so forth .
In the case of Egypt , as has already been said , we have the European-Mediterranean programmes and association agreements .
In the case of China we have very many major trading arrangements and , potentially , their accession to the WTO .
Could we not use our power , our muscle , in order to achieve our human rights objectives and not just go on talking and talking without seeing any results ?
I would like to ask the President-in-Office , finally , if he and his Council recognise the outcome of democratic elections within this Union ?
Secondly , does he believe that the Portuguese presidency acted in haste as a result of a series of telephone calls throughout Europe when that decision was taken ?
Would it not have been wiser to summon a meeting of the heads of state for an important decision like this which - remember - will have consequences long after our time here in the European Parliament ?
I would like to hear the views of the Portuguese presidency , and maybe other presidencies , when others coming from the extreme right or indeed the extreme left enter government within the Union .
This should be a Europe of unity and solidarity .
To use a slang word it is a 'cop-out ' to say that it is not a matter for the Council .
Someone must take an initiative to resolve this serious problem .
It has given stature to an individual who does not deserve that stature .
In fact it has strengthened his position , not weakened it .
Mr President , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on this report .
It is an important area and she has rightly drawn attention to it .
It refers to the new powers of the Community over the last few years : rights of asylum , immigration and general cooperation in civil matters .
It is therefore crucial that we use these powers to improve the position of victims of crime .
At the time of the crime , especially personal , physical or violent crime , many victims , if not all , will be vulnerable , distressed , upset , probably angry , and desperately in need of support .
As the rapporteur has said , they do not need to become victims again .
Nor do they need to feel that they are being branded almost as criminals themselves .
We need to ensure - and this report goes a long way towards it - that the procedures do not negate the situation or make it worse , but rather , that they support and assist the victims .
The rapporteur has said that we also need to make certain that safeguards are in place so that there is no intrusion into the privacy of victims .
We must in particular draw attention to intrusion or possible intrusion by the press .
I am particularly pleased that this report includes support in the language or dialect of the victim of crime because sometimes that is an area that is overlooked .
Likewise the necessity for training of police officers and others in authority .
Ethnic minorities , very often women , children - those who sometimes find the system difficult - will be the ones who are most at risk in this sort of situation .
Those who perhaps are in fear of authority are especially vulnerable .
The PSE Group is pleased to support this report and to congratulate the rapporteur .
However , there will be no surprise that we will reject those amendments that have been put down in the name of certain members of the TDI Group .
Those amendments do not improve the report ; rather they are a crude attempt to add the biased , distorted and racist sentiment of the signatories concerned .
I congratulate the rapporteur on her work .
I congratulate the Commission on bringing this forward , and I wish it every success in the future .
Mr President , on behalf of the Liberal Group , I should like to welcome this report and to thank Mrs SÃ¶rensen for her excellent work in drawing up such an important document .
I welcome the underlying Commission communication , but I would say , on behalf of my Group , that we regret that this communication was not much stronger .
It is quite clear that the Treaties provide the Union with the instruments that are necessary to strengthen protection of the victims of crime .
I think , for example , of some of the conclusions of the Wergens report , and we would have expected more from the Commission than proposals for greater dialogue and the exchange of best practice .
We need clear measures to help victims with access to assistance , justice and compensation .
However , it must be said that if we feel the Commission could do more , the
