important it is for the EU to adopt rules right now that indicate a more responsible , credible and long-term approach to these complex and very controversial issues .
It is an issue of great importance not only for us Europeans but also for the rest of the world , especially the developing countries .
I have proceeded on the basis that we in actual fact want to improve the environmental situation in the coastal states .
When we get together to take a measure within the maritime sphere , we can now , as Mr Lange also said , achieve a very great deal internationally .
We have been talking a very great deal about the new reduction methods , an area Mr Goodwill said I had been anxious about .
The overall effects need to be looked at .
Mr President , there is a fundamental requirement that should always be made of a constitution , irrespective of whether it is a national constitution or the constitution of the European Union .
The Swedish Parliament - the Riksdag - was given more or less unlimited power to take decisions on just about every issue on the basis of a simple majority .
Thanks to a unique Swedish tradition , freedom of expression and freedom of the press retained their strong position , but the political authorities were given the go-ahead to put their fingers into every pie .
There are proposals to make social issues with shared competence matters for the EU.
In the same way , all essential aspects of economic policy must remain the responsibility of the Member States .
Low taxes will be the new Member States ' only chance of gradually catching up economically with the current Member States .
It is also a unique opportunity for small Member States too to influence the work of the EU.
There is a political agreement between ourselves in Parliament , the Council of Ministers and the Commission whereby , through adoption , we can avoid conciliation .
The new Statute would not lead to increased openness unless , instead of the current system involving flat-rate payments , there were a system for the reimbursement of travel costs whereby it was the actual costs that were reimbursed .
In the future too , I should ideally like to see the salary level of Members of the European Parliament set in relation to the levels applicable in the national parliaments .
( SV ) I have not taken part in the vote because I find it absurd that we ourselves must decide on our salaries and other financial conditions .
The Bosphorus Bridge took me from the more ancient Istanbul to the more modern Üsküdar .
We should instead be delighted to take on board the interest shown by Turkey in becoming a member of the EU.
We should give the country the help it needs in order to reform itself and become a perfectly satisfactory future candidate country .
To try to set up religious obstacles to Turkish membership of the EU would be not only deeply unfortunate but also downright unchristian .
I wish sincerely to thank the Greek representative of the Council for his committed answer and for the work that is being done .
By doing this , it would also be encouraging the prime ministers and foreign ministers of the Member States in that way to emphasise the value of the Sakharov Prize .
I am , however , also a little concerned that it is often regarded as a sort of soft legislation and poor man 's alternative to ordinary legislation , or as something that should only be used in emergencies .
The open coordination method is a modern form of project administration .
That is something I find odd .
It would then be nothing like so effective .
It is about the fact that the open coordination method is also a cooperation , and not only a coordination , method .
What we need are best practices .
This method is quite different .
I should like to see this method promoted .
It is also more prevalent in the Anglo-Saxon countries .
That would be a mercy worth quietly asking for , since the Lisbon objectives appear more and more to be taking on the character of illusions .
I do not however share the view that this is something that should be decided or debated at EU level .
Why , though ?
The Moderate delegation will therefore vote against the report , for someone must take a different view .
The men wondered what was to happen now .
What is done through thoughtlessness and prejudice has the same effect , however .
Moreover , it is often men who call the shots in sport .
We have worked single-mindedly to create equal opportunities for girls and boys .
Sport is significant in many ways .
It is almost always beneficial and healthy for those who practise it .
The European Parliament cannot remove all the causes of the lack of equality in sport , any more than we can remove such causes in other areas of society .
Sponsors can exercise pressure on clubs .
Let us make use of that will to bring about equality in European sport .
I note that , unfortunately , the majority of the European Parliament deliberately put the draft Statute into a form that , for understandable reasons , can hardly be approved by the Council .
Parliament did not convince the surrounding world that it in actual fact wanted to help bring about a situation in which travel costs would in future be reimbursed on the basis of actual costs .
The fact is that we normally eat at least three times a day .
In the light of this , there is only one route to go down , and that is one of total openness in our systems .
