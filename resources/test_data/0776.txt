Subsequently , the aid figures will need to correlate with the absolute numbers .
In order to achieve this , they need to maintain their own social networks and they need activities which will strengthen their prospects in their country of origin upon their return and , of course , they need to be able to maintain their self-respect .
This week , for example , in the Dutch Lower Chamber - and undoubtedly elsewhere - an asylum policy is again being discussed which is drafted in such a way as to be completely out of tune with everything that is happening in the EU Member States .
This seems very bad policy on the part of the Netherlands .
I also want to congratulate the rapporteur , Mrs Frahm , on the handling of this important topic and I hope that she will accept my efforts in the field of tailor-made solutions for what they mean as regards , on the one hand , refugees and , on the other , displaced persons .
This is also evident today as we scrutinise the amendment to Directive 95/53 at second reading .
The Council made a few editorial changes , which were not a problem for us at the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .
After the citrus pulp scandal , the Member States themselves requested that the Commission should act .
It immediately drew lessons from the dioxin crisis .
What matters to the European People ' s Party is that the consumer has choices .
Finally , the Framework Directive also stipulates that facilitating the manufacture and preparation of foodstuffs is an acceptable criterion of usefulness .
We now have to make a decision : either we accept the opinions of the Scientific Committees in principle , or we do not ; but then these Scientific Committees will need to be reformed once again .
Mr President , the report is concerned with supplementing a list of permitted additives with additional foodstuff additives , other than colouring agents and flavourings .
The example of E401 or sodium alginate - a word which I can pronounce - has been mentioned .
During that meeting , agreement was reached , in principle , to adopt a compromise approach which was subsequently refined .
This has since been done and we are grateful for this .
Although the own resources are falling , they are still an important source of income and it has now been decided that certain Member States are allowed to retain 25 % .
Everyone wants to outstrip the others and agriculture would be able to take the wind out of the sails of the other budget components .
We are expecting a report on this .
We look forward to the findings because we would like to considerably reduce the number of court cases at the Court of Justice in Luxembourg .
Or does it intend to ?
We have translated this criticism into a number of very concrete questions , answers and proposals in order to make drastic changes to the policy as it is being adopted now and will be adopted this coming year .
Very often , economic interests of the various Member States in Europe take priority over poverty issues in the relevant countries .
I would like to underline the confidence we have in the Commission and all its Commissioners .
In our opinion , an explanation should reflect the resolution itself and should not include any new elements .
We must not get ahead of ourselves .
This is an extremely political issue .
The following general rule will need to apply to this Commission : the error rate is too high .
Mr President , before I comment on Mrs Stauner ' s report , I would like to endorse what has been said before , namely that the European Parliament is quite right to rap the European Commission over the knuckles and to at least postpone the discharge on the 1998 budget .
In my own country , for example , I know of projects which have been launched with so-called European money which would never have been accepted or requested by the people , if it they had known that their own tax money would be used for them .
National states support all kinds of Third Way movements , so does Europe .
This is borne out by the far-reaching reforms which the Commission has now undertaken .
The Kuhne report is Parliament ' s first report which takes discharge seriously .
This is why it is not enough to measure up against the non-elected officials within the Commission .
We must think very hard about this so that we can actually restore the citizen' s confidence .
I am in favour of this approach and as such , would like to ask you to adopt Mrs Stauner ' s report without any further ado .
The complaints are staggering and include a faulty inventory and many thefts .
Mr Kuhne has hit out in the press and also here today at the stance taken by my Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance .
I am now counting on a majority in the plenary meeting .
I cannot help thinking that many administrative expenses are intentionally estimated on the generous side in order to have the extra funding for buildings in reserve .
Is it not about time we commissioned an independent inquiry into the decision-making process for building projects ?
Needless to say , Parliament needs to keep a critical eye on the Commission .
In countless cases , no action was taken or if it was , it did not lead to any result .
He did not let himself be talked into adjusting his well-balanced approach in the face of sometimes heated publications .
Only when Parliament has its own financial housekeeping in order
