Usually , we do not get much further than elegant allusions .
If they are pursuing a viable Palestinian state , law and order must first be restored on the West Bank .
That is why we have been looking for a modest instrument with which the EU can implement policy in developing countries that does not , strictly speaking , fall within the scope of fighting poverty .
Neither is it taken out of the foreign policy kitty .
Perhaps I am concerned because I am a journalist .
If I cannot reach agreement with the PPE-DE Group before we vote tomorrow at noon - which will be a pity - I shall ask for a referral back to my committee .
Without taking anything away from her divine status , I would urge you not to be distracted by this and to vote emphatically in favour of the legislative resolution during the roll-call vote at the end .
He took the view that tax policy was not intended for this purpose .
This can only create confusion .
Both this democratically elected Parliament and the European Commission see the necessity to cover some modest forms of cooperation between the EU and developing countries , actions that are not strictly speaking poverty alleviation , such as exchange programmes between universities here and there .
It is not restricted to size .
However , if I hear this type of reaction from the Commission , I will seriously reconsider and suggest to my group that we reconsider whether we can support the SPE product .
Perhaps you should make some phone calls tonight to Mr McCreevy and Mr Å pidla and see whether tomorrow you can present a better proposal on this before the vote .
Key definitions are framed differently in different countries and the number of Member States that have independent public oversight is a long way short of 27 .
The European Union has been tackling this kind of environmental pollution for decades , and recently all the attention in the environmental field has been focused on CO2 and climate change .
I have tabled a couple of supplementary amendments , therefore .
The report we shall be adopting today welcomes the establishment of a European asylum agency but regrets the slow progress on implementing the second phase ; for which , of course , the non-entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon is to blame .
No satisfactory answers are provided to such questions .
I have therefore chosen to wholeheartedly endorse the Schaldemose report .
The existing rules are improved and supplemented by two reports , one by Mr Savary and one by Mr Fernandes .
The authority needs to have expertise , be competent to take independent decisions and be permanent in nature .
I should like to express my warm thanks to him posthumously .
The aim is to have high-quality authorities - for the accommodation of ships in distress , for example - in all Member States .
The truth is , of course , that we do not mean to impose anything at all ; on the contrary , we wish to offer a wide range of possibilities to help Member States who so desire to introduce , in their own time , the 'polluter pays ' principle into the road transport sector .
I should also like to thank everyone involved .
Such revenue must be reinvested in the transport system with the aim of keeping external costs down .
Consequently , I wish to propose to my fellow Members that we stick with the package supported by the Committee on Transport and Tourism .
We are staunch supporters of investment in sustainable transport .
I also agree with Mrs Wortmann-Kool when she says that here , too , we must pay particular attention to the internal market .
Therefore , we agree to the inclusion of air pollution , noise and congestion in the internalisation of external costs .
These developments have a negative impact on the environment , and their costs are not borne by hauliers .
A discussion on road pricing - taxing road traffic according to the distance travelled - has been under way there for nearly 20 years , and has now become completely deadlocked .
It is good that Member States are to be given the opportunity to pass on external costs to the polluter .
Lorries are not the only road users responsible for congestion costs ; other modes of transport generate them too .
The Commission must take very seriously its tasks under Article 11( 1 ) .
If you add all this up , you arrive at an absolute maximum of 82 euro cents for the few kilometres where there is congestion .
For the rest of the route , the 65 euro cents can be deducted .
I can assure you that I shall do my best as rapporteur to secure most , if not all , of Parliament 's position , which we shall then discuss at a later date .
If we could use the proceeds from this levy to invest in transport by rail or water , we would address both the traffic jam problem and climate change .
Ultimately , this is a choice between the devil and the deep-blue sea .
I support this report because it suggests ways in which we can improve the situation of the Roma community .
This is why the Verts/ALE Group is opposed to promoting a ' European recovery plan ' in the light of the imminent European Spring Summit , whose only mission is to stimulate the old laissez-faire model back into life .
Indeed , we do not agree with the implications of this amendment , and together with my group colleagues , I voted emphatically against it .
Political reform and meeting the Copenhagen criteria are absolute priorities .
When I , along
