.
I also agree that the owner of a trademark should , in certain circumstances , have the right to register their trademarked product with a PDO or a PGI.
Furthermore , this is an important instrument from which Portuguese shipowners also benefit - as well as Spanish , French , Italian , Greek and Irish shipowners - and it is therefore regrettable that the Commission has not respected the allocation key contained in the previous agreement and has penalised Portugal by 20 tonnes .
Our focus must be on implementing measures rather than on drafting guidelines .
Consequently , no guarantees have been made to establish conditions that will ensure that priority is given to employment , to economic and social cohesion and to combating social exclusion , a crucial issue in the fight against the dominance of neo-liberal policies in the European Union .
Current problems in this area may in future be greatly reduced or even avoided altogether through the action employers are expected to take to assess and improve the noise levels to which workers are exposed .
I welcome the preparation of a code of conduct that provides practical guidelines aimed at helping workers and employers in the music and entertainment sectors to fulfil their legal obligations as set out in this directive .
This measure makes very good sense for two main reasons : First , since the opportunities open to fishermen in these regions have shrunk , it is vital to expand them by increasing the exclusive fishing area to 50 miles .
( PT ) The Commission seems to envisage a common fisheries policy that focuses more on the short-term interests of the Member States than on the interests of the fishermen .
At the same time , I welcome the proposal for regional advisory councils , which will allow the involvement of interested and affected actors , although I think that decision-making powers should remain as they are now .
I consider that addressing the shortage of fish stocks is not just a question of scrapping vessels .
I am in favour of tighter control with dissuasive penalties , namely the loss of public aid for fleet renewal , against those Member States that do not comply with the reduction in capacity laid down in the multiannual guidance programme .
This would cause enormous damage - as well as penalising the States that have complied most - and would have unforeseeable effects that would jeopardise the survival of an entire social group and an indispensable way of life , especially in heavily dependent regions with marked seafaring and fishing traditions .
No study , analysis or report has been presented , either , on the social and economic impact that will result from the drastic changes to the structural fisheries policy that the Commission wants to introduce .
I broadly welcome the positive work done by the rapporteur , and the way I voted reflects my complete solidarity with the Portuguese positions on this subject .
We voted against this resolution in order to reaffirm our complete disagreement with the creation of a monthly 'parliamentary allowance ' , the same for all Members regardless of the States they represent , because we believe that MEPs ' salaries should be based on the salaries of the members of the national parliaments in the countries where they were elected , where social realities differ .
It is crucial that we stop the problem of illegal immigration at source and take effective action against individuals involved in the trafficking of human beings ( the third most lucrative activity for organised crime ) and the economic exploitation of migrants .
They should be given the opportunity to start a new life , with access to suitable housing , medical and psychological care , and access to the job market , education and training .
While supporting the idea of providing assistance to the victims of the trafficking in immigrants , we cannot accept the way in which the Commission tries to do this , since it treats victims of trafficking in human beings for the purpose of prostitution in the same way as it treats illegal immigrants who seek work in the European Union and only turn to illegality because of the unacceptable positions upheld by the Community institutions , which try to turn the European Union into a 'fortress Europe ' instead of increasing support for cooperation with their countries of origin and supporting their integration .
In addition , the establishment of this special measure is conditional upon real cooperation of the victim with the national authorities , with a view to dismantling illegal immigration networks .
The resolution passed today supports a European Commission programme for 2003 that restates the basic lines of the current policies carried out at European Union level , which are essentially characterised as neoliberal , federalist and militarist .
And nor can the small States be held responsible for the absence of a Social Europe , the small size of the budget , the lack of reform of the CAP , the crisis in structural policy or the limitations of the judicial instruments of the area of freedom , security and justice .
Having made a thorough study of the Spanish initiatives , we have reached the conclusion that , although we are unable to subscribe to them fully , they can be accepted if some amendments are made to them that are basically designed to ensure that guarantees of the protection of citizens ' rights are not called into question , thereby responding to the European Parliament 's main concern throughout this process .
A legal basis must also be provided for the operation of the Sirene offices , an idea that I had already suggested in my report of June 2001 , and which forces these offices to remove data whenever this proves necessary .
I hope that the European Parliament will then have
