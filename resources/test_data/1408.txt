a position on our approach to the matter of people ' s health , although we might not see a direct connection , for instance , with leukaemia .
It is very possible that other harmful effects , for example in connection with drinking water , will be evident in the long term .
However , the EU will have no human rights strategy whilst the responsibility continues to remain primarily with the Member States .
To some extent that is inevitable .
For that reason the opportunity we now have well beforehand to discuss the Council ' s priorities in the forthcoming meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Commission is a welcome one .
Human rights violations must be taken seriously at all times and not just when a political excuse is needed .
This is a tendency that can also be discerned in our approach to the questions on the Human Rights Commission ' s agenda , regionally , nationally and with regard to the issues themselves .
For the EU' s voice to carry further and more audibly it must have a consistent policy , one that is genuinely its own , and must firm up its work in this area .
That means long-term , systematic involvement in human rights work when it is not directly connected with benefits to be gained or current events covered by the media .
They can also bring a breath of fresh air to that vacuum in which we busy about far too much with matters of only rather narrow , topical interest .
We have recently had perhaps the most confused Summit the EU has ever seen .
The programme of the Swedish Presidency is full-bodied and ambitious , and it really is time environmental issues in their broadest context were finally taken to the core of any debate in the European Union .
But I am nevertheless slightly worried , and I will now address my words to the Commission , about the timetable for drafting the subjects for debate , for example , for the Gothenburg Summit .
And I would once more like to address a question to the Commission , which is how adequate resources - staffing resources , for example - can be guaranteed so that this northern dimension policy also receives the go-ahead for an extension from the Commission .
This Chamber reacts with sensitivity to all the events taking place around the world , but we do not give sufficient attention to the Grim Reaper at work on the roads of Europe .
This should be a cause for panic .
Four times as many people die in road accidents in Portugal than in Britain .
A car in a garage is completely harmless , but when it is being used wrongly it is like a deadly weapon .
Traffic regulations are not cookery book recipes that everyone can adapt to their own taste .
I will mention three important ways of reducing the number of road fatalities .
And it is no wonder , because only very rarely do I see any speed controls in operation .
Around two out of every three drivers in Europe go over the speed limit in built-up areas and half break the speed limit on the open road .
Certainly in my country , Finland , the EUR 100 000 fines paid by some amount to just routine fare collections .
Secondly , in vino veritas : there is truth in wine .
I think it is important that Member States switch to an alcohol limit of 0.5 per mil , which can also be monitored .
In repeated cases of drunken driving , or when the driver is well over the limit , there should be a long ban and the car should be confiscated by the state .
My country is a sad example of this .
In general , taxation should focus on a car ' s use and not its purchase price .
Ladies and gentlemen , I wish you a safe trip .
At present intermodality is expensive owing to friction costs , inefficiency , frameworks of infrastructure , and partly also because road transport tends to be favoured .
I would also like to point out that this form of transport is the most efficient system for long journeys .
Mr President , Commissioner , I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Costa , for his most excellent work .
I think it is important that the issue is now being dealt with by Parliament .
The importance of charging for the use of the transport infrastructure will increase as a means of controlling the situation in the future .
There are still a lot of problems attached to a system of charges .
Long distances , scattered populations and difficult natural conditions must be taken account of when the instruments in respect of charges are determined , just as the report states .
In my opinion , it is important that we look into the possible impact of the scheme before charging becomes a reality .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank the rapporteur for his resolute approach to the work he has done , which is so typical of him , on this report , which is a broad portrayal of human life in growing forest stock country .
When we calculate the amount of carbon that is sequestered in forests I think we also have to take into account the stands of forest stock that were grown and tended prior to 1990 .
They who have tended their forests properly for decades , lived off forestry and know this delicate balance , would be penalised , because there are Member States in which people no longer have anywhere to plant a tree , unless they start planting them on their own roofs
