the implications of membership of the euro area , which we think is both a right and a duty .
Today , then , to these European nations , where the right wing have not ceased to defend national freedoms at a time when almost every other political persuasion put up with their enslavement , we are tempted to shout a warning , " Do not enter this house which is already suffocating us .
This is more than a question ; it is a real challenge , and it is up to us to accept it .
The accession of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe , Cyprus and Malta , provides us with a historic opportunity to unite all the nations of Europe on the basis of shared ideals , and to make the whole continent a more stable place .
Try as I might , ladies and gentlemen , I cannot understand the Group of the European People ' s Party which , despite the successive crises , involving Belgian chickens contaminated by dioxins , French sewage sludge in animal feed or Dutch sump oils in cooking oil , wishes to continue to poison European consumers to some extent .
A slot must therefore be provided , at least at the end of the process , for the Commission to inform Parliament of the decisions that it has taken .
This would , to my mind , be an appalling message to send to consumers and producers .
I therefore think that , given the prevailing attitude in the House , we can face the vote with confidence and hope to achieve a majority , which will enable us to put our point of view across at second reading .
Today , this idea of bringing everything into line , which is completely cut off from reality , is leading some people to call for spot checks , with no warning to the States in which Brussels has no confidence .
This is , of course , all due to the BSE tragedy that turned into a real saga , with several episodes .
These three conditions are firstly that the Commission makes a success of its own pre-accession strategy , particularly in the areas of regional policy , agricultural policy and environmental policy .
I voted against the Brok report on the enlargement of the European Union , because whilst it may be very clear-sighted in technical terms , it is nevertheless prompted by mistaken political ideas about the future of Europe .
Furthermore , this is the type of problem that was taken into account in 1992 , in Protocol No 1 of the Maastricht Treaty , in order to grant an exemption allowing the Danes to maintain their restrictions on the purchase of second homes by non-residents .
The report we have been debating today seeks to provide an update on the progress that has been made in accession negotiations with all the candidate countries .
Enlargement with the addition of thirteen countries changes not only the geopolitical framework of the European Union , but also its structure , because the total population will increase ( by 28 % ) , but so will the number of 'disadvantaged ' regions .
Nevertheless , in order to prevent Europe becoming nothing more than a free trade area , the European Union must provide clear answers to the institutional , social and economic questions that enlargement is bound to raise .
The rapporteur is furthermore forced to acknowledge that " the changes taking place in the candidate countries have led to social problems and in particular to marked social stratification and in some cases high unemployment . "
That particular plan is one that the public rejects .
We are warning them , as friends .
I look forward to early Estonian membership .
Moreover , Poland fully respects human rights and fundamental freedoms .
I welcome the Gawronski report on Poland 's application for membership of the European Union and share the majority of conclusions that he draws .
In welcoming Poland to our common home , the European Union will be doing justice to a newcomer , justice that has been denied to it for far too long .
I welcome the Queir√≥ report on Hungary 's application for membership of the European Union and share the majority of conclusions that he draws .

To date , 16 out of 31 chapters have been closed and the efforts of the Republic of Cyprus to meet all the criteria are ongoing .

Mr President , what remains to be said on the subject of food safety and the precautions to be taken in order to avoid further instances of contamination or further food crises ?
We are particularly keen to implement in a practical manner at European level this concept of food safety from the stable to the table , or from the pitchfork to the fork .
We have voted against the joint resolution based on a recital which , behind its hypocritical wording , suggests that relations between Asia and Europe are conducted between equal partners .
We therefore have no choice but to vote against the joint resolution .
We are thereby boosting the positions of the European Union regarding the practical situations experienced by European nationals in connection with discrimination and equal treatment .
I shall therefore confine my remarks to the limitations which , I feel , still remain in spite of everything .
So New Caledonia operates a preference based on skin colour .
They are going to give the anti-racist associations and the trade unions greater control regarding instances of discrimination , but I feel that now it is going to be necessary to make application of these directives , and compliance with labour law , mandatory by stepping up the number of inspections and by penalising offending employers .
