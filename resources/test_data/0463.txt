An ΕU which is in the process of militarisation , which cooperates with the USA and ΝΑΤΟ against the people has no right to refer to codes of conduct on arms exports and disarming .
The demagogic pronouncements of the ΕU , that the sending of the expeditionary force to Bosnia-Herzegovina will allegedly help democracy move forward , is an insult to the Balkan people , who have paid for the imperialist armed interventions in the area with blood and misery .
They confine themselves solely to renewable energy sources , to the strengthening of energy performance and to the production of energy from biomass , without including other measures such as using biofuels as partial substitutes for mineral fuels , making greater use of the heat generated in electricity stations , improving the techniques available for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases per produced energy unit and providing essential protection for and developing forests to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere .
They do not constitute a change of policy .
They have nothing to say in the face of the despicable statements by Mrs Palacio .
The defence of Cuba is the people 's affair .
It is the duty of every progressive person to support the ideals of independence , freedom and socialism , which are the response to imperialist barbarity .     . –The summit on 4-5 November took decisions of strategic importance for the faster promotion of the anti-grass roots and repressive policy which will unhesitatingly hit the mass grass-roots movement and the workers of Europe over the next five years .
With immigration policy and the prevention and combating of terrorism as a pretext , they are introducing biometric details , they are strengthening central data exchange facilities , they are laying down a strategy for managing crises within the EU which affect vital infrastructure and public order and security in the EU , or so they maintain .
The new Commission reminds me therefore of the Greek proverb , ' Manolios changed and wore his hat the other way round ' .
For months you have been advertising yourself as independent .
However , we still have concerns about important issues and we are calling for clear guarantees and commitments from Mr Barroso 's Commission .
We are calling for the strengthening of the agreement on institutional relations with the European Parliament and , above all , Mr Barroso , we are calling for you to focus on sustainable development , employment , solidarity and cohesion and to strengthen the role of Europe as a force for peace and cooperation when you present your Commission 's programme statements .
You said at the time that you would pay great attention to the views of the members of the European Parliament , even if they opposed your own .
We believe that the new composition which you have presented is more efficient and will respond to the issues of prosperity , solidarity and security .
Mr Barroso , we wish you broad support for your new Commission and every success in your difficult job .     – Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , the European Parliament called in its motion , following these incidents , for all the necessary measures to be taken so that the people responsible for these murders and for the shooting of unarmed demonstrators would be brought to justice .
We need to take account of the information given and to call for the lack of open character and absence of transparency in the operation of the European institutions to be addressed .
One might , however , say that , even if we take account of the 40 % increase in the number of complaints which Mr Diamandouros announced in 2004 , few of the 425 million European citizens took recourse to the European Ombudsman , an institution which has already been up and running for ten years and which has been served with acknowledged success and strengthened by the presence of both the first Ombudsman , Mr Söderman , and his current successor , Nikiforos Diamandouros .
Finally , I would emphasise that it is to the credit of the European Ombudsman that he is conducting five own initiative investigations , the most exemplary being into the abolition of discrimination against the disabled on the part of European institutions .
In particular young people , women and socially excluded groups of citizens in general ascribe the disdain which they experience on a daily basis to the policy of the European Union .
However , what is needed in order for the institutions to function better and be considered worthy , apart from the personalities which represent them , is for them to be strengthened .
We often speak of the democratic deficit , of the lack of transparency or political will in a way which automatically forces my generation to classify them using political .
If we support both , perhaps at the next elections we shall be surprised , this time pleasantly .
Personally , I am convinced .
The statements by the new Commissioners designate confirm our estimation that they will serve the interests of big business with passion .
It is the obligation of the European Union to remain constant on questions of principle and not to take a selective approach , as certain parties have hastened to do .
It would certainly be a strategic error if the European Union were to be trapped in the dilemma between Europe and Russia .
The undisguised intervention of the ΕU , with the presence of Mr Solana and the governments of Poland and Latvia , suppresses any concept of national independence and is connected to efforts by the ΕU to safeguard a beneficial playing ground for controlling the region in the tug of war between USA and Russia .
It is in the interest of the Ukrainian people , who alone have the authority to resolve their problems
