Secondly , the Erika I and Erika II packages must be implemented straight away .
Firstly , we know very well , the shipowners , who have ships in bad condition .
Ladies and gentlemen , we must distinguish between two types of flag of convenience : fiscal and financial convenience and the convenience of those States which give their flags to wrecks , to ecological time-bombs , to ships which under no circumstances deserve to sail the seas .
Therefore we have to speak not only to Russia , but to all the countries of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea , that is , the Mediterranean in the broadest sense .
Of course , the Commission , by means of the Agency and the reports we will present here , will specifically monitor true compliance by the Member States with the issues agreed .
They take place when the sea is rough , with winds of more than 100 kilometres per hour , in situations where ships have problems with manoeuvrability , with waves of 8 or 10 metres as in the case of the Prestige or the Erika .
Well I will tell you : a reprogramming of EUR 10 million , of the Objective 2 funds , which Brittany benefited from .
We will have to see what solutions are possible and we will also have to see how Europe can show solidarity , and I sure there will be no lack of it .
I really do not understand Mr Galeote .
In no way have I tried to call Mr Galeote a thief .
What I am saying is that you cannot say in Spain that we are going together to ask for more funds and then say here that the funds should not be given because the Spanish Government is at fault .
But we have not made much progress on that either .
Of course , this global approximation must include a repressive aspect , but in order to ensure the fulfilment of an immigration policy , in order to control illegal employment - if Berlusconi will allow me - in order to establish a policy for integration of external trade .
The European Councils in Tampere , Laeken and Seville have represented a significant advance in the field of immigration .
This is a task which , in order to be successful , must be carried out in close cooperation with the third countries bordering the European Union .
Mr President , the will of the Commission in response to the orientations of the European Council to establish a global and integrated policy of migrations is very laudable , but the police and Interior Ministry approach , which can be gathered from the communication , clashes directly with this Parliament 's view of the relations the European Union must maintain with the developing countries , whose immigrants , by the way - and according to the Commission itself - are not a problem from a quantitative point of view .
In this way , the Commission would be acting coherently with itself , since it states , in the communication we are debating today , that it is aware that the European Union 's relations with the developing countries must be based on solidarity .
Therefore , reception and integration must be considered as an essential part of the general immigration policy and this means agreed action , not only on the part of the European Union , but also on the part of national and regional governments , civil society and the immigrants themselves .
On 28 October , the Council of State of the French Republic approved a resolution declaring illegal the integration into the French public network of Diwan schools , which teach the Breton language , another autochthonous European language , like Basque , Catalan and also Alsatian , which originates from this very city of Strasbourg .
Specifically , does the Council have any type of mechanism for informing the Turkish Government of these cases , in order to prevent any repetition of these incidents , and in order to demonstrate to them in a practical way what the democratic functioning of the European institutions consists of ?
The financial framework decided in Berlin is clearly insufficient to deal with the costs of enlargement and the greater economic and social cohesion needs .
We must also take advantage of the possible impact of 2004 to demonstrate that it is entirely compatible to work for sport in the 15 Member States - or 25 , when enlargement takes place - and also at Community level , at the same time , and that they must not fear that we are going to take over their competences .
The political measures implemented are being analysed but their consequences are not being assessed .
With regard to programmes funded with Structural Funds , it has been noted that the objective of equality has not been met , including in the Regulation referring to them .
In recent days , in my region , Galicia , this equality is being clearly demonstrated , through solidarity and also through pain .
Last Tuesday , the plenum of the Spanish Congress of Deputies approved the idea that all legislative provisions produced by the government should include a report analysing their impact on gender equality .
Amongst all of us , men and women , we must make it possible for both governments of the current countries of the Union and the governments of the candidate countries to take equality seriously , to transpose the directives when necessary and ensure that they do not fail to comply with Community legislation .
One does not choose to be born a woman .
Now that the time has come to evaluate the work of the year , we can all be pleased .
Mr President , I would like to point out that the dialogue
