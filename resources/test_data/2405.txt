The Liberal Party is opposed to the export of live animals and has voted against budget line 05 02 13 04 .
Mr Bonde’s proposal cannot , however , be implemented in practice and must be considered unrealistic and ill thought-out .     The Members of the European Parliament from Denmark’s Liberal Party voted against Amendment 4 , tabled by Mr Bonde on behalf of the Independence and Democracy Group .
Mr Bonde’s proposal is , however , absurd and could not be implemented in practice .     Mr President , thank you very much .
The greatest challenge we face in our common future is that of how we in Europe can help make globalisation a real opportunity for social progress in the developing countries .
I told those to whom I was talking in China that I too was very concerned .
I am concerned if we cannot stand united in the world in order to fight for social justice and social progress in the developing countries .
It is therefore crucial to strengthen basic workers ’ rights , as agreed by the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalisation .
I have focused on three main issues in my speech .
Firstly , we cannot promote greater flexibility without providing our workers and children and women with greater social protection in exchange .
Secondly , Europe must not compete in terms of social dumping .
Nor should Europe export social dumping .
That is something I also know we agree with Mr Christensen about .
I should like to begin by saying thank you to the rapporteur , Mr Brejc , for his work on the report on the social dimension of globalisation and for cooperating with us so constructively in this connection .
It is just that the advantages are not distributed equally across all countries and all groups in society .
I am therefore pleased that the report focuses on , and gives rise to a debate about , the social aspect of globalisation .
We must ensure that the people of Europe do not associate globalisation only with companies transferring their operations abroad , dreadful conditions of work and mass redundancies .
Globalisation must , on the contrary , be associated with more and better jobs , more opportunities and increased prosperity for all .
We must do away with the harmful consequences of globalisation and ensure that the positive aspects of globalisation are more evenly distributed .
It must ensure that it creates good conditions for people in the EU so that they can cope successfully with international competition .
It must also invest in people .
Lifelong learning and the development of people’s skills are necessary if everyone is to be able to give a good account of themselves in the face of global competition .
Close cooperation between the two sides of industry can facilitate restructuring , just as increased information can reduce the fear of globalisation .
It is not only in the EU that globalisation must benefit people .
I should also like to thank the Court of Auditors for a constructive annual report .
One of the areas in which the EU has the biggest image problem of all is specifically in relation to the issue of how the Community’s money is managed .
We know from numerous opinion polls that Europe’s populations do not have a particularly high degree of confidence that their money – that is , the money they pay in taxes – is properly managed .
I wish to thank the Court of Auditors for an annual report that helps us MEPs fulfil two objectives : firstly , that of eradicating the misunderstandings and , secondly , that of coming up with good advice and helping solve those problems that do in actual fact exist , for problems there undoubtedly are .
It will become apparent that all these stories are based on myths and misunderstandings and that matters are not as bad as the frequent horror stories would suggest .
That is obviously a good thing .
That being said , it must naturally be emphasised that the mere fact that improvements are taking place in certain areas does not of course mean that we can live with the overall picture .
I agree with the previous speaker , Mr Pomés Ruiz , who said that it is scandalous .
The first task was to explode myths .
The second task is , of course , more important , for it consists of finding out how we are to solve these problems .
I quite agree , moreover , that , on this subject , a clear picture emerges .
The Member States are simply not complying with their responsibilities and are not doing enough .
Over the next few months , we must debate the annual report in more detail and implement the discharge procedure .
We want to tackle fewer subjects and , in return , do better-quality work .
In that way , voters would have nothing to lose but everything to gain , and we should have the right of codecision instead of being powerless .
Monitoring on the basis of the principle of proximity should begin in Parliament’s specialist committees , so that the social committees deal with proposals in the social sphere and the transport committees with transport proposals etc . – a procedure adopted in Denmark’s European Affairs Committee last Friday .
The annual programme should then be respected by , and debated in , the European Parliament and the Council .
Only then shall the Commission be invited to prepare legislation , which would then have support from the bottom up .
This would contrast with the present situation in which the Commission itself assumes the power and uses its monopoly on initiatives , its 3 000 secret working parties and its access to the Court of Justice to centralise ever more power in Brussels .
Centralisation has fortunately led the voters
