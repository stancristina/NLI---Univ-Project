I am happy to comply with paragraph 5 of your resolution to the extent that we can always update the Action Plan when the Member States supply us with information on the socio-economic impacts for any future stock recovery plan or multiannual management plan .
Perhaps this was not translated quite correctly .
And there is one thing that we want above all : the preamble refers to our Greek and Roman heritage and to the Enlightenment , but we must insist that our Christian heritage is also referred to in the preamble of the European constitution , forming as it does part of our identity today .
We need to keep open the option that one day , if we can reach that point , the President of the European Commission can also be the President of the European Council .
This weekend , this Saturday and Sunday , we are encouraging our Polish partners to vote ' Yes ' to Europe in their referendum , to say ' Yes ' to membership of the European Union .
It will place great demands on their citizens .
The pre-accession aid has not been fully used , and I regret that the Commissioner mentioned a figure of EUR 200 million .
Growth in the Balkans is too weak for them to catch up .
I agree with those fellow Members who have said that this is not about being particularly benevolent .
This applies in particular to those accession countries where referendums are still to be held and where there is a very definite scepticism about a European superstructure .
We as the European Union should not be left without a voice , as happened on Iraq .
As a consequence this House needs to adopt an opinion on this important subject at the very least next week and beyond that , because careful consideration is needed as to whether with its present organisation the European Union is in a position to take on such a role .
We are not voting on whether we want the reform or not , as some newspapers have suggested .
This compromise document is accompanied by two statements .
I myself have never had any problems , for example , with the fact that our Italian colleagues have more money than we do .
It is time we finally stripped nuclear energy of its privileges .
Thirdly , a revised Accession Partnership for Turkey was adopted on 14 April .
In the area of trade , we are proposing to give goods from the northern part of Cyprus access to the European Union .
Now there are some people who tend to emphasise the open door , while others stress the arduous path .
I know , too , that Commissioner Verheugen has often been criticised in Turkey for his tough but clear words .
The many amendments have clearly improved the report .
The report rightly condemns the banning of HADEP and the threat of court action to ban DEHAP.
Let us hope that the report will contribute to changing the policy of the Turkish Government in such a way that enables Turkey to accede to the European Union .
It is a long list , and one that Turkey must work through .
Let us tell Turkey straight , and we can dispense with this performance !
It notes that the conditions for opening accession negotiations have not yet been met at the present time , and calls upon the Council to take a clear and consistent position at last .
I wanted to ask you what the role of the southern Caucasus is in terms of cooperation with the Black Sea states ?
Madam President , I would just like to speak about the part for which Mrs Diamantopoulou is not responsible , namely culture , youth , education , media and sport .
Although we now know that the Convention , which has little to say about coordination , declared its opposition to the open variety of it , we also know that all national presidents should coordinate with each other , where the need arises , even in instances not necessarily covered by the Treaty .
'Of course ' , the citizens said , 'not just out of respect for you as a Member of Parliament , and not only as a right that a Member of Parliament must assert for herself and on behalf of the population : we demand democratic legitimisation of this wonderful opportunity ! '
Best practice should be disseminated , and quantitative and qualitative indicators laid down ; European directives should be implemented in national and regional policy , while of course observing the principle of subsidiarity , and put into practice in national action plans .
I also know , however , that coordination in various areas is already possible , definitely necessary and perfectly sensible .
The opinion of our committee is that it is not enough to say thank you to employees for their modesty and understanding ; instead , on the basis of voluntary schemes , they should have a share in the profits and investments that would not have been possible without their restraint .
The new enterprise law must ensure that employees are no longer outsiders , but members of the enterprise .
We also agree with Mr Menrad that the primary task is not harmonisation but better coordination , more information and - as part of a directive , of course - a voluntary approach .
It has a psychological effect .
Women 's participation in sport has steadily increased since then , even though it could and should develop more quickly today .
The individual Member States may , if they wish , draw up their own national lists of major sporting events which attract major public interest .
As I am sure you know , at that time the Group of
