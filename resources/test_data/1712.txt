Articles 4 and 5 of the Television without Frontiers Directive on the future of European policy in the audiovisual sector , positive steps have been made , there is nonetheless still concern about broadcasting quotas for European programmes , which remain low , making competition with other productions , especially from the United States , difficult to impossible .
Cultural diversity is impossible without television without frontiers , without a single market and protection of the human dignity of consumers , minors and citizens in general .
We cannot do a thing .
We import lemons from Chile , garlic from Tunisia , hazelnuts from Turkey and clothes from China .
Europe is getting poor .
We are budgeting for nations , not for computers ; we are not budgeting for numbers .
At the same time , the Council of Ministers of Agriculture has made an unexplained linear cut in spending of a further EUR 150 million .
That has already been reduced under the Council proposals and has already been reduced by the financial perspectives .
It was a comprehensive reply .
I would just like to point out that the European Commission is obliged under the Treaty to defend the .
It was a truly surprising interview .
All these policies , like enlargement , were decided at the summit , not by the Commission .
Which does it say ‘yes ’ to and which does it say ‘no’ to ?
There have been occasions in the past when you have proceeded in the opposite direction .     – Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on the fulsomeness of her work and my honourable friends for their speeches on the proposal for a recommendation by the European Parliament and the Council on the protection of minors and human dignity and the right of reply in relation to the competitiveness of the European audiovisual and information services industry being proposed through the De Sarnez report .
However , technology often also has negative results when it is used for the wrong purposes , especially when there is no proper legislative framework to regulate its use .
It proposes innovative and specific measures to control Internet sites with illegal and harmful content .
Finally , as far as the right of reply is concerned , there need to be common principles in all the Member States so that the protection of people 's dignity , honour and reputation can be safeguarded effectively .
It is important in my opinion – and I happen to be a doctor – that the six-month extension to which producers of medicinal products for paediatric use are entitled should be reduced , given that their products are already protected by pharmaceutical patents .
I want to ask Mrs Behrendt if she has asked a mother or father who have children and who do not have the money to buy the medicinal product .
Amendment 75 aims to clarify this and I call on you to vote for it .
Special attention needs to be given to the question of the production , testing and marketing of medicinal products , mainly due to the obvious need for greater transparency , given that direct and indirect financial interests attach to the production and marketing of these products and a whole set of medical practices and actions depend , either at research level or at application level , on their use .
There are no scales for weighing the health of children against financial interests .     – Mr President , Minister , I know from our numerous discussions that you are highly sensitive to the question of protection for citizens ' fundamental rights and personal data .
All this is important when it comes to examining proposals to keep records of European citizens ' electronic communications .
Today you demonstrated to us that access to these data is extremely useful in all instances .
I would be obliged if you could do so .
We must assure citizens that records of their telecommunications which are kept for long periods of time will be absolutely safe , not only against abuse by the state , but also – and I would emphasise this – by private individuals .
Withdraw it and let us all work together on the forthcoming initiative by the Commission and Mr Frattini .
In other words ,you foresee that in future these measures will not be necessary at all .
As far as minors are concerned , industry is typically left unaccountable while additional incentives are proposed for the use , for example , of special filters for violent , racist and pornographic images .
It is for these reasons that the parliamentary group of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the relevant texts .     . – Mr President , we have all borne witness recently to historic events in the Middle East of particular political importance .
Following the private meeting during the official visit between President Borrel and Prime Minister Arial Sharon last June , it would appear clear that the disengagement plan does not form part of a political process with the objective of an end to the occupation , the return of refugees and the foundation of an independent Palestinian state and I greatly fear that the of the occupation continue to exist .
Mr Sharon speaks in these interviews about addressing the risk of demographic change in Israel and about addressing the security problems of the Israeli occupying forces .
I believe that the departure of the settlers , in order to be a positive step and a window of opportunity , must be integrated into the framework of the implementation of the roadmap , without any new terms or conditions from the Israeli side .
There is a high rate of unemployment and poverty .
