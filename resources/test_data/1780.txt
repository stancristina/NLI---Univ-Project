I believe this fundamental revaluation to be important .
At any event , I should like to see islands and archipelagos given special treatment .
An important part of the policy may also consist of countries being given opportunities to receive certain smaller sums by way of general aid and of companies that maintain services of general interest being required to ensure that such services operate .
Finally , I wish to say that the concept of territorial cohesion was really originated by the CPMR under its then chairman , Stig Ã–stdahl .
People must be able to reside throughout Europe .
At the same time , there must also be a regional dimension to national policy , for every country has responsibility for there being regional solidarity within the Member States .
I am looking forward to a treaty in which territorial cohesion has an important role .
We must be able to live in these areas .
Mr President , Commissioner , I am among those who believe it is extremely important for us to involve the developing countries in trade and for us to open up our markets .
Mr President , I wish sincerely to thank Mrs Lynne for the effort she has put into the work on a legally binding UN Convention to promote and protect the rights and dignity of disabled people .
It is also important to emphasise that , if disabled people are given opportunities to live outside institutions , they must be offered sufficient support for doing so successfully .
As a Swedish Christian Democrat , I should like to have seen us in the European Parliament state that the future Convention should include wording concerning the right to life , implying that disabilities should not form a basis for diagnosing foetuses as unviable , for it is absolutely basic to our view of human beings that people with disabilities should not be looked down upon and their human dignity violated .
Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs .
Moreover , the victims - that is to say women and children - are often blamed .
We are responsible for working for the effective combating of violence in the EU.
The DAPHNE Programme has shown itself to be one of the most successful projects within the EU and has been adapted to many different types of difficulties and of problems involving violence that could not always be foreseen from the beginning .
This is an important period , however .
I think it is quite excellent to compare and evaluate the various national legislations .
In the same way , someone who hits women and children in the home should not be welcome there again .
I can make another comparison : that with a man in an Armani suit and wearing a Rolex watch who is walking around drunk in the middle of the night .
He is never asked what he is doing out at that time or why he is intoxicated .
Finally , I would again address the issue of the budget .
Mr President , I wish sincerely to thank Mr van den Bos for his devoted and far-sighted work on human rights in the world .
The European Parliament would point to the vulnerability experienced by members of religious minorities around the world .
We also indicate the important role of the media in disseminating knowledge of religions and cultures .
Finally , this important document contains legitimate repudiations of the choice of Libya as Chair of the UN Commission on Human Rights .
Even though we may have different views on certain parts of it , we should be able to agree that this survey is useful and significant .
What credibility would we then have in the surrounding world ?
There is a political anxiety whereby all the countries apparently feel able to compromise fundamental legal principles .
The second area is prison conditions .
The EU Charter of Fundamental Rights states clearly and unambiguously that '[t]he freedom and pluralism of the media shall be respected ' .
I agree with Mr Eurig Wyn on this matter and wonder if it is perhaps an irony of fate that it is the Italian Presidency that is to get the Member States to agree upon a constitution that Italy , through its prime minister 's monopoly on the media , clearly and unambiguously violates .
The situation in the Italian media is the whole of Europe 's responsibility , including yours , Mr Vitorino .
I want to thank my fellow MEP , Mr Ebner for all the hard work he has done .
I therefore believe it important for a relevant institute to be set up .
I want , however , to emphasise that we must investigate , and go more deeply into , the issue of an institute for linguistic diversity and language learning .
Obviously , we must make just as tough demands upon our own countries as upon the candidate countries and other countries outside the EU.
Before a child is sent back to his or her home country ( or another country ) , a careful investigation is made into who is to assume responsibility for them and receive them upon arrival .
Sometimes , not enough is found out about what happened to the child in his or her country of origin .
The Swedish labour market is regulated by collective agreements .
( SV ) Increased trade constitutes the developing countries ' greatest opportunity bar none for improving their economic position in the long term , together with poor people 's living conditions .
Aid to the developing countries ought therefore in the first place to be aimed at developing and improving such infrastructure as makes it easier for the developing countries to engage in trade .
We are not ill disposed towards a code of conduct with ethical clauses for companies that
