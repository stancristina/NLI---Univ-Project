data come from .
( NL ) Mr President , when , in 1997 , the European Parliament appointed me as the rapporteur for Slovakia 's EU membership application , some of my colleagues looked at me with pity .
In a sense these therefore constitute a threat to Slovak society .
We have been given assurances on the basis of which we can always call the new Member States to account after their accession .
So neither my last report , again today , nor the explanatory note I wrote with my recommendation are completely free from criticism .
The process of enlargement , about which everybody has fantasised in the past , is now being given flesh and bones .
At the time we thought : they all travel via Lithuania and we must reach agreement with Lithuania before Lithuania 's accession becomes a reality , because this is also a border problem .
Turkey 's position makes us feel all the more gloomy , because Turkey now has a black mark against an important political criterion in this area .
I regard enlargement as a consolidation of the area of freedom and democracy , the common judicial area and the increase in prosperity that this brings with it .
The real work , however , is about to begin .
Particularly with regard to flows of funds from Europe , the Commission should have much more power to tell a country in which things are going wrong - whether it is an old or a new Member State - that we will temporarily stop paying the money until we are satisfied that its administrative system has been put back on track .
Although I endorse what our group chairman , Mr Cohn-Bendit , has just said , I would like to place the emphasis on the minorities and their lot .
That applies in particular to the relationships between the EU and NATO .
.
No promises can therefore be made until the Intergovernmental Conference has been brought to a satisfactory conclusion .
The current Member States are furthermore complaining about corruption , labour migration and the high cost of relief funds .
This does not mean our work is done of course .
These efforts and the prospect of accession have brought stability and peace in Europe .
( NL ) I support the accession of the ten candidate countries today , in spite of the fact that some of them do not yet fully meet all the criteria .
We also lack a democratic and powerful government for Europe .
On 8 April I received a letter from Commissioner Verheugen saying that the Cyprus border , which is soon to be an external border of the Union and consequently of the Netherlands too , is sufficiently secure .
We further trust that a solution to the conflict in Cyprus will be found through the EU.
( NL ) Regarding the accession of the ten current candidate countries , the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party feels that candidate countries should actually have completed their preparations and that there should be individual country-by-country testing .
It may be that many people from Slovakia will choose to seek work in nearby Vienna .
The experience in Yugoslavia in particular , where it was not 'peacefulness ' and 'modesty ' that led to the reserved attitude of the European states , but 'cynicism ' and 'indifference ' , taught us this at the time .
The linking of these two is therefore a very important element , as it is in General Morillon 's report .
After all , no one will be at a loss regarding the question of which big country to follow : France , Germany , the United Kingdom or the United States .
We must not think that the European Union could break up into two groups , each with strengthened cooperation .
In addition to diplomacy , in addition to economic means , now military means too , but please in that order .
Then I am in favour of doing that first and only then to start discussing what for example I feel is some empty talk in Mr Morillon 's report , that is territorial defence .
The problem is that we do not spend it enough and not efficiently enough and that in the past we have done too little by way of task specialisation .
Agreed , my fellow MEPs , but then please on the basis of a clear strategic plan .
Doubt has therefore been sown , in public opinion too , about the ability of the European Union to speak to the outside world with one voice .
It will not make the European Union a military superpower .
Anyone wishing to take part must have the opportunity to do so .
What is more obvious than adequate input of the European Member States to NATO ?
Good Atlantic relations are of fundamental importance for Europe , for America and also for the rest of the world .
Mr President , I thank the Greek Presidency very much of course for the reply , but I must nonetheless express my disillusionment .
I would therefore like to ask the Greek Presidency to show more engagement in the matter and to ensure that action is actually taken .
Mr President , I recognise the objections of Commissioner Byrne to having organs covered by this directive as well , but there are also arguments in favour of it .
In the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , the Commission 's representative supported my Amendment No 99 on cells .
In this new directive , account can also be taken of the latest developments in the field of seeds .
Madam President , I would like to express a word of thanks to the Commissioner
