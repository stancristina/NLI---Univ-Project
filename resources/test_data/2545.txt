once more , are completely out of line with their discourse .
The framework directive on the harmonization of Member States ' legislation with regard to food additives has been in force since 1989 .
What is worse , the report that we have adopted inherently contradicts what is being proclaimed .
The very fact of having this declaration for small States means that the constituencies to which the first sentence of Article 2 relates are infra-national , territorial constituencies .
There was what the report calls an "initial contract ' between these members and the governing authorities of the European Movement which stated , in particular , that " the essential objective of the new electoral law should be to bring the electorate closer to the elected ( an extraordinary slip , incidentally ) by breaking up the framework of the single national constituency ' ( page 13 ) .
It is , however , regrettable to have to wait until 2009 to be able to elect 10 % of our Members within the single frontier of the Member States ; 60 Members elected by Europeans as a whole would have been a strong symbol of the construction of Europe if it had been applied from 2004 .
I would like to thank our colleague Georgios Anastassopoulos for the work he has carried out .
The 20th century must now come to a close with green taxes and we are presented with a new version of fiscal interventionism : taxes on CO2 and against pollution .
I will vote in favour of Mr Olsson 's report , for a tax system favouring the environment and based on the principle of " the polluter pays ' enables the encouragement of industrial and consumption practices more in favour of supporting sustainable development .
The system of green points in France , with the establishment of Eco-packaging and Adelphe also enables easy intra-Community trade .
It seems that many countries , having achieved the required performance in terms of respecting the convergence criteria have now let themselves go a little and there is a natural tendency to relax efforts which must , however , be continued .
Thirdly , what is the impact of the principles of longterm growth , prosperity and employment on the monetary projections which have been put forward ?
Naturally , our group will support Mr Four√ßans ' report .
What do you think of the presence of 11 representatives from national central banks of the euro area on the Economic and Financial Committee ?
This is why , although we accept the strengthening of certain constraints which the rapporteur proposes , we are far from agreeing with her on all issues , especially when it comes to an important legislative principle , the principle of proportionality .
Moreover , you get out of it what you put in .
This procedure is , however , not capable of responding to the major future challenges of the construction of Europe for it contains the seeds of its own destruction .
I would add that it is also a current need if progress is to be made on a whole series of issues .
Are we now going to place the people at the heart of this development dynamic ?
At a time when the European Commission 's translation services are seeking a hierarchy for documents so that , with the coming of enlargement which will bring the number of official languages up to sixteen , it will be possible to decide which texts require full translation , Mr Evans proposes a reform of the Rules of Procedure so that everyone can present petitions in a language other than the eleven official languages of the Union .
The Ombudsman 's efforts to clarify the concept are on the right track and should specify the respective duties of the Committee on Petitions and of the Ombudsman .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the Ombudsman on this second annual report , which sheds new light on the work which he carries out at the service of European citizens , now that the various services and infrastructures have become operational and links have been established between Member States and their national Ombudsmen .
But here again , if there is to be fruitful collaboration , we need partnerships which work well .
These are some of the questions which we really have to ask .
Extension of the scope of the directive to non-Member States of the Union raises difficult questions .
Alongside the contact group , and supporting its actions , the national diplomacies have an important role to play .
It is , in fact , prejudicial that the tools and analyses supplied are not more detailed .
Doing things more quickly and more briefly will not affect the basic problem .
At the same time , it increases the number of cases where this strengthened procedure can be applied to twenty-five new fields .
Yes , I am firmly convinced that we must continue to progress along this path ; the time seems to have returned for political decision , and it is essential to give the legislative power of the European Parliament its full meaning .
The Group of Independents of a Europe of Nations thinks that the various forms of cooperation in Europe must be left very free , under the control of the national parliaments .
Unfortunately , we must recognize that we are making only very slow progress in this field .
In order to ensure growth which accommodates the problematic issue of the environment , it is necessary to confront both the problem of the scarcity of resources and that of the link between jobs and the environment .
I would remind you that the Union 's cooperation with Togo was suspended in 1992 and that its resumption was conditional upon respect of democratic principles and the organization of fair and open elections in June 1998 .
