The interests of the people concerned should always come before meaningless one-upmanship .
Finally , it is fundamental to ensure direct support by the European Union to farmers who have lost their crops .
Every time that a European Member of Parliament comes here with another disaster , at present it is very difficult to measure the extent of the damage , and very often some of our colleagues look upon us with a certain amount of mistrust , with the thought that they are complaining and exaggerating in order to extract extra funds for their own region .
This is a situation which has arisen after terrible floods which have had tragic consequences : dozens of dead , some 400 , 000 homeless , 25 , 000 of whom are trying to find refuge in neighbouring countries , crops destroyed , infrastructures destroyed , problems of a possibility of epidemics , in particular of cholera and malaria , in other words a truly tragic situation , particularly important when we bear in mind that this is a very poor country .
The main reasons which have led me to vote in favour of this report , in its new form , are : the clear and systematic affirmation of the principle of economic and social cohesion ; -the elimination of any reference to subsidiarity ; -the express consideration that the Structural Funds make an important contribution to strengthening the economies of beneficiary regions and helping Member States to meet the convergence criteria and that the revision of regulations , to be presented by the end of 1998 , heads in the direction of rationalisation and increased efficiency ; -the condemnation of the negative attitude of the Council in relation to social policy ( compulsory approval by unanimity ) and the decision to include pilot projects on social exclusion , the elderly , the disabled and families , as well as strengthening activities designed to help with the execution of a sexual equality policy ; -the willingness of the European Parliament to make an active contribution to setting up at European level a general policy to combat organised crime ; -the importance of making budgetary allowances for the new needs of European citizens and promoting in practice the creation of jobs , both directly and by means of support to small and medium-sized undertakings .
Against that background the report presented to us today here for our vote deserves our full support .
The concerns brought to us by this report - and I must very warmly congratulate Mrs Boogerd-Quaak on her excellent work - on the basis of the Commission document , are very relevant , they are some of the most essential concerns and they deserve a different degree of attention and another position on our agenda .
We , Europe , are a continent which is losing in terms of demographic weight .
Mr President , before the sitting begins I should like to mention here a political incident which does not appear to me to be very pleasant in so far as it concerns the Honourable Member , Mr Martens , who stated in Lisbon that the party with which I cooperate is a party of the extreme right .
( The President cut the speaker off )
( The President cut the speaker off ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is important to mention that we have nothing against research into and use of bio-technology in agriculture and I must underscore and stress that this is a field in which safety , the risk to foodstuffs , the protection of public health and environmental protection simply must come first in the decisions to be taken .
Mr President , Madam Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to raise four questions which I regard as fundamental in this debate : First : I think that the composition of genetically modified products ought to be stated in more detail , as medicines are today , as are the foodstuffs we all know and eat as a matter of course .
I shall simply say that I entirely support what my colleague , Mr Ford , said on the matter .
These standards are very often inadequate because they are not based on the lowest common denominator .
We therefore think we should once again condemn the insistence upon and speeding up of economic strategies and policies which led to these situations , since it is clear that they could not improve trends before making them worse .
Economic , but not solely economic .
I voted against those paragraphs mentioning individual Member States which have not had the opportunity to put their side of the case which must be regarded as States following the Rule of Law , plus those paragraphs dealing with national policies on asylum and immigration when there is still no real European policy in this area ; I abstained on those paragraphs on human rights outside the European Union or concerning events in years other than 1995 and on paragraphs which wove fact in with fiction .
There is a growing tendency to curb the right of asylum .
The Palacio Vallelersundi report is a serious and balanced piece of work , since it tries to reconcile the various conflicting interests - those of the dealers and those of the artists .
Since the law in Portugal is considerably more severe than the present proposal for a directive , I should like to stress the clear advantage of giving consideration to the following amendments proposed by the Committee on Culture which reflect the unanimous concerns of artists : the lowering of the minimum threshold for the application of the provisions of Article 3 ; the amending of the sliding scale of percentages provided for in Article 4 ; the promotion of the joint administration
