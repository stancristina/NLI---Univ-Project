and can play a decisive role in winning the battle to establish an international system of justice .
The ad hoc tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda have certainly served to further demonstrate , if that were possible , the need to set up this international criminal court .
Justice is the only way to combat impunity .
I think we need to support them in these activities , because that will be the best way to implement this permanent court .
The President-in-Office of the Council mentioned the European internal market several times , but she did not say much about the need to increase levels of competitiveness once we have Monetary Union and the euro .
What do you mean when you say you are going to examine the matter ?
The explanation you just gave was not really clear .
For example , I do not know if you are aware that the Israeli Prime Minister , in an interview to the Spanish newspaper El País published last Sunday , said that the Europeans know nothing about the Middle East .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , thank you for your answer .
On the contrary , it is meant in a positive sense .
The British government recognized that fact many years ago in an official communication to the United Nations , which has never been amended .
In a " Senior Citizens ' Parliament ' held in Luxembourg , one of the main concerns was that their knowledge and experience was not given sufficient recognition and that the community should exploit this experience and learning for the benefit of society .
We concern ourselves too much with the indices of economic convergence , and not enough with the indices of social convergence .
Judicial proceedings are not unified and there are very different legal and procedural systems throughout the various Member States .
Nonetheless , some amendments have been tabled , in spite of this request , in reference to the fact that traders and industrial associations , amongst others , are not included in the directive .
Nevertheless , the Group of the European People 's Party has tabled four amendments , which bring together most of the ideas approved at first reading and recognized by the Commission in its amended proposal .
Secondly , also concerning the field of application , I must state that there is no sense in separating the interests of consumers and the interests of other collective organizations recognized in those directives since , in fact , its aim is to enhance the smooth running of the internal market .
Let us take the example of the first directive listed , concerning misleading advertising .
Mr President , as regards the Minutes , under Question Time it states that Question No 2 had been withdrawn , and that it was a question by Mr Carlos Carnero .
These amendments are aimed solely at improving the conditions for the young people who carry out voluntary service , rather than discouraging them from getting involved .
Mr President , I would like to begin by stating that the Group of the Party of European Socialists supports Mr Colajanni 's report .
In Parliament we always persevere and are constantly prepared to fight for our principles .
This amendment is aimed at ensuring that the European Parliament 's voice is heard when that forum considers that an essential element is lacking in order to continue with the support measures for a Mediterranean partner .
That deferment showed how delicate and difficult this matter is for the Member States of the European Union .
Today we are talking about Jesús María Valle Jaramillo , and we must remember that both he and Josué Girardo have been here in this Parliament explaining the human rights situation in Colombia to the Members .
They were young university students , and human rights activists who belonged to the CINEP , a very prestigious Centre for popular education and research in Colombia .
I do not know who is going to try to defend human rights in Colombia with all these murders .
This commitment has been confirmed through a series of actions , Mr President .
And both the Nicaraguan authorities - the government is currently headed by Mr Violeta Chamorro - and the leaders of the opposition talked to us about the terrible debt problem they face .
As long as 50 % of the population is unemployed and does not receive any assistance , and as long as 70 % of the population experiences such extreme poverty and the country has such a high level of external debt , democracy there will be purely nominal .
When we read the terrible reports , as we did yesterday , about very young children who are able to cut off the heads or arms of their fellow countrymen with a machete , we really shudder at the hatred that has been instilled in them .
The report I have the privilege of presenting summarizes these meetings .
We believe that this is very important , and that it is now time to move away from the somewhat absurd situation in which we find ourselves , that is , where we have two separate electoral colleges : the Europeans on one side and the ACP countries on the other .
In addition , the ACP countries should understand - and we are calling on them to do so - that the European Parliament is particularly concerned with defending the values of democracy and the rule of law .
These are the most important points in the motion for a resolution adopted by the Committee on Development and Cooperation which I have had the privilege to present to the House .
However , we believe that we should take this opportunity to look at the various current control and inspection systems used in the NAFO regulatory area
