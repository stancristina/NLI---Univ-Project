Unless we lend a little support to banana production , I do not see what alternatives we might offer .
Mr President , I must say that I cannot see in Agenda 2000 the historic values on which the idea of the European Community was founded .
That will maintain a schizophrenic Europe , one divided between extremely poor countries and countries that are not poor for natural reasons or for reasons linked to their own national history .
Finally , in Agenda 2000 , the least-favoured regions will continue to be least-favoured and the most-favoured will become richer and richer .
Undoubtedly , there is an ambition : that of enlargement .
For our part , we are clearly in favour of the former option .
That option would inevitably result in the sacrifice of economic and social cohesion .
My country and other Member States have made an enormous effort and , against all the odds , they have succeeded in meeting the conditions for participating fully in the euro .
Whoever agrees with that reduction , tantamount to a reduction in the Structural Funds - which would lose my country hundreds of billions of escudos - will be voting for the report .
In other words , all countries with a GNP lower than 90 % of the Community average should benefit from the Cohesion Fund , whether or not they belong to the group of countries participating in the single currency .
As for the FIFG , we support the strategy of the report aimed at unifying regulations on activities in this sector , but we do not feel it necessary or even appropriate to present such a complete document at this stage as , for that very reason , we have not been able to sufficiently discuss all its implications .
On the other hand , the Cohesion Fund is fundamental for sustainable development in environmental terms , as was stipulated in the Amsterdam Treaty .
Therefore , not only is the Commission 's decision in keeping with the treaties , but it is also in keeping with the spirit of Edinburgh : that of a cohesive Europe embracing solidarity .
But we do have some objections .
And this issue conditions all the others .
These are proposals without any substantial justification since it is a structural fund aimed at bringing about real convergence among the countries with per capita GDPs less than 90 % of the Community average .
It is a Treaty that , without any reservations , rightly won the support of the European Parliament and has been ratified by all the Member States .
What are the main issues of concern for the European Parliament that led to the tabling of this oral question ?
Fourthly , we should strike more of an internal balance within the CAP by strengthening the so-called second pillar of rural development .
Those aims have always been pursued and reiterated by the Commission and the Council .
The European Parliament has reached a broad consensus on the CAP but the question of financing at this stage cannot be allowed to poison our debate , nor should it be allowed to divide us .
As you have just said , Commissioner , this reform is going to lead more people away from the countryside .
That is the fundamental issue at stake because today 's problem is whether the Commissioner or the Council are going to put a complete end to aid to production .
I voted in favour of this report in the final vote because I feel that , in the end , it does not compromise Portugal 's specific interests in the negotiations on Agenda 2000 , despite relevant factors with regard to economic and social cohesion .
Obviously , we should emphasise the fact that maintenance of the Cohesion Fund for Portugal should not be seen as something of enormous importance but instead as a simple confirmation that this was conceded a long time ago in the negotiation process on the next Community support framework .
In other words , the proposal sets out to correct the situation in Germany 's favour and , in particular , to the detriment of France 's current Community budget situation , but without safeguarding the situation of other Member States such as Portugal .
This does not seem to be a problem concerning the CAP but one that has been created to deal with certain countries ' financial contributions to the budget .
This instrument could also help to reduce some serious , well-known imbalances .
For agro-environmental measures , it establishes a regulation that really seems to be a measure to help the farms and finances of certain Member States , small in number , in the centre and north of the European Union .
That is why we abstained in this vote .
Sudden alterations of behaviour in apparently normal people - some of them familiarly normal , professional people - demonstrate the effects of these miraculous capsules of instantaneous performance , the key to voluptuous physical states and mental capacities .
Even the Internet offers recipes for producing these super-drugs with potentially lethal effects .
In the meantime , the market novelties are called DOB , Golden Eagle , 4MTA , and flatliners , which are 33 times stronger than Ecstasy .
Undoubtedly we should .
Finally , on a subject that was a burning issue some time ago , perhaps we should take care not to moralise and stir up trouble about the cost of members ' travel expenses , especially in the case of people who come to meetings from a very long way away .
Under the terms of its statutes there can clearly only be national representations , but that makes it vital for the EU to have
