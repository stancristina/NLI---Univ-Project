, with many important countries in the Security Council , and with non-European countries and non-members of the Security Council .
Because there is absolutely no doubt that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is going to be the great issue which we Europeans are going to have to deal with in the coming years and we will have to genuinely take on board the importance of this issue .
As regards establishing democracy , we trust the Pretoria Agreement will prove an effective measure and will be implemented in sensible stages .
The major problem I have in mind is that of a system of justice .
The Group of the Party of European Socialists will relentlessly pursue its campaign demanding transparency and ethical standards from multinational companies in the developing world .
The figure for 2001 was 16 % .
It is essential to improve management of the recovery of unduly paid funds in order to improve budgetary control .
Concerning my first point , I fully support Mr Blak 's amendment .
I should point out , as the Commissioner has already , that 2000 was a transitional year .
Further , regarding the issue of the recovery of unduly paid funds , I would like to highlight that these are Community funds .
Firstly , there is a critical and rigorous assessment of the reform .
In my view , the critical assessment and concern detailed in this report constitute a timely warning .
We have finally reached an agreement and I would like to congratulate Mrs Hautala on such a satisfactory outcome .
It is therefore important for the Commission to assess the progress made .
Countries have undertaken to reach specific targets .
Mr President , I very much regret that the Commissioner is unable to be with us .
I would venture to say that we are numbered amongst the lucky few who live comfortably , in an affluent society .
Hunger cannot wait .
The causes of hunger and underdevelopment are many and varied .
Urgent action must also be taken to ensure the development of viable networks for local distribution , access to land and to water and the cancellation of foreign debt .
As indicated in our resolution , I also believe it is particularly important to facilitate access to the markets on equal terms , and on a reciprocal basis .
Peace itself is at stake , at both a social and international level .
It runs counter to solidarity and should only be applied in the case of over-protected and more developed markets .
Mr President , we wish to table an oral amendment to the fourth indent .
Mr President , on a point of order , I would like to extend my sympathy to the family of Joseba Pagazaurtundua , whom I knew personally .
Our failure on this approach has meant a further descent into renewed clashes .
Mr President , we have just heard from the lips of Mr Gorostiaga a defence of murder as a method for resolving political conflicts .
Mr President , I would like to say solemnly here in this House that the presence of Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso in this Parliament degrades the European Union , it brings shame on this House , and words cannot express , while the body of an honoured public servant is still warm , the nausea , disgust and repugnance the presence of this individual in a House of democracy and freedoms causes me .
Europe has a vital interest in this issue .
In Porto Alegre , local authorities , members of parliament , trade unions , non-governmental organisations , judges and teachers proposed - perhaps idealistically - that another world is possible , and not just possible , but necessary .
The participation of European parliamentarians in Porto Alegre is a good symptom , but the European Union 's partnership with citizens ' movements must go further .
It is also regrettable - as other speakers have said - that the unilateral position of the United States in this regard is having a bearing on one of the most negative aspects of the process of neoliberal globalisation we are suffering , which consists of increasing inequalities and hindering and weakening the situation of the countries with fewest resources .
We therefore have to understand that it is the European Union , which is based on a desire for peace , development and solidarity , which can introduce elements to ensure a rebalance within the context of this neoliberal process of globalisation which is under way in order to provide it with the elements which - as has been said during the previous debate - arose from the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre .
We are talking about aspects such as total decoupling which , as well as being rejected by many MEPs - including myself - is also opposed by professions and many Member States .
We must recognise the right of the less developed countries to protect themselves from these subsidised exports in order to safeguard their fundamental right to food security , to food sovereignty and to the survival of their small-scale and family-run farms .
I would also like to say that the commitment to greater openness must be accompanied by a fair distribution of responsibilities amongst the developed countries .
Madam President , European citizenship was one of the great achievements of the Union Treaty adopted in Nice in 1992 .
I am referring to Amendment No 23 - which introduces a new Article 4( b ) - which says that ' This Directive shall not lead to the withdrawal of existing rights established by the legislation of the European Union or Court of Justice decision ' .
The same right , with a similar wording , is conferred on the European citizen by Article 45( 1 ) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , and this seems to us very significant
