A missile shield will militarise space , since antiballistic missiles operate in space .
The result of this will be a renewed arms race , but in response to the USA 's example we too are making a small decision on principle here : in our opinion Galileo may be used for military purposes in peacekeeping operations .
This must be the main goal of the Union .
There will always be those who are ready to carry out absurd acts .
But even small steps are necessary in order to ensure flexible transportation .
I thank those who have drafted the reports for their splendid work and , for example , Mr Grosch for his positive and constructive attitude to his colleagues ' proposals for amendments .
Anything else would of course be a senseless waste of resources .
We allow lorries six and a half metres longer than elsewhere in the EU.
The advantages here are obvious even to the layman .
The combination of improved traffic flow and the economy of scale would lead to a cleaner environment .
This is precisely what is announced in the Transport White Paper ; merci , madame Palacio Vallelersundi .
It should be remembered that road transport is far and away the most important mode of transportation in Europe , which in addition to everything else offers door-to-door service .
The last thing we should do , however , is to throw a spanner in the works for road transport .
I believe that these proposals are a step in the right direction .
These actions will improve traffic safety , and this is an important matter .
A reasonably balanced common position on the maximum authorised dimensions for vehicles has been achieved , as the rapporteur Mr Hatzidakis stated .
The time made available for this is now truly sufficient .
The adoption of a standardised driver 's certificate will promote fair competition in the sector and will also improve traffic safety .
At the same time it will also be possible to raise the prestige of the sector and to increase its attraction to young people .
The basic training requirement for drivers must not however prevent existing drivers from returning to the sector .
Account is taken of this in the report .
The training programme must be drafted in such a way that the length of one course section should be at least seven hours .
Mr President , more and more often in present-day society we are seeing situations where legislators are expected to enact laws very quickly and effectively .
Unfortunately , a modern legislative process often seems to mean that it is the European Parliament that is expected to give up some of the legislative powers it enjoys by virtue of the Treaty .
As President of this institution , you will surely seize on the proposal that the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has put forward : whenever the European Parliament suspects that the Commission is using more than its fair share of powers of implementation , you could negotiate an ad hoc scrutiny mechanism to prevent Parliament ' s legislative powers from being watered down .
We all know that Parliament ' s legislative power is not an end in itself : we really try to ensure , on behalf of the public , that decisions are taken openly and democratically , and that all views worthy of attention are taken into consideration during the process .
The Commission ' s commitment to amending Article 202 of the Treaty in the very near future , which would restore Parliament ' s legislative and supervisory powers , is to be welcomed with open arms .
The Commission examines the Internal Market Strategy each year to evaluate the results achieved and suggest improvements .
The Commission also monitors developments in the business climate for small enterprises with reference to the yearly report on the European Charter for Small Enterprises .
The report for 2002 will be coming out in the next few days and will assess the action to help small businesses that the Member States and the Commission have said they are taking .
At this stage I might say that there has been progress .
He will work in the Enterprise Directorate-General and his job will be to act as liaison officer on issues such as opportunities for SMEs to acquire funding and exploit innovation as well as matters to do with competitiveness , better regulation , implementation of the internal market process , participation in EU programmes and how best to enhance consultation procedures .
Six events have been planned for this year in different Member States and there is to be a large-scale conference in Brussels .
The proposals relate to the whole lifecycle of Community acts .
Under discussion are , for example , the need for more effective consultation with interest groups and civil society , an evaluation of Community action and costs , and a simplification of current laws .
The Enterprise Directorate-General will be actively involved in drawing up this plan and drawing on the experience gained from the business impact assessment system and the test project connected with it .
Mr President , I agree with the honourable Member that words are words and only actions are important .
I am prepared to go back over this matter with the honourable Member in minute detail .
Mr President , Commissioner , this electronic Europe project met with enormous difficulties when spectrum auctions started to be held .
It resulted in bankruptcies , which are still continuing , and unemployment .
It allows for the creation of what are now new bodies : a committee , to discuss long-term questions , and a working party , to consider the current administration .
The market will be able to act more wisely when it is known at least how things are moving in different regions of Europe
