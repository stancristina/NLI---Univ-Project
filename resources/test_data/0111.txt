will assume if it tries to replace the Convention 's political consensus with a different , governmental consensus .
Nor can any nationalist neuroses make us forget how valuable European unity is for governing Europeans , and , of course , for curbing the supremacy - and very often the stupidity - of other parts of the world .
We live in a time when discoveries - a common heritage for all of us - are being confused with inventions .
I entirely agree with this principle , since we cannot ignore the fact that any piece of software is the product of a mental process enabling a human being to command an unintelligent machine to perform a series of instructions .
A patent must not be reduced to the status of a trophy for whoever gets to the competent authority first with an application for a particular patent .
Furthermore , I would rather the proposal had been rejected and the process started all over again on the basis of a fresh report , as I also proposed .
While I feel that the financial package should be more generous , I support this initiative , which was unanimously approved by the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .
( PT ) We could only vote in favour of this report , given that what is at stake is financing a high common level of consumer protection , effective enforcement of consumer protection rules , and the involvement of consumer organisations in EU policies , even though this report looks no further than questions of consumer safety relating to non-food products , protecting the economic interests of consumers , and promoting consumer organisations at European level , as well as the involvement of those organisations in Community policies relevant to their interests .
These objectives are to strive for a high common level of consumer protection and effective enforcement of consumer protection rules , and to ensure that consumer organisations are involved in EU policies .
This Council compromise , therefore , constitutes a significant step in that direction , since it has brought agreement on a comprehensive energy tax directive , encompassing all forms of energy .
It is not sensitive to levels of income and penalises lower-income households .
This requires a high degree of state intervention and investment .
In other words , the price of goods must reflect their real environmental cost .
( PT ) I voted in favour of this report , since I feel it is necessary to face up to climate change and the growing threats to the environment , using taxation as an additional tool to that end .
.
The extension is thus essential and for that reason I support it , although I regret the delay in referring this protocol to Parliament for consideration .
We are faced with an urgent need to reform social protection systems .
For these reasons , I voted in favour of this report .
This , I am happy to say , is the case in Portugal .
The Union has acquired legal personality , and the longed-for disappearance of the pillar structure has become a reality .
I feel , however , that the aforesaid amendment is essentially correct in pointing out one of the weaknesses of the draft Constitution presented to the Intergovernmental Conference by the Convention .
As we have complained in the past , the undemocratic methods and processes by which the Convention was constituted helped produce a text to which we are flatly opposed , since we disagree with the social project it advocates .
Instead of selecting as absolute priorities the quest for peace , development , and economic and social cohesion , based on high levels of social welfare for all , this text defines peace as a mere possibility and not as a fundamental objective .
The United Nations General Assembly has criticised the Israeli Government in this connection .
Peace will come only when the Palestinian people 's inalienable and widely-acknowledged right to their own independent , sovereign state becomes reality .
This was due to the CAP reform it has carried out , and the agreement it has concluded with the United States of America .
Furthermore , the voices of the world 's poorest countries , which enjoy completely free access to our markets as a result of the 'Everything but Arms ' initiative , were not even heard .
Thirdly , however , I would also like to remind you of the major popular demonstrations in Cancún and , to a degree , all over the world , protesting against the injustice of globalisation and demanding new , fairer , and more democratic rules .
Hence , it is important that the Member States should find ways of making basic information available free of charge , ensuring that it is accessible to all , especially via the Internet and other accessible means , and paying particular attention to people with disabilities .
The high level of public health protection to which the European Union aspires means that great care must be taken when placing on the market and/or distributing products containing substances that are hazardous to human health .
The necessary measures need to be put in place to achieve full compliance in the implementation of the regulation and to ensure complete transparency and the right of access to documents by the citizens .
I realise , however , that the individual character of the Community institutions means that the extent of public availability of documents is not and cannot be the same in all the institutions .
One must not , however , forget that the failure of the negotiations at the Fifth WTO Ministerial Conference at Cancún was due to the refusal of the more-developed countries to find solutions that were fair to the developing countries .
