The report’s single ambition is to cultivate mutual trust in the principle of mutual recognition of the other Member States’ legal decisions .
What matters is surely what happens in reality .
If reality had had a role to play and if the criminologists had been asked , a clear answer would have been received .
I also wish to thank Commissioner Almunia for a thoughtful contribution and for his commitment to a reform of the Stability and Growth Pact , as presented .
The Conservatives and Liberals here in Parliament focus upon structural reforms – about which we are prepared to negotiate , I should like to say – not only in the European Parliament but also in our individual states .
We want to see the correct reforms .
I would add one thing , however : Europe’s main problems do not only include the need for structural reforms ; its second big problem is that demand in our countries is too low .
I would make a genuine and urgent appeal to the leaders of the right-of-centre European parties .
I would therefore make a very urgent appeal for the European dimension to be introduced .
What the European dimension genuinely involves is our learning to do things simultaneously .
In that way , we should obtain the extra growth we need .
We are , however , aware of the fact that the proposal concerns an area covered by Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community and does not , therefore , apply to Denmark , cf . the Protocol on Denmark’s Position .     Mr President , I should firstly like to thank the Commissioner for his answer .
I do not know if everyone is aware of how much money is involved – at least EUR 6 billion per year .
This could not ever possibly be obtained using just one fund .
Irrespective of ways and means , we must have this project integrated into the other funds , and that is something on which we agree .
We shall support the Commission in this matter , and I must also say that the green movements , Bird Life etc are in favour of our having the funding of Natura 2000 integrated .
Mr Florenz provided an engaging description of the conflicts that will arise .
Purely for the sake of funding , we therefore need a clearer answer from the Commission than we have received so far .
It is also an issue of getting the whole of our rural districts policy in tune with the natural environment , so that agriculture is carried on , and development pursued , in these areas in ways that respect the vulnerable natural environment instead of , as now , in ways that include driving large road systems through vulnerable areas .
We therefore need also to take account of the way in which we develop rural districts and to ensure that Natura 2000 is incorporated and that there is enough money .
There are such large sums allocated to direct agricultural aid that it is time we began to look at this aid .     Madam President , I should firstly like to thank Mr Grosch for a really constructive piece of work and to congratulate him on this .
I think that some sterling work has been done , and I also think it splendid that Mr Grosch has shifted attention away from some rather abstract fight against terrorism , or whatever it was to begin with , to the issue of road safety and of the real terror we have in Europe whereby the number of people killed and maimed on our roads is equivalent to the number of casualties that would occur if one jumbo jet per week were to crash , killing everyone on board .
It is really important that we get something done about this , and a prior condition – or one of the prior conditions – for getting something done is , of course , that we have driving licences that can be checked up on and that are recognised throughout Europe .
I think it excellent that we have not subjected our elderly people to more tests .
If only fit and healthy people would put careful driving before over-confidence .
There are countries – and I do not believe that the whole of the Group of the European People’s Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats fall into this camp – that apparently attach inordinate value to their driving licences .
In that way , we should obtain a driving licence we can use in the rest of Europe .
We tried it in Denmark , and it worked .
The Commission has just completed an analysis of the measures taken as part of the European forestry strategy over the last five years , and we shall shortly present the results of this analysis , both to the European Parliament and to the Council .
In my view , the Council Resolution of 15 December on a forestry strategy for the European Union forms a suitable basis for the forestry-related measures and initiatives in the EU.
With regard to the damage that occurred in connection with the latest storm , which also caused a lot of damage in other northern European countries too , I should like , in this House too , to express my sincere sympathy with those who were affected by this disaster .
We are ready as quickly as possible to look into what we can do to remedy the consequences .
At the request of a country affected by a disaster , the Community action programme for coordinated civil protection in the event of a disaster can form the basis for both facilitating and coordinating aid for other Member States .
It was , in actual fact , possible to comply with the wish within a time frame of less than two days ,
