The delegation wishes to emphasise , however , that it does support the enforcement of intellectual property rights .
As I also said in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , we naturally support the exercise of weeding out superfluous legislation , but we must make sure that the legislation we are eliminating is indeed superfluous .
I support better regulation only if the intention is to make legislation more transparent and flexible , and not if it really means deregulation .
The 25 % reduction target laid down is open to doubt , however , as it was chosen at random .
If the legislation is superfluous , we should not be stopping at 25 % .
On the whole , however , I fully agree with the objective of the exercise , and I recognise that the EU 's unnecessary administrative burdens undermine the effectiveness and credibility of EU legislation .
Madam President , I should like to thank the Committee on Legal Affairs and the rapporteur for a sound report on 'soft law ' - a dirty word that fortunately does not exist in Danish .
In 2005 the Commission 's internal market experts issued a recommendation on copyright protection for composers and authors .
The Danish copyright society KODA has been constantly threatened with a fine of 10 % of its turnover since 1973 .
The recommendation and competition case together amount to hard law and expropriation - which constitutes an infringement of EU law , as that effect can only legally be produced by means of legislation .
Instead , it should be putting forward a proposal for a directive on artists ' copyright and rights agencies , as we requested in the Lévai report .
We reject administrative legislation for the benefit of a handful of multinationals .
Elected representatives should always be consulted before the Commission issues such recommendations .
Mr President , I should like to start by commending Mr Toubon on the very fine job he has done .
I am also obliged to my fellow shadow rapporteurs from the other groups , especially Mr Harbour from the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , for their constructive cooperation .
I should like to emphasise first of all the liberalisation of the postal market , which I consider extremely necessary and important , and also the increased competition on the energy market and general improvements in competition policy .
The objective is clear : we want to see a barrier-free Single Market .
After all , that is the essence of the Single Market .
The report represents a stimulus to the Commission , a contribution to the Lisbon Strategy , a call for Europe to go up a gear if we want to join the top level and withstand competitive pressure from China and the United States in particular .
That way , I am convinced that the Single Market will go from strength to strength , to the benefit of our enterprises , large and small , and also of citizens .
A barrier-free Single Market will generate more jobs and growth , which is a precondition for our ability to fund the European welfare state - and the European public will be the real winners .
It is not only the Commission who must read this report , however .
If we advocate a barrier-free Single Market , we cannot , and should not , accept a situation in which two major countries continue to hinder , not to say undermine , a free energy market .
The delegation believes that minimum harmonisation is necessary whilst such great disparities remain in the level of consumer protection in the Member States .
The delegation believes that the wording , among other things , conflicts with the Danish system of excise duties .
The Danish members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament - Mr Rasmussen , Mrs Thomsen , Mrs Schaldemose , Mr Jørgensen and Mr Christensen - have voted against not only the Commission 's proposals but also the amendments proposed by Parliament .
The delegation believes that support for high-fat milk should be abolished completely , whilst healthy milk should receive the greatest support .
The June Movement supports warning labels on alcoholic beverages .
When these proposals return to Parliament , we shall work towards minimum labelling rules , so that Member States can legislate in line with the precautionary principle .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I should like to commend Mrs Valenciano on her well-balanced report , and to thank her for being so obliging in incorporating many of the amendments presented by our committee .
The EU must enhance its role as a proactive actor when it comes to promoting human rights , and so I am pleased that the Council has taken the initiative in incorporating human rights into EU policy .
It is only by systematising the dialogues that we can improve the use of benchmarks and bring coherence to endeavours to promote human rights .
Dialogue must be used to open up an engaging , confidence-inspiring political space that , rather than only ever identifying violations , also identifies progress in the human rights field .
The human rights situation in a number of countries gives cause for concern .
Trade agreements with third countries should be seen as a tool with consequences reaching beyond the purely economic .
The dialogue with third countries must help strengthen democratic , social , political and environmental rights , and therefore it should also be made clear that trade agreements must contain an unambiguous mechanism for how and when agreements can be suspended in the event that one trading partner fails to comply with human rights or democracy clauses .
There can be no doubt , however , that the greatest progress is achieved by giving
