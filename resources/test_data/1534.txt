The option accorded to States by the next paragraph of the same article to regulate the exhaustion of the above right is dangerous and is one of the Treaty ' s most negative points , since there is nothing to prevent States from enacting special conditions for the exhaustion of the right , a thing that would be to the disadvantage of artists .
In the 21st century , the century of knowledge and the invisible economy , intellectual property will be the dominant form of property and will , in many cases , be more important than traditional property .
( EL ) Despite the relative improvement of the first draft of the directive on water policy , following the incorporation of some of the European Parliament ' s amendments in the Council ' s common position , the directive remains problematic .
( EL ) On reading the Commission ' s statement on social protection , which is animated by so many good intentions , one wonders whether its authors and the working people in Europe are living on the same continent and in the same social reality .
One also wonders whether this 'coordinated modernisation strategy ' is not just another misrepresentation of the coordinated and headlong attack on social protection and security and on the acquired rights of working people .
Its sole purpose is to pave the way and create the right conditions for cutting public expenditure on social security , and for flexibilising social protection itself .
It is well known that the level and quality of employment determines the quality of social security systems .
On the basis of these views , we wish to express our categorical opposition to the 'modernisation ' of the social protection system that the Commission statement is promoting , and to make it clear that we cannot vote in favour of the report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs which is under discussion .
For example , I would not refer to the government of Nicosia .
I cannot understand why the two small countries must be treated differently , nor why a clash was necessary between the institutional bodies .
As the Commissioner said , and I agree with him , it is a matter of political decision .
Regardless of the national origin of each Cypriot , the future of the Cypriot people must involve the unity of that small country .
Even in this Chamber , the Council ' s representative referred to the north of Cyprus and not to the occupied territories .
On their course towards accession , the people of Cyprus have already lost a great deal , but stand to lose even more .
Mr President , this is one of the few occasions when , from what the speakers have said in this Parliament , from all sides of the House , there is clearly the greatest convergence of views on the Cyprus issue and , of course , on the pre-accession process for Cyprus and Malta .
If , for any reason , the balance achieved there should be considered by some to be a point of departure for new negotiations anywhere else , if some people destabilise this totality of facts and equilibrium by their attitude , they will be making a tragic mistake .
In any event , the outcome is in your hands .
From that standpoint , Aphrodite ' s island , as Cyprus is known , and the pirates ' island , as we islanders say of Malta with great affection , are two jewels which should be welcomed into the European Union without delay .
They have healthy economies , high-level economic relations , and in the final analysis they constitute a testing ground for the European Union ' s political will .
I hope there has been an interpretation error , and that he will clarify the matter in his follow-up speech .
As many speakers have said , we have a state of occupation ; occupation by a country applying for membership of the European Union - Turkey - of part of another country that is also applying for membership .
What issues will it raise concerning the withdrawal of troops and the Turkish Government ' s contribution towards resolving the Cyprus issue ?
Of course , the situation was not idyllic , even before the bombardments , anything but , I should say .
I thank the President-in-Office but I do not agree with him that the purpose of NATO' s intervention was to stop a humanitarian disaster , because we have a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo today , we have the hell of Milosevic , followed by the hell of the KLA and the NATO forces .
It was NATO' s interventions and initially those of Germany which led to all that has happened .
We have 350 000 Serbians , Gypsies and other nationalities , besides Albanian Kosovars , who have been expelled .
He has created a separate currency , a judicial body ...
Destabilisation began around ten years ago with the break-up of Yugoslavia , in which the European Union played a decisive part .
In my opinion , the best thing the Council could do would be to cease occupying that part of Yugoslavia and search for a solution acceptable to all sides , with respect for the various national characteristics in the area and especially respect for the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of another , independent country .
As a supplementary question , I should like to ask you whether , as the Portuguese Presidency , you have made provision for the rights of children , as such , to be included in future deliberations and the rights to be incorporated in the Charter .
The report accepts these attitudes along with the more general policy of the European Union on south-eastern Europe .
Mr President , Commissioner , one of the most basic aims of the European
