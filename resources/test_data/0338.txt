the euro .
That is precisely what they are .
Europe needs a strong common regulation of the financial sector , but a large degree of flexibility when it comes to what economic policy will best tackle the crisis in the individual countries .
I think we have achieved a very good result .
The simple fact of the matter is that we use too much on our planet .
We use resources quicker than they are able to replenish themselves .
This has to change if we want to prevent an environmental crisis .
The Ecolabel that is currently being revised is a tool intended to encourage the production and sale of goods produced in a sustainable manner .
If producers cannot use the label to market a good product , why would they then attempt to produce the most sustainable product within a particular product group ?
There is now a clear requirement for Member States and the Commission to produce an action plan to promote awareness of the Ecolabel through various campaigns .
The Commission 's proposal to consider only processed foods and only transport , packaging and processing is not the end of the matter .
Finally , I would like to point out that the label now also benefits goods produced to last a long time and goods that can be re-used .
It requires us to look at the whole of a product 's lifecycle , so that we can improve the way raw materials are treated during the production of a product and , in particular , the way we dispose of a product after use .
I hope that the tool that we have improved here will be a good one for promoting a more sustainable planet .
Mr President , our review of the accounts for 2007 shows that this year , yet again , we quite simply are not sufficiently able to manage the large resources provided to the EU by the Member States .
Allow me to quote from one of these reports .
I acknowledge that all of the EU 's enormous network of legislation and administrative bodies , combined with poor administration and blatant corruption in some Member States , make responsible financial management difficult , but this is , and will remain , unacceptable .
My little country , Denmark , will be paying almost DKK 20 billion to the EU this year .
Even sending the Member States ' money for redistribution via Brussels involves a reduction in the net value of this money and contributes to an increase in the unlawful use of citizens ' money .
Finally , I would like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control , Mr Bösch , for his outstanding management of its work , and I would also like to thank the rapporteur , my fellow Members , the committee 's secretariat and everyone involved for their exceptional commitment and very constructive cooperation .
We do not believe that a ban on trading in seal products will improve animal welfare and we find it regrettable that the proposal was adopted despite having no basis in the Treaty .
I recognise the importance of the resolution 's aim of improving the human rights situation in a number of vulnerable countries .
I share its ambition to abolish the use of the death penalty and improve the working situation of human rights campaigners and NGOs .
Nonetheless , I cannot vote in favour of the resolution because I strongly oppose the mention of delayed ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon , which is an insult to the Irish population 's rejection of the Treaty .
I believe that the EU does not have competence in this area ; nor should it have .
The list includes a lot of well-intentioned , large and heavy presents .
We have no influence on what the Sun does .
To put it another way : what can the Commission realistically do to make all 6 billion people on this Earth use fewer resources , not in the future but right here and now ?
That would mean that it would be possible for him to stand trial in Poland just like any other citizen .
We have a great deal of sympathy for Mr Siwiec and we agree , for what it is worth , that the case that has been launched against him is unfounded and politically motivated .
If , however , we believe that it should be possible for him to be tried in a court of law like everyone else , this is because we must have confidence that Poland respects the basic principles of democracy and the rule of law that are a precondition of being a Member State of the European Union .
Madam President , I would like to start by thanking Mr Surján for his sterling work in keeping the different elements of this budget process together .
That is true , but there is no public budget more controlled than the EU budget .
We support the draft budget put forward by Mr Surján .
That is also the way we want to see the EU budget go in future - in other words , that we should concentrate on these areas .
It is appalling that we have to see this acted out time after time when expenditure can be indicated but no decent funding can be found for it .
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe also supports the proposal to allocate EUR 300 million to a dairy fund to cushion the current crisis for dairy producers .
We share the view that the crisis is serious and must be tackled .
Personally , I am not a supporter of the new fund as the Commission does already have tools to help the industry and has also earmarked nearly EUR 0.5 billion for the purpose .
