experts gave their views .
The problem is two-fold .
I should like here to comment in particular on the fact that chemical substances are used not only by professional athletes , but also by a large number of amateurs .
It would also be advisable if widely available preparations carried labels stating that they were anabolic substances .
Ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , today we are calling on the European Commission to take immediate action to ensure that the present situation improves quickly .     – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the initiative by the European Parliament , as expressed in the motion for a resolution on doping by the Committee on Culture and Education , is an important step forward and a direct plea to all the jointly responsible agencies to combat this phenomenon in a more substantive and effective manner .
May I remind you that turnover from the trade in anabolic substances exceeds two billion euros per annum in Europe and approximately six billion euros per annum in the entire world .
The European Commission must step up its cooperation with the competent organisations and support a mechanism for combating the problem , which will include the necessary research , proper information , education and the promotion of clean sport , with the objective of protecting public health and defending athletic ideals .
When a sports team is a business , winning at all costs becomes for the athlete and the team what the market demands in order to advertise and sell the products of the business groups , in other words in order to increase their profits .
In our view , sport is a social commodity and cannot be subject to the profit rationale .
The draft UNESCO Convention follows on from the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity made by UNESCO in November 2002 , which was a positive step towards international cooperation but which has proved to be an inadequate response to threats to cultural diversity today from the intense globalisation of the market in cultural goods and services .
We all hope that it will constitute a binding standard-setting instrument for the protection of cultural diversity .
That is why we need to resist pressure from these few but strong countries , so that the final text of the Convention clearly underlines the right of States Parties to develop , maintain and implement policies and laws designed to promote and protect cultural diversity and media pluralism .
That is why we are insisting that the European Union and its Member States should do nothing during the process of the negotiation and conclusion of the Convention in question to compromise cultural diversity or undermine the ability of governments to support cultural diversity .
Could the Commission please give us detailed updates on the various positions formulated within the framework of the negotiations ?     . – The European Parliament resolution on the western Balkans expresses the more general move of the USA and the EU towards new border changes , the competition between them to divide up the area and the EU 's attempts to annex it to Euro-transatlantic structures .
Consequently , Greece as a country , its people , and the other peoples are not safeguarded under any Euro-transatlantic agreements .
That is why we are calling for the granting of immediate emergency aid , which will guarantee satisfactory distribution of food and of the food distribution teams needed , without overlooking the need for proper shelter and education .
The global dimension of the causes and extent and of the methods for dealing with numerous problems is no longer in dispute .
Basically , there is no health policy .
Responsibility for the protection of health is being individualised and the healthcare services market is being fully liberalised , following the sweeping changes in industrial relations and in social insurance , such as the organisation of working times , the increase in the retirement age , the reduction in pensions and so on .
Mr President , I agree with almost everything Mrs Doyle said and I should like to say that , with the entry into force of the Stockholm Convention , twelve of the most dangerous substances in the world will gradually be abolished .
Nonetheless , if this Convention is to come up to our expectations , it must be applied correctly and must gather momentum by including new substances as time goes by .
Of course , if we are to succeed , the Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee must first be set up , so that it can start examining new proposals for the addition of other organic pollutants to the list .
However , the first conference must find ways to help limit the reliance on DDT , such as by promoting research into alternative means and providing technical and financial support .
With regard to point 9 of the resolution , I think that it is the Commission 's duty to include Members of the European Parliament in this sort of delegation and may I say that , from my own personal experience , we have cooperated excellently in two instances , once in Buenos Aires and once at the conference on sustainable development in New York last week which was also attended by Members of the European Parliament , where we managed through exchanges not only of views , but also of advice , opinions and , in particular , political judgments on certain issues , to promote the issues to which these conferences were devoted .
Mr President , I should like to start by thanking the European Parliament , and especially the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety and the rapporteur , Mrs Klaß , for their contribution to this report at first reading .
Nonetheless , there are still some gaps
