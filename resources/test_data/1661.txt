Unselfishly and without discrimination , they helped all the victims , irrespective of their culture or religion or the colour of their skin .
Let us make use of this feeling of solidarity in order to choose better priorities in future .
Large and wealthy powers are prepared to conduct wars , including nuclear wars , at a couple of minutes ’ notice .
Let us learn our lesson one day .     Mr President , the tsunami disaster in the Indian Ocean is in many ways a turning point in the history of the modern world .
I nonetheless feel uncomfortable about the fact that , in this case , the EU seems mainly to be interested in promoting its own stances in connection with this tragedy which , upon examination , reveals that what are needed are warning systems , not the EU.
What task remains ?
What needs right now to be focused upon are the emergency efforts to relieve human suffering , take care of the injured , identify the dead , be available to the grieving , and facilitate and support the reconstruction .
If emergency services are to operate effectively , there has to be an international organisation whose national components have taken part in frequent joint exercises and that operates in crises caused by , for example , earthquakes , floods or terrorist attacks .
What is important is that it have a permanent structure and be given responsibility in the following areas : analysing – and making plans in response to – the need for future emergency efforts ; planning and implementing common exercises ; and coordinating and mobilising resources for evacuation , medical care and the transport of food , medicines , clothes and other aid materials in the crisis situation .
Historically , the problem is that , generally speaking , too little attention has been given to the readiness to respond to disasters .
It is relatively simple to mobilise large amounts of money both from the general public and from governments in an emergency situation .
Nothing has been done by the governments concerned or by various donors .
EU activity should be more coordinated specifically in this area .
A far better coordinated EU – and I am talking here about the Commission and the Member States – could have been of great help at the height of the disaster .
If rapidity of response requires the use of already appropriated resources , we should ensure that these are subsequently and appropriately replenished .
In the reconstruction , it is vitally important to take account of the environment if the necessary conditions of life are not to be further eroded and if the risk of further disasters is to be reduced .     Mr President , the EU and the United States have many values in common .
These are important issues for the EU and our citizens , and they are always on the agenda in discussions with the United States .
This is a sphere in which the EU and the United States can together play an important role .
It was good to hear of Luxembourg’s ambitions , even if the Presidency does not have its earphones on at the present moment .
A number of factual matters have been mentioned , as well as the matters of how we are to set up a free trade area and a Transatlantic Parliamentary Assembly .
We share the concern it expresses for effects on the environment .
We do however take a critical view of quite a few of the wordings in the resolution .
We do not believe that the European Parliament should call upon those countries that have still not ratified the Kyoto Protocol to do so .
We believe that individual Member States should have the right to determine their national positions themselves and to put these forward in international negotiations .
The resources must be found within the existing framework for the EU’s total budget .
We have nonetheless chosen to abstain in the vote on the resolution as a whole because it is , in general , aimed at strengthening the EU as a global actor in relation to the United States and the rest of the world .     We are well disposed towards different forms of international aid to developing countries .
For the above-mentioned reasons , we have chosen to vote against the motion for a resolution .     I voted against the resolution on the grounds that it does not even achieve the objectives stated by the Presidency .
The presidential election in Palestine was also made more difficult by large groups ’ wanting to sabotage the election and , by extension , the democratic process .
What , finally , are missing are a condemnation of all terrorist acts , including suicide attacks carried out in the Gaza Strip , and an expression by the European Parliament of its deep sympathy for the victims ’ families .     The June List supports the peace process in the Middle East and hopes that the parties can soon agree on the Roadmap for Peace .
Even if we essentially support the main thrust of the resolution , we do not believe that the EU’s role within foreign and security policy should be extended .
The resolution points out the need for such action in a clear and elucidatory way .
It also has more members than the EU and is , in that sense , more pan-European .
It must instead sign a humanitarian agreement with FARC in line with the Geneva Convention so that Ingrid and 3 000 other prisoners can be released .
Was any listening done in Davos , however ?
Perhaps from a theoretical European perspective it is possible to believe that free trade , capitalism and liberalisation constitute the solution to development problems .
We must stop demanding
