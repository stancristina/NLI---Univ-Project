If it were a case of the supervisory authorities ’ access to these systems helping to prevent crime in this area , it would be worth thinking about .
Even if that were so , however , there are such major reasons for concern about extending the access in question that we in our group shall vote against the proposal , irrespective of the fact that we very much appreciate the rapporteur’s very commendable efforts to have an obligation imposed to report on whether the system is of any use .
That is something it may , in some places , achieve , moreover , by means of limit values on the quantity of , for example , spray pesticides in the water .
For us , it therefore seems wrong to allow poison in groundwater .
We must react as soon as we can measure the fact that a pesticide or its breakdown product has penetrated the root zone of the earth’s crust .
When we can measure the pesticides and their breakdown products in the water , it was a mistake to have approved them , and they must immediately cease to be used .
This shows that , despite the Constitution’s talk of a high level of protection , the most stringent protection can be removed .
Groundwater is , of course , one area in which special rules in Denmark can be justified , because we drink non-purified groundwater .
Not even in the light of this will it , however , be accepted that we are entitled to special consideration .
How are we supposed to prove that Danes are more vulnerable than Germans to , for example , allergy-producing and carcinogenic substances .
If this amendment cannot be adopted , I would call upon the Commission to declare that countries in which non-purified groundwater is drunk directly can introduce a higher level of protection .
Anyone who does not comply with this regulation in Article 213 can be dismissed or made to forfeit his or her pension rights or other similar benefits .
That does not mean that they do not also have to behave with integrity during their terms of office .
It amounts to misplaced interference in the conditions of the labour market , and it is not surprising that the two sides of industry have rejected the directive .
The European Parliament clearly wants to see low growth .
This has produced good results .
Firstly , we have a larger proportion of the population of working age in the labour market than any other EU country .
We do not have the strikes we see again and again in Belgium and France .
It is incredible that we should have to put up with a situation in which the EU , which has not been able to solve these problems nearly so well as ourselves , is to tell us what to do .
It is quite impossible to assess how hard a nation works by looking at the length of its working time .
In Denmark , people work efficiently , so the country can manage with shorter working hours .
The opt-out from the 48-hour week must finally be removed .
The opt-out makes no contribution to a social Europe .
That is not the way forward for Europe .
We cannot and must not compete in terms of either low wages or long working days .
Europe’s populations must feel that the European Union has their interests at heart .
A 48-hour working week which had better definitions of working time and recreational time and which called on companies to take account of workers ’ family lives , would increase employees ’ options .
I really feel that they focused upon what is fundamentally needed .
Instead , they have unfortunately moved in the wrong direction in most areas .
The World Bank does not operate as well as it could .
I completely support Mr Almunia’s emphasis on the fact that Europe can speak with one voice , and I would propose four tasks for consideration that I believe are urgent .
If we do so , we shall have 27.98 % of the votes , compared with the United States with 16.39 % .
At present , the European country with the most substantial share of the votes after the United States is Germany , with 4.49 % .
I am not talking about a new conflict of interests ; I am talking about a far better balance in the World Bank and about our needing , as the second task , to ask for a reform of its lending rules and conditions and , indeed , to insist that this takes place .
In that way , our efforts will be along the same lines , rather than overlap .
We need now really to stop making the same demands of poor countries as we make of rich ones and to help construct healthy and strong states in the developing countries which can then embrace the right to share the ownership of development policy .
May I conclude by concurring with Mr Almunia and Mr Schmit in saying how important I believe it is for Europe now also to assume the genuine responsibility stemming from the fact that we are the world’s largest organisation providing aid to developing countries .
When Mr Farage raised the matter , I asked for a list of all gifts in excess of EUR 100 .
Last Sunday , I asked Eva Joly – the examining magistrate who has got business people and politicians into prison for corruption – about where the dividing line is between gifts and corruption . ‘EUR 120 ,’ she said .
I want to know who gets what from whom and I want to be able to check whether consideration is provided .
Matters got off to a good start with Barroso .
He gave us a list of 3 000 working
