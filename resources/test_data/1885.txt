A sea change away from the EU 's current policies is therefore needed .
Large-scale illegal fishing damages marine ecosystems , increases the cost of fishing , and reduces the incomes of people who fish legally and who comply with the rules on preserving fisheries resources .
Given that illegal fishing has its biggest impact on those parts of the fleet operating on the high seas and on the continental shelf , especially in the least developed countries , cooperation among the Member States and among international fishing organisations is vital if this kind of fishing is to be combated .
Third country vessels operating in the exclusive economic zones of the Member States must be subject to the rules of the common fisheries policy and to existing national requirements .
Given that the EU is the world 's biggest producer and consumer of wine and that the sector accounts for 60 % of the EU 's exports , I feel that there should be far-reaching reform of the current common organisation of the market in wine , which would help consolidate traditional markets and develop expanding markets .
The report contains a sensible analysis of the Commission 's proposals and presents a range of most timely suggestions .
These are measures aimed at reducing the EU 's vineyards , which would affect primarily the least developed regions , family holdings and farmers on low incomes , but they will have little impact on the rise in imports and the declining role of winemaking in the EU Member States .
That alone is not enough , however .
The purpose of the report before us is to square the circle - to tackle the economic and social problems faced by the Union whilst developing the existing economic policies and instruments that lie at the root of those problems .

Unlike the oil crises of the 1970s , which were caused by a breakdown in supplies , the current 'crisis ' has arisen , on the one hand , from increased demand on the part of developing countries such as China and India , and of the biggest consumer in the world , the United States , and , on the other , from predictions that this 'finite ' resource will be in short supply in the medium term .
Fuel prices have hit the fisheries sector particularly badly .
Until such time as that fund is put in place , the fishing businesses affected must be granted some form of temporary compensation .
The European energy supply crisis can only be mitigated effectively by means of a global EU strategy aimed at the gradual reduction in oil dependency , the development and production of alternative fuels , including looking into the nuclear option , and innovative solutions to managing transport systems as a whole . on behalf of the PPE-DE Group . - ( PT ) Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the marketing of the meat of bovine animals aged 12 months or less was in need of clarification , and so I should first of all like to praise the Commission 's proposal .
This and other aspects of the draft regulation were improved by amendments adopted in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and included in the report that we are debating here .
This should enable the Member States to make better use of the available data for drawing up statistics that , as far as possible , comply with harmonised definitions .
Cooperation between Member States and third countries is already happening .
The Convention incorporates all existing conventions and recommendations on maritime labour adopted by the ILO since 1919 into a single text to serve as a basis for the first universal Maritime Labour Code .
It is now up to the Member States to ratify this Convention .
The can of worms opened up by the directive on creating the internal market for services ( the notorious Bolkestein Directive ) , paving the way for attacks on public services , is developed further in this report on social services of general interest ( SSGIs ) .
The EU stands to gain nothing from a rigid model for defining economic activities and for determining their public or private nature .
Accordingly , I am in favour of much of what the report before us contains .
The advantages of concluding multilateral agreements are well documented .
Those proposals were as follows : insists 'on a peaceful political settlement to the dispute over Iran 's nuclear programmes ' and 'reaffirms its opposition to any military action or threat of use of force ' ; 'expresses its opposition to the deployment of new ballistic and anti-ballistic missile systems on the territory of the Member States of the European Union' ; and calls on 'States with nuclear weapons to pull their arsenals back from a state of high alert and to undertake not to attack non-nuclear countries with nuclear weapons ' .

It was silent on the unacceptable , wait-and-see and follow-my-leader attitude of the EU , which still continues to make the re-establishment of relations with the Palestinian authorities , including the recommencement of financial support , dependent on their meeting certain
