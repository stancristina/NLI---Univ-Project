look like DNA diagrams .
Mr President , the Commission proposal misleadingly confines itself to an administrative matter which does not even merit discussion and deliberately overlooks the way in which direct Community aid is distributed to farm holdings and the worsening situation of small farm holdings .
According to the scant information contained in the report and from the farm accounting data network , 23.2 % of the farms in the network are paid less than EUR 1 000 per annum in direct aid .
As a result , 20 % of the large farm holdings in the European Union receive 80 % of Community subsidies , as the former Commissioner , Mr MacSharry discovered to his surprise and , unfortunately , the situation is getting worse .
I therefore call on you to intervene .
They personally agreed to this name at the United Nations .
However , they are property rights sui generis because they indirectly recognise the importance of aesthetic values while , at the same time , awarding artists a sort of honorary tax .
But these messages cannot be disseminated without artists .
That is why it is wrong that artists in certain countries do not recognise this right .
Everyone stands to gain from this solution .
We are all aware of the importance of this sector , of which previous speakers have painted a dramatic picture .
That programmes and aid which are about to expire be extended and that urgent , effective support be given to Community producers and ways be found of supporting producers , especially in the present economic climate .
So I too am adamant .
We must vote in favour of this motion for a resolution and we want the Commission to respond to this concern on our part .
This was one of the matters discussed at our committee meeting last week ; it is a matter which has concerned the European Parliament for a very long time and we , the committee , had intended to put an oral question to the Commissioner .
There have been some developments , which the Commissioner has described for us and on which I should like to comment .
And I trust that the United States will take the same approach and speak with one voice and not several voices as has been the case in the past .
Otherwise circumstances will force us , the European Parliament , to take unilateral action and adopt solutions already adopted by the European Parliament .
Mr President , the GÃ¶teborg Summit was the first summit in the history of the European Union at which top priority was given to safeguarding the sustainability and viability of the social economic development model .
I say "might " because no specific concomitant measures on pollution management costs aimed at individuals or companies were adopted .
So the summit clearly failed to come up to expectations and consequently I would not say that it was a landmark summit .
Mr President , Mr President of the European Central Bank , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , today we are debating the exceptional report by Mrs Randzio-Plath on the annual report of the European Central Bank .
The European Central Bank and other central banks throughout the world are under a great deal of pressure to relax their monetary policy .
You must be guided , Mr President , by principles of monetary stability and economic development , as laid out in the Treaty .
Mr President , allow me to start by congratulating the Commissioner , although it would appear that I am not alone as the large majority wishes to do likewise .
The point is : with Article 140 talking of a high level of protection , what can reform mean if it does not maintain a high level of protection ?
But have you checked if this complementarity can be applied to the entire pyramid of workers , and especially to small and medium-sized enterprises and low incomes , or do we need to take a different approach here ?
Secondly , as the objective is not just sustainable pensions , but decent sustainable pensions , should we not look at what margins will be earmarked for pensions from increases in the gross domestic product ?
Of course , one of these objectives is the one you referred to , i .e . the inter-generational balance .
If what you meant was that some of these objectives should be included in the guidelines on employment , I should tell you that the first cycle of the employment strategy will end next year during the Spanish presidency , when the five-year period expires .
And , of course , there is always a link between an increase in the gross national product and support for the first pillar , subject to the principles governing the stability and growth pact .
But I think that the very fact that this discussion has started at European level and that we have agreed to work together on this problem , which now has European dimensions , is important from the point of view of public awareness .
So what we are trying to do is to support the national structures so that they operate to the same standards .
I refer , of course , to the example of Denmark .
The common objectives are sustainable pensions , the financial sustainability of pensions , both state and private , and the modernisation of pensions , as I set out in my initial intervention .
I should just like to correct your last finding : I do not foresee any deterioration in the situation and , may I say , nor do I wish for one .
At the same time , there are absolutely no data concerning Greece in all the statistics on the Union .
This was the thrust of my question
