to be back in the House .
This is sound practice and should provide greater transparency .
The second element entailed examination of a sample of transactions and payments for each area of expenditure .
I would urge caution concerning the timetable .
The Court noted an improvement in the controls on structural measures .
Traditional own resources such as customs and agricultural duties have fallen by 23 % compared with the previous year .
Consequently , the financial year 2002 closed with more than EUR 66 000 million in outstanding commitments known in French as the RAL .
This report will prove very useful throughout the whole budgetary cycle .
The Court has paid particular attention to analysing the degree to which internal control standards have been put in place .
Stronger control by the Member States is needed to improve management of European funds .
They should also provide a clearer description of the shortcomings noted .
It will no doubt require adjustment and amendment .
It is essential to ensure that the plans are implemented .
If that were to happen , the Court would be deprived of the independence it needs in order to discharge its obligations .
I should like to focus on specific issues in that report .
Shortcomings in the implementation of pre-accession instruments are also detailed .
It represents an obstacle to effective implementation of Community programmes .
A more careful study must also be made of how it stands at present , of its possible shortcomings and of appropriate changes , should any prove necessary .
As I conclude , I should also like to mention that bringing the European Development Fund under the Commission ’s control and management would be a significant step forward .
In my view it should also be stressed that this is a transitional report , insofar as it is part of the ongoing reform of the Commission , which is a significant administrative reform .
The estimates may prove overly optimistic .
Nonetheless , the Court has considered programmes implemented by Eurostat in the context of other audits .
In addition , OLAF launched an internal investigation into Eurostat in mid-2000 .
It depends on how complex or extensive it is .
I believe we are on the right track .
I simply mention it so that the House is not disappointed if it should turn out that the reform is not fully complete by 2005 .
The clear conclusion to be drawn from this situation is the urgency of pursuing the reform and concluding it at the earliest opportunity .
That would be the best way of reaching an understanding .
My response on this is also directed to Mr Sørensen .
It should also be borne in mind that 80 % of the Community budget goes through the national budgets .
There is the Anglo-Saxon system and the European system .
Thank you for your attention .
Nevertheless , the advantages of this European health card are obvious .
Administrative simplification is very important , as other Members have pointed out , but I would also take this opportunity to say that for the first time we are modifying the old Regulation ( EEC ) No 1408/71 and we are beginning to talk not just about the free movement of workers in Europe , but also the free movement of citizens , and we are beginning to organise a discussion and political practice in which the right to European citizenship begins to become a reality in relation to such fundamental elements as the right to health .
This programme , directed at countries in which immigration originates and transit countries in order to help them to manage migratory flows , is essential and deserves our support .
For the Spanish nationalists , political dialogue in the Basque country is unacceptable because , as they say , it would mean agreeing with the will of ETA.
Mr Gorostiaga , your approach is totally out of line with what we in this House defend : freedom of expression , which you do not defend in any of your considerations and even less in your speech this afternoon .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , please believe me when I say that I am not particularly interested in stirring up past issues .
Ultimately , by not regulating the section relating to the neutrality obligation and consequently allowing the legislations of the Member States to regulate , by means of handy subsidiarity , issues relating to the prohibition or non-prohibition of defensive measures .
As has rightly been said , we are dealing with a really important Directive .
Finally , with regard to the time period during which a company can be held responsible , I believe that the 30 years laid down in the common position is an excessive period .
With regard to the issue of financial guarantees , I believe that it improves the Commission ’s proposal – which did not provide for them – but that it has not been either as ambitious as initially hoped or as concrete as it could have been .
I say this with particular feeling , because my country was always in the vanguard of European integration and now it is in the rearguard .
I have been particularly struck by the fact that you have been especially critical of the current situation in the economic field and this is understandable .
The important thing now is to complete a Magna Carta , which is absolutely essential for our future and also for enlargement .     Mr President , we have just seen a spectacular failure in European integration on the part of the Heads of State or Government , who have not been sufficiently statesmanlike to see and preserve the collective interests of all the citizens .
All of this acquis , the fruit of negotiation – as Mr Berlusconi has said – must be recovered and consolidated as an approved text .
