to Community legislation , would the Commission be prepared to cofinance such a project , in order to prevent the economic losses which the region of Asturias could face by dismantling the existing pylons ?     .  Mr President , Commissioner , Council representatives , I shall devote the first part of the time available to me to speaking on behalf of Mrs Rodríguez Ramos , who is unable to be here as planned to defend her report on cotton .
Your final objective is actually complete decoupling .
Regulation (EC )  No 1783/1999 prevents them from planting fruit or vegetables .
By way of example I could mention Andalusia , an Objective 1 region where serious social concerns exist .
Your reasoning was inappropriate and misleading , and you presented arguments we all recognise as hypocritical .
The livelihoods of the tobacco producers are at stake .
All sides in this House have striven to come up with a reasonable , just and fair solution .
Decoupling aid will result in reduced production .
The situation of the economy in general is precarious too , and the prospects for jobs bleak .
To date , resources were allocated to these crops with clear objectives in mind .
In the case of other cereal crops , the option of keeping a percentage of aid coupled to production has been retained .
I suggest that only the dishonest ones stand to gain from this Commission proposal .
Consequently , there is no valid reason to curtail the development of this sector .
It is worth stating , however , that the reserve will be used not only for this particular purpose but also to deal with other potential shortfalls in any one of the sectors reformed .
The studies make it quite clear that the quota allocated to Spain falls far short of actual production .
Producer countries should therefore be allowed to designate a transitional period before the new reforms come into force .
It represents a useful reference point facilitating full implementation of CAP reform .
I beg you , Commissioner , not to now give the region the through your proposal , which would turn the 2 000 families dependent on tobacco off the land .     Mr President , Commissioner , we are concerned with the interim reform of the CAP for three major sectors that are particularly important to the Mediterranean area .
Olive oil production is no exception .
That is a difference of almost 500 % .
It is part of daily life out in the real world .
Due to the penalties imposed pursuant to the 2001 cotton reform , the area under cotton in Spain has already suffered a 20 % reduction .
I can provide some specific instances drawn from Spain .
It is the leading producer of tobacco in Spain .
For the weak , unattainable .
In this regard , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I would like to express the support of my group – and specifically my Party – in order to unblock the situation in my country , in order to replace the cat-fighting method with constructive debate .
Parliament had repeatedly argued that we needed responsible economic governance .
In any event , however , there is a fundamental point : given the European political landscape , no party is going to have a hegemony and , if we apply parliamentary thinking when it comes to proposing the President of the Commission , we must be consistent .
As we all know , this does not mean that there are no more obstacles to overcome , but it is encouraging that those obstacles have been identified and that the Romanian authorities have taken measures to remove them .
It highlights the need for that country to make progress in compliance with the law and to combat corruption , as well as the need to strengthen the rule of law and respect for minorities .
Our intention in this case is that the maps showing routes should become reality within our European geography .
But that is nothing more than the really essential part , the tip of the iceberg , because we must remember that the total cost of the projects for the trans-European networks for the Union of 27 States is more than 600 000 million .
In other words , the ultimate objective is to establish single and coordinated evaluation procedures between two States , which will enable border areas to make simultaneous progress and , where necessary , the border regions to be better coordinated .
This would really contribute to development , and not restrictive measures such as the quick start list .
In line with this thinking , nevertheless , we cannot understand why , in certain passages , specific reference to the Iberian Peninsula ( Spain and Portugal ) is being removed in connections with the North Sea and the Irish Sea .
I hope that you , who I know offer enormous support to the project , can resolve this problem I am faced with .     Mr President , Commissioner , we are at first reading , not at ‘second first reading’ , and I must say to you , as rapporteur for the report on the White Paper , that the project you are presenting to us is organised and is in line with those recommendations .
I also told them that it was not a question of substantially modifying Annex III nor all the projects , but of allowing Parliament its prerogatives , that is to say , the capacity to make contributions to the proposals for the trans-European networks .
Other amendments have been rejected because they go beyond the scope of the proposed Decision ; for example , Amendments Nos 2 and 13 ( second part ) .
The economic conditions are specified in the financial Regulation and not in this document .
