We would be happy to vote .
However , as the Commissioner for the budget , I am bound to say that a solution must be found which does not affect the budget .
Madam President , my colleague Mr Fischler made a statement on this yesterday .
The 50 tonne per annum limitation would exclude many Member States from cultivation in advance .
If we are to be able to make a real appraisal of the BSE situation in the Member States , we must make it clear that fallen stock are also to be tested for human health safety in a screening process .
Allow me to repeat quite clearly : the repercussions on the Member States have obviously been overestimated by some members in the House .
Nonetheless , I must ensure that this level of safety also applies to Italy , Germany and all the other countries in the European Union .
One does not exclude the other .
When Mr Patten says in his presentation that either the Commission programme is accepted or we must make cuts , I find that highly displeasing .
I am curious to know how it helps if I tell you that this figure is 21334 or 21425 .
The screening process has therefore been completed with all candidates .
There have been intensive discussions on this over recent weeks and months .
Mr President , to be honest , the underlying question was how many legal acts does the European Union have .
It is not a problem for the other thirteen which is why I cannot predict exactly how this issue will be handled in the final stage of negotiations .
Mr President , Commissioner , trust is good , control is even better , as the Head of State of a now defunct system used to say .
Mr President , I hope that the two members due to speak before me were not travelling by train and have been delayed .
We need uniform electrification , especially in relation to voltage and frequency .
I am delighted that we have succeeded with the rapporteur and numerous other members in finding a good , common line on most aspects of this very demanding subject and would like to thank them for that .
I hope that the Council will do so and I call on it to act responsibly .
We always look spellbound at America , at the United States , where industry and , of course , the free market economy are also promoted by the state .
First , liberalisation of the railway networks in the Member States and the establishment of a common market for railway services is addressed from the point of view of free access and transit rights for the infrastructures of the Member States in cross-border traffic , especially freight traffic .
The prospects for high-speed trains are somewhat more encouraging , although here too , not everything in the garden is rosy .
Mr President , Commissioner , we and the rapporteur , Mr Savary , have gone a long way towards accommodating the Council by including umpteen proposed amendments here in plenary in order to reconcile the two versions .
The second important cornerstone of the social market economy is the stability of the currency .
We know that public investment can boost growth and employment as well .
In addition to launching a technical offensive in economic terms within the Union , for example , by setting up highways of information and focusing on research and development expenditure , it is of paramount importance to step up investment by approximately 10 % , so as to secure growth and bring unemployment levels down .
On the other hand , there is no reference whatsoever to the fair distribution of available gainful employment , the realisation of a modern , third economic sector for social , cultural and environmental services , regionalisation of economic cycles , demand-orientated policy , or even the content of a knowledge-based society in social , educational policy and cultural terms .
That is the key concept : a knowledge-based economy in which each and every individual is able to develop his or her talents .
We also adopted the convergence reports in April of that year , and held the accession debate in May .
We will also keep an eye out for overly optimistic data being submitted in this regard .
The Member States ' efforts to overhaul their budgets will only prove successful if there is a clear reduction in the taxation and social contribution burden within the EU.
I say this because substantial structural reform and continuous budgetary surpluses are required under the terms of the Stability and Growth Pact , so as to gradually reduce the public debt ratio to 60 % .
But I would also like to ask you once again to consider that the examination of other States ' stability programmes that took place last year also gave rise to criticism .
This was achieved in the first few months of the euro zone ' s existence .
We have some weighing up to do here .
Mrs Randzio-Plath has once again stressed the importance of sustainability in the context of compliance with the convergence criteria .
It certainly is not privatisation in the real sense .
No stone was left unturned in order to attain this objective , which begs the question as to whether the currency stability that has now been achieved can be secured in the long term or , put another way : how do matters actually stand on the sustainability front ?
However , this is the first accession to the euro zone .
As such , the possibility exists that cross-subsidies are provided , and also that complaints about cross-subsidies will ensue .
In this respect , there should be another reference in the text of the directive to the Amsterdam Protocol , because this established that it
