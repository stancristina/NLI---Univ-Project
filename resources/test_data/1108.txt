I think it is crucial that it is clearly stated that we have three options .
The rules will now also include a very important distinction between a technical postponement and a political postponement , where the reason must be clearly stated , as well as a clear distinction between the technical closing of the accounts and a political decision on whether or not we can adopt the accounts .
One thing which is clear is that in December we chose to activate the rules concerning Parliament 's role as the discharging authority .
And as a follow-up to the extensive discussions which accompanied that , it is crucial that we now have some clear rules on how we should act in a similar situation to the one we saw before .
Hopefully , the forthcoming election campaign will also deal with other important political issues , but the battle over the major reforms should be fought now , while the political will is still present .
We have achieved a really good result .
The Office will now be located in the Commission for organisational purposes , but it will be entirely independent as far as carrying out investigations is concerned .
The Office will also have powers to investigate irregularities and fraud in other EU institutions .
The Office will have full access to all relevant information , and it will be able to carry out investigations on its own initiative .
With this proposal , we will hopefully get the best of all worlds .
We will get an Office which is independent , and at the same time gain an extra benefit by locating the Office within the Commission .
We will not have an Office which is hoodwinked , as we have been in Parliament for years .
We cannot wait for that .
By adopting this proposal , we will set up the legal framework .
Money must now be made available in the budget for staff .
The Office must have the resources to operate effectively .
When Parliament meets again in the autumn , we shall ensure that sufficient funds are earmarked in the budget .
We have a huge task here .
The whole question of what the Office needs cannot be left to the Commission .
We can then quickly discuss the appointment of the Supervisory Committee , and then we can elect a Director .
That is what we need .
Mr President , the new UCLAF - OLAF - is intended to put an end to irregularities , nepotism , corruption and fraud in the EU.
I think it is crucial for us now to have an investigation office which can investigate circumstances in all the EU institutions .
When I say all the EU institutions , that should also include the European Investment Bank , for example .
But the European Parliament should also offer its assistance , and there may be examples of tasks which it would be interesting to have investigated , such as the problems surrounding our premises , where there are still a large number of unanswered questions .
I therefore believe , Mr President , that the new office , OLAF , is a significant improvement of the situation in the EU.
It gives us a good chance to clear things up and to ensure openness and transparency in all the institutions .
Mr President , it has been a difficult task for the rapporteur , Mr Brinkhorst , and for the Committee on Budgetary Control to work on the 1997 discharge , because there has been no 'proper ' Commission with which to discuss the discharge for 1997 .
Obviously , in such a situation we cannot give a discharge .
There has still been no reform of staff policy and still no improvement has been made in the administration of the various programmes .
We need a better structure , a better administration and greater transparency .
This means that we cannot simply decide anything we like .
It also means that consumers expect food to be of decent quality , but above all , consumers expect and demand that food should not be damaging to health .
The situation may not be all that good here , but it is still better than in many other places .
As has already been said , this dispute concerns , amongst other things , meat treated with hormones , and in this case it is quite clear , as has been emphasised here , that we should put consumer interests first .
You must not gamble with people 's health .
The problem is that it is very difficult to turn the WTO into the champion of consumer interests .
There is no reason to expect free trade to solve every problem .
We therefore need to get some more politics into the WTO .
In the long term we will also have to require the Commission , when negotiating these WTO agreements , to put consumer interests and environmental considerations before concern for the sacred free market .
You need to understand that in the Commission .
It is not good enough to consider only the free market , because then consumers lose out , as we have seen in this case .
We have no need of a new President at present .
Firstly , we should remove the present Commission , because the Commissioners have been deemed to be collectively irresponsible .
That is what the Committee of Experts did .
Secondly , we should call the officials responsible to account .
Those who have contributed to corruption and fraud must be subjected to disciplinary proceedings .
Those who have covered things up must be suspended , because it has to be worse to cover up corruption than to provide information about corruption , as Mr van Buitenen did , with suspension and salary deductions as a result
