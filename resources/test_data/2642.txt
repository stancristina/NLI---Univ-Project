Madam President , Commissioner Å pidla , I would like to start by thanking the Commissioner for his response and the committee for its initiative .
It is scandalous that children are left to live on their own at all .
An impact assessment is an urgent and necessary requirement .
We must include the parties concerned and NGOs and we must come up with proposals .
Otherwise , we will be forced to feel ashamed when we face the next generation .
I would like to say something to the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats here in Parliament .
It is these governments that are failing to act , these governments that are demonstrating a lack of coordination and a lack of solidarity .
Now it is a matter of jobs , of the social security systems and of the public sector .
We cannot wait until the summit in May .
This constitutes support precisely for strengthening the rights of users and consumers .
This will be an important basis for the monitoring of civil rights .
They have not looked critically at what technical progress could bring if we do not pay attention .
The authorities in Sweden now have the right to monitor Internet traffic without there being either a suspicion of crime or any risk to the safety of individuals or society .
I assume that protection of our fundamental rights as per this report will also receive support when we take a decision on the telecom package .
Citizens who do not normally have access to the discussion forums of the large-scale media can stir up opinion and pursue issues .
It has brought about increased knowledge .
The Internet is therefore an important factor in our democratic society today and so should it remain .
It is a democratic right to be able to express different political views .
In this regard we follow the Council of Europe Convention on the protection of children against sexual exploitation and sexual abuse .
Other groups have also been affected .
In this context I would like to remind my fellow Members of the fact that they can support a written declaration that is seeking to put a stop to this violence , and that is Written Declaration No 94.
The security services of various countries have traded the personal data that they have obtained by monitoring the Internet .
To believe that a decree from Brussels or Strasbourg could change that is quite incredible and very detached from reality .
That is a bit rich when we know that the right or opportunity to attend school is not a foregone conclusion in many EU countries .
Here we are urged to apply common criminal measures to protect intellectual property rights .
Mr President , the internal market is the EU 's absolute greatest contribution to freedom and prosperity in Europe .
Mr Lehne 's report indicates , to some extent unintentionally , the problems and the risks involved .
This is also wishful thinking .
The principle is quite simply not taken seriously .
It requires the crime to have been established in court , after which res judicata would presumably have to apply , even in the context of an individual claim , so that judgments relating to a single case cannot be revisited .
This will result in the subjective handling of important business information , which can be misused .
There are far too many risks and points that are unclear at this stage .
This is laid down in one of the first paragraphs of Mr Takkula 's own-initiative report on educating the children of migrants .
I vote in favour of a slimmer but more focused EU.
The principle of subsidiarity requires that this issue be dealt with by the Member States themselves .
We share the rapporteur 's view that the poor transposition of this directive in some Member States should generally be viewed as disappointing and we urge the Member States to implement Directive 2004/38/EC in its entirety , so that the right to free movement can become a reality .
The delegation of Swedish Conservatives in the European Parliament has today voted in favour of Urszula Gacek 's ( PPE-DE , PL) report on the problems and prospects of European citizenship .
We need to strengthen European citizenship because it is the central plank of freedom of movement .
Poor control and inadequate follow-up of the resources granted every year as part of the EU funds ' projects have resulted in significant amounts of money going into the wrong pockets .
That is regrettable , but hardly surprising .
For me , it is very important that no one should be discriminated against on the grounds of disability .
The amendments , especially those by the Union for Europe of the Nations Group , are also praiseworthy , but , for editorial reasons , not everything that has been proposed can be included in the text of the resolution .
Culture is a political area which falls under the political responsibility of individual Member States .
This resolution discusses issues which lie outside the European Union 's competence .
' Member States are responsible for the organisation , content and reform of school education ' .
Unfortunately , Mr Schmitt 's resolution fails to keep its introductory promise .
I therefore voted against both the own-initiative report and the alternative resolution .
It goes without saying that we voted against the report .
The budget and the number of staff have also increased .
Staff numbers have increased just as dramatically .
It also places higher demands on us when discussing discharge , requiring us to spend more time and energy on it .
At the same time , many of them - almost all of them , in fact - still have major surplus problems and problems complying with the Financial Regulation and the
