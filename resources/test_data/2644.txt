authorities of a non-member country proves to be incorrect , no tax penalty should be imposed solely on the importer acting in good faith .
My proposed amendment will make the situation easier for labour-intensive SMEs , especially , and will allow the risk to be distributed .
Now I have discovered that Mrs Peijs , who tabled Amendment No 9 which was approved by the committee , is withdrawing it , so we can now support this new article which I have just described and which is , I believe , a sufficiently good compromise between the Commission 's proposal and Mrs Peijs 's amendment .
An important factor here is that the pay and other working conditions of those employed in navigation should be in line with those of other occupations .
There are , however , calls far and wide to outlaw this improper competitive practice .
The issue now to be discussed shows the European Union 's resolve to counter this negative development .
All the institutions have expressed the will to tackle this issue , but often the problem has been that it has been hard to find practical ways of achieving this aim at Union level .
We must ensure that the EU develops and enlarges as a community in which market forces play the role that befits them , that is , one that is in the service of the people , and not one that dominates everyone and everything .
We need a market economy , but not a market dictatorship .
Mr President , we in Finland have a saying that once the ships were made of wood and the sailors of iron , but now the ships are of iron and the sailors are made of wood .
As the previous speaker said , it is also a matter of safety .
This is why we cannot have a situation where the safety of navigation is under threat all because of cheap labour .
Mr President , the European Commission resigned because the Committee of Independent Experts which investigated its activities found that it had been mismanaged .
Without it we would have merely swept matters under the carpet , as it were , having had two or three token resignations from Commission members .
Reading this report now , it seems unlikely that we would have had sufficient justification for dismissing everyone .
The new Commission must be appointed quickly , and it was very good to hear the President-in-Office of the Council say that the principles of the Treaty of Amsterdam would be respected in this connection .
I believe this has to be examined on the basis of what we want from the Commission .
We need time and energy to bring about reform , and capable people to manage it .
Since March 1998 Parliament 's Group of the European People 's Party has systematically highlighted failings in the work of the Commission .
The results of the report which led to the resignation simply repeat in black and white the findings of the Committee on Budgetary Control .
In the future we will need to analyse the make-up of the institution and examine the functions of Commission officials .
It is Parliament 's task to ensure that the positive reforms now under way in the Commission are carried out and that any problems that emerge are promptly dealt with .
Naturally , a temporary Commission would only operate until the end of the year , when the new Parliament will carefully consider the choice of Commissioners for the next five-year term .
Parliament has now brought about a huge change in policy and it must be ready to take the responsibility for seeing the reforms through to the end .
We are now altering the course of the Union , making for a more transparent and democratic people 's Europe .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I agree with many of the points the rapporteur , Mr Secchi , makes in his well-informed report .
The rapporteur is quite rightly firm about extending the period of transition currently in force .
The relationship in principle between indirect and direct taxation and the idea of goods and services as a source of indirect taxation are linked to the question of social fairness .
However , what we are discussing here is indirect taxation .
At least as far as food is concerned , the harmonisation of VAT in the Union would ease the situation in Finland , for example , where the VAT rate on food is , at 17 % , currently about 10 % higher than the EU average .
Consumers would gradually turn their attention more to processed foods .
Lightening the tax burden on food would make an immediate difference to how much money people had in their pocket .
It is a sort of phenomenon of suffocation .
We can make a virtue of this inevitability , though , by tying the lightening of the tax burden to policy on employment and growth .
Easing the VAT burden on food and services would therefore lend support to this policy .
Madam President , Mr De Melo has produced an excellent report , and I congratulate him on behalf of the Green Group .
I believe that the European Parliament is one of the best forums for voicing opinions , one where we have had the courage to take a position on these agreements , such as the one on the World Trade Organisation .
These would most certainly have the important task of guaranteeing improvements in communication as well as transparency and openness .
Mr President , the two rapporteurs have produced reports on the guidelines for next year 's budget , both of which form a good basis for further discussion .
I would sincerely like to thank Mrs MÃ¼ller and Mr Bourlanges accordingly .
