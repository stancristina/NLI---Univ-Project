If there are insufficient funds , the successful implementation of the programme will be undermined , and it will be impossible to begin it in good time .
This is happening in response to the so-called example gleaned from the experiences and policies of countries that have gone further along the path of privatising schools and of commercialising education .
The rash of programmes such as Learning , Leonardo , Socrates , and so forth , tend to reduce the room for manoeuvre , the authority , of each Member State , each educational institution .
Like the rapporteur , I believe that social cohesion and intercultural dialogue are among the European Union’s aims .
I welcome the support given to the creation of European virtual campuses and to the -twinning of European schools .
These results prove the high degree of quality and commitment shown by local authorities in their management of the coastline , particularly with regard to basic sanitation , water supply and pollution .
I would argue , therefore , that the definition of ‘bather ’ should be extended to include not just swimmers in the strict sense but also those taking part in water sports .
I cast my final vote against this report on the European Commission ’s document designed to update a Directive on bathing water dating from as long ago as 1976 , no less .
I also voted in favour of draft Amendment No 19 , on the question of transitory contamination .
The European Parliament is acting , yet again , to stall these plans , ensuring that Member States retain their prerogatives in this area and in respect of their international obligations .
It is quite true to say that it will only be possible to fulfil the commitments entered into at Kyoto if the information relayed by each Member State is complete , timely , transparent and comparable , and if national inventory systems are introduced at the same time .
In this way , these types of transport will become even more firmly established as the most beneficial and appealing of all .
The Commission is discussing the foundations of that framework , and Parliament will have to deliver its opinion on it .
To us , that premise seems ideologically motivated and unsound .
All this is unacceptable for two reasons : these practices constitute violations of fundamental human rights and are out-and-out attacks on democracy .
A carrot-and-stick approach to commercial and development agreements must be adopted in future .
Indeed , the change in attitudes towards these practices must be brought about through an alliance with women who have been or are being subjected to this kind of violence , and who want to fight it .     – Mr President , despite Commissioner Barnier’s undoubted competence , it is undeniable that one of the most intriguing features of European politics is the persistence of a significant level of under-execution of the Structural Funds , as measured by the execution rate for payment appropriations .
Rendering regional policy and Structural Fund management more effective , therefore , depends on the right choices being made at national level , but it also stems from regulations and from the elimination of pointless bureaucratic requirements .
It pains me greatly , therefore , to see that as much as EUR 91.6 billion in available funds – or the equivalent of the European Union’s annual budget – has not yet been used .
Similarly , the QSF-II I for 2000-2006 is still proving very irksome for the European Union .
Apart from anything else , this under-execution of the Structural Funds is extremely bad for the image of the European Union among its citizens .
For this very reason , the Structural Funds are vital to promoting genuine convergence ; they also contribute to redistribution within the Community budget .
Among other things , however , it is also worth reiterating the references to the recovery of the European economy , which , benefiting from the tail end of an improvement in the world economic climate , has managed to implement a raft of key proposals falling under the European Growth Initiative , with the support of the European Investment Bank and the involvement of the private sector , as has already been mentioned here .
Without wanting to belittle the value of the work produced by the Convention – in which I had a hand , in any case – the fact is that the revision of the Treaties began , properly speaking , when the Intergovernmental Conference opened .
Those limitations also bring the risk that funding for large projects will come to depend on the whim of the financial markets .
From preservatives to colourings , they serve specific purposes and should be effectively controlled in order to assess the risk they pose to public health .
Like the rapporteur , I fail to see why the Commission should have responsibility for deciding whether or not a substance is a sweetener until such time as Framework Directive 89/107/EC on food additives is revised .
Previous directives put in place a requirement for all Community vehicles to be insured against civil liability , for valid insurance certificates to be awarded in all the Member States , for compulsory cover for all vehicle passengers , the establishment of guarantee funds , and the famous Green Card .
On another matter , one of the most important aspects of this report concerns resetting the minimum levels of guarantees for personal injury and damage to property , in the context of the wider trend to promote victims ’ rights .
It is incumbent on the Member States , therefore , to take the necessary steps to enable the Community to become a member .
In particular , I must highlight how ironic and inexplicable it is to suggest that the Member States need Council authorisation in order to ratify
