Fundamental integration should not be interpreted as the integration and full assimilation of immigrants , nor as an offer of privileges which uphold and maintain a discriminatory system which may strengthen racist and xenophobic behaviour .
To close , I want to remind everyone that integration is not only an objective for immigrants , but the duty of each and every one of their fellow European citizens .     – Mr President , Commissioner , in these works by plenary , we have in particular debated issues relating to migration .
Our external action at Community and national level gives us many opportunities to create conditions of sustainable development in countries and communities which suffer from absolute poverty , to create jobs , democratic institutions and structures and protection for human and social rights .
In addition , Commissioner , at the level of transparency and terms of good governance , our control mechanisms must put before their responsibilities both national and local administrators in beneficiary countries .
I believe that the UN assembly in September will be a good opportunity to explicitly link development objectives to migration and , more importantly , for the response to this global problem to be a quantifiable objective within the framework of a specific timetable .
It is a well-known fact that the Union is one of the most open markets in the world , especially as a result of the 'everything but arms ' initiative for the benefit of less developed countries and the preferential treatment of other developing countries .
The concessions made by the Union and its development policy need primarily to target vulnerable countries , especially those in greatest need .
By giving 'economic aid ' to third countries , the European Union is acquiring the right to intervene in them , on the pretext of addressing situations of destabilisation , 'crisis ' and ‘unfolding crisis' , situations which constitute 'threats ' to the rule of law , law and order and the protection of human rights and to the promotion of the principles of international law , including support for special national and international criminal courts .
The MEPs of the Greek Communist Party abstained , in a refusal to take part in the theatre of the absurd being played in the European Parliament because : An EU-US agreement was signed in Athens allowing the CIA to act with impunity and now the forces which support it are 'protesting ' about its results .
No European Parliament report can be used to launder the political responsibilities of the parties that support imperialism or to delude people into believing that US-EU terrorist action will stop .
Resolutions and calls for protection of citizens ' privacy and for a balance between the fight against terrorism and human rights by the conservative and social democrat parties that predominate in the EU and in the governments are monumental hypocrisy .
The Greek Communist Party will help to uncover more of the role of the ΕU which , however hard it tries to appear sensitive and democratic , will take harsher anti-grassroots and anti-democratic measures and will feel grassroots resistance growing .     The ΕU addresses the question of immigration solely within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy , in order to increase the competitiveness of its economy ; in other words , from the point of view of increasing the profitability of European capital .
That is why its pronouncements about the social integration of immigrants are nothing more than a general wish list , without any practical backup to resolve their worsening problems .
The way to resolve their problems is through their integration in the workers ' class movement , resistance and the development of its struggle against the anti-grassroots policy of the ΕU and the governments , which are responsible for the poverty and misfortune of local and immigrant workers in the ΕU and the entire world .     – Mr President , I should like to make a serious proposal in addition to what was quite rightly said by the chairman of the Committee on International Trade , Mr Barón Crespo .
The negotiating emphasis , with concessions , is being dictated by other leading developed and dynamically developing actors .
All recent economic studies agree that the greatest benefits from the current round are expected from the opening up of the industrial products and trade services markets .
At the same time , however , it is by looking outwards that these countries will help themselves to integrate more effectively into the global trade system .
The Doha round must not founder .
However , I believe that this climate must not under any circumstances put pressure on the Commission or on Commissioner Mandelson to continue to make concessions , especially in the agricultural sector .
We want a balanced and logical compromise that will cover all sectors of the Doha round .
I fear that this is being exploited by our trading partners in order to exert greater pressure on the European Commission .     – Mr President , I should like to start by congratulating you on the victory of Spain 's national team in the World Basketball Championship .
We have the same problem daily in the Aegean .
We are a country with deficits – the only country in Europe with deficits .
According to the rules of the International Automobile Federation , trophies may only be awarded by the head of state or the prime minister of the country or the president of the federation .
In Greece , we have had serious fires : in Halkidiki , which is perhaps the most important and beautiful tourist spot in Greece , approximately 60 000 decares were burnt .
Here we must examine the matter in depth to see how we can plant species which do not burn as easily as pine trees ; - fourthly , we need to examine how
