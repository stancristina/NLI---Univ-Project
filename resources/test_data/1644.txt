Federal Republic of Serbia and Montenegro will be protected at the imminent negotiations , as expressly stated in UN Resolution 1244 which , as you said , the Council continues to support .     – Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I should like to insist , having thanked you for your reply , on one issue : following the discussions which the European Union recently had with the US leadership , is the Council in a position to assure me that there will be no unilateral action of a negative nature by the United States in the area , given the sensitivity which exists in the entire area ?     – Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , thank you for your reply .
Furthermore , we have numerous fires , numerous earthquakes and other natural disasters .
In particular , we all know that we are living in an age of uncertainty and increased mass risks , especially environmental risks .
That is why I think that we should make special reference to natural dangers .
This means that , in the revised Lisbon Strategy , environmental technologies and high environmental standards will hold an important position .
At the same time , sugar factories which are not viable – and they are quite numerous – will close and entire areas will be abandoned , both in northern Greece and in Calais in France and in other countries .
Beet producers in the countries with which the European Union has preferential agreements will also lose , because it will import sugar at lower prices .
They are no solution .
The only solution is the coordinated fight by farmers and workers to change this anti-farming and anti-grass roots policy .     – Mr President , Commissioner , Mrs Fischer Boel , the sugar market may be seen as the last of the Mohicans when it comes to products whose regime has not been reformed over recent years and which have so far escaped the philosophy behind the new common agricultural policy .
Secondly , they should apply the philosophy behind the reformed CAP to the new measures .
Thirdly , the external aspects of the regime require especially careful handling .
On the contrary , it is a strategic policy which safeguards a new qualitative consumer standard , a new environmental standard and a new dimension to rural development .
The second issue – and this relates to the first – is the problem of the coexistence of organic crops and genetically modified products .
The European Union cannot be hypocritical by promoting crops which respect public health and the environment , on the one hand , while allowing products such as modified products , on the other .
No mention is made of these issues .
The Greek state and the competent construction agency , the Thessaloniki county council , however , suddenly suspended completion of the centre for no apparent reason and refused to pay the rest of the money budgeted for it .
Nonetheless , a few hours later , both the Turkish Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs restored it .
Non-proprietary goods are not selling .
We cannot sell our products .
Europe therefore needs to decide to peg the euro to the dollar , because otherwise we shall shortly be facing a serious problem .
Social struggles are being criminalised , while radical action is seen as the number one danger and is being indirectly but clearly included in terrorist threats . 2004 can therefore be evaluated as the year in which the push to the right in the European Union was speeded up , with the main target and enemy being the people .
We have decided , as Europeans , that we consider them illegal .
We cannot say that whatever helps a police force is necessarily a good thing .
Let us hold a serious discussion , let us put all our cards on the table .
This does not work in practice ; it sounds good to the citizens but it does not resolve problems .
The Hague programme to emerge from the conclusions of the European Council in November says security is urgent and is a priority objective , especially in the light of the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 in the USA and 11 March in Madrid .
On this basis , therefore , we consider that the Hague programme is sick , not only in its application but , more importantly , in general .     . – Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the debate of the two previous items , especially the statements by Minister Frieden and Commissioner Frattini , has confirmed and substantiated the position that the creation of an area of freedom , security and justice is a fundamental policy and core objective of the European Union .
The application by the College of common police training programmes , based on the experience of all the national police academies in the Member States of the Union , is accepted by everyone as having resulted in the adoption at pan-European level of common training standards and methods .
These amendments achieve the following : core responsibility for the operation of the College remains with the transnational governing board .
Parliament will have the right to send an observer , at its discretion , to the College 's governing board and will , in any event , have the right under the proposal to check the College 's annual report through the Union budget .
I believe that the amendments proposed by the Committee on Civil Liberties improve the proposal .
We , as Greeks , have been very familiar with this means of transport for 3 000 years : the first cargo recorded in maritime history was the golden fleece carried by the Argonauts 5 500 years ago
