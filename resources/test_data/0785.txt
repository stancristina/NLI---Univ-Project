with the Committee on Foreign Affairs , the Joint Parliamentary Committee ( JPC ) , and everyone else , visited Turkey , I got the feeling that something was shifting and could see a little light at the end of the tunnel , as Commissioner Rehn commented before .
We frequently receive reports that the freedom of the media and press leave something to be desired and that the press , when it exercises it freedoms , is subsequently faced with fiscal assessments or other measures .
This needs to change .
Nevertheless , we have to recognise that Macedonia is no worse off than other states during their accession negotiations and even sometimes after their accession .
For this reason , a solution must be agreed by both states at the earliest opportunity .
My group subscribes to the main conclusion in the report , namely that too little progress has been made recently .
I should like to mention a few points from this excellent report .
I can only say that I hope that the optimism displayed by Commissioner Rehn is justified .
It is very unfortunate that websites , including YouTube , are still not available in Turkey , and there is unacceptable pressure from the government on parts of the media .
Mr President , in Paragraph 17 , rapporteur Mrs Oomen-Ruijten calls upon the whole of Turkish society to practise freedom of religion on a large scale .
All countries in the region must lend their full cooperation , and the International Criminal Tribunal should be given the chance to conclude its activities with due care .
This is why it is also good that this report stresses the importance of the proper functioning of an independent and impartial justice system .
Needless to say , we cannot wait for the reactions to it , as is always the case with a Green Paper .
I take the view that this also applies to other areas : to the policy on tobacco and discouraging smoking , for example , where the European Union leads the way , not only in the Union , but also beyond .
In each case , people and well-intended interests are involved .
We have to examine whether this should not be better addressed at European level after all .
We are , however , being stretched on the basis of the present Treaty texts to tackle these problems .
The Commissioner said herself that a rise in the ageing population will indeed bring more pressure to bear on health systems , but also , and mainly , on workers .
I have found out that there are Polish doctors who work in Polish hospitals on normal contracts during the week , and travel to the United Kingdom during the weekend to do a 48-hour shift there .
As far as I am concerned , this actually applies more to Brazil than to Mexico , the subject of our debate this morning .
How is it possible that the European Union , which always puts itself forward as a promoter of regional cooperation , could allow its bilateral relations with Brazil to take preference over its regional cooperation with Mercosur ?
I am not saying that that would be easy , but I do believe this to be a better way forward than making rhetorically appealing declarations .
First remark : where it speaks about the Macedonian negotiator in paragraph 12 , the text should be 'the negotiator of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ' .
I participated in all these debates .
The second view is that the accession of Turkey will always be undesirable as the country is viewed as Asian , Islamic , too large and too dangerous .
In the VVD 's view , Turkey has made too little progress in recent years and there is therefore no reason to speed up negotiations .
The provision of water must be , and remain , in public hands .
States like this one are not a product of the will of the people .
The government will then respond with more state-sponsored violence , perhaps without even admitting that this violence is being perpetrated by the state .
These different peoples are made subject , by all possible means , to the authority of the capital , Khartoum .
Comments like this are popular with certain sections of domestic public opinion and give the impression that a rich and powerful Europe is able to impose its solutions on the rest of the world .
It was , in fact , the first time that the European Union and the African Union had together laid down a strategy on the basis of shared values and principles and mutual respect , that they had reached agreements to achieve the Millennium Development Goals together and to find solutions together to common challenges in the areas of , for example , security , migration and the climate .
Today , we are discussing the implementation of the agreed strategy and we have an action plan .
It is also thanks to Mr Gahler , our colleagues in the Pan-African Parliament and all those involved that an agreement has been reached on the role of the parliaments .
This is essential in a continent where mayors can overthrow presidents and where another president has been crippling his own population to carry out witch hunts .
Such situations are really quite distressing .
I would like to thank you , my fellow Members , the Commissioner and our colleagues from the Pan-African Parliament .
The financial crisis , tougher competition as a result of globalisation , the climate crisis and the failure , as yet , to achieve the Lisbon objectives demand a more integrated approach , together with a strengthening of , and an improvement drive in , regional policy
