or accede to this Convention .     .
Consideration of the child’s best interests should be invoked for its intrinsically high value , not because it is called for in a text which , in any case , lacks any legal value at present .
The principles of solidarity , flexibility and effectiveness complement rather than compete with each other . - Amendment to paragraph 35( b ) of the motion for a resolution : in accordance with the principle of simplification , and on the basis of one of the aims of improving the utilisation of the funds , I propose that provisions be made for an opportunity to analyse whether combining the funds and centralising the way they are managed would help to improve their efficiency .
This is due , in large part , to two factors .
I could not agree more with the proposals of both the Committee of Independent Experts and the European Parliament that , in each Member State , a single directorate-general should be entirely responsible for the implementation of the Structural Funds .
Will it enjoy effective powers ?
The citizens of Europe want to feel secure against the threat of violence , external or internal , but they do not want to be the vassals of any unilateral power , even if it appears in the guise of an ally .
I believe it is time to take up a clear position condemning this aspect of the policy of this United States administration .     .
The aim , however , is not to harmonise the relevant legislation in the Member States .
The proposal’s second aim is to facilitate access to compensation for crime victims in cross-border situations .
The manual thus established shall be available in all of the official languages of the European Union .     – Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , once again we have on the table a measure geared towards creating an area of freedom , security and justice – a measure which attempts to respond to the day-to-day concerns of citizens .
I welcome this proposal for a directive , therefore , as well as Mrs Angelilli’s report .
With regard to these amendments , I would just like to draw attention to the fact that , to my mind , Parliament should preserve the essence of an initiative such as this , based on common minimum standards .
I believe that your contribution to this debate has been crucial .
I can see that this is an issue which requires further consideration , particularly since similar exclusions apply under the Council of Europe protocol concerning transportation of organs and tissues of human origin .
Mr President , the Commission followed very closely and with growing concern the dramatic and tragic events which shook Bolivia last week .
The Commission has called upon all Bolivians to work together in an open and constructive spirit to find consensual solutions to the many challenges facing their country .
As a result we are considering drawing on the rapid reaction mechanism budget line , up to EUR 1 million , and are examining ideas and proposals for concrete short-term measures in the field of conflict prevention and management , which we hope to discuss in the very near future in close coordination with the new government of President Carlos Mesa .
Ladies and gentlemen , I can only say to you that while we sympathise with the victims of this disaster , we must also draw the right conclusions from it .
We need a fisheries policy that does more than reel off obituaries in the aftermath of measures that neither permit nor encourage sustainable fishing .     .
We do , however , welcome Parliament’s approval of our proposal requesting that the Commission maintain the level of funding for East Timor , bearing in mind the ongoing need for reconstruction in that country and the international undertakings signed with it .
This is crucial not only in order to alleviate the harm and suffering caused , as far as possible , but also to deal with the social conflict created by the crime and facilitate the application of a properly rational criminal policy .
The December 2002 Council proposed a definitive recovery plan for these stocks , with a view to ensuring the safe recovery of the cod stocks to the precautionary stock sizes advised by scientists within a time frame of five to ten years .
These areas are peripheral and highly vulnerable , since there is limited scope for diversifying the local economy , and access to markets is restricted .
Parliament is insisting that freight services ( international and national ) and international passenger services should have access to rail networks by 1 January 2006 .
I hope , then , that this will be yet another step towards the goal of a true internal market for railways , which will , what is more , effectively reduce road traffic density on our highways , in particular the huge volume of goods transported in heavy lorries .     .
According to the Council , these should ensure that a high level of safety is maintained and can be improved , when reasonably practicable and taking into account the competitiveness of the rail transport mode .
That is why I voted for this report .
The complete finalisation of this proposal for a directive by the European Commission , with a view to accelerating the implementation of interoperability between different participants in the European rail system , is also directly linked to the creation of the European Railway Agency , dealt with in the Savary report .
Naturally , Parliament wants representatives of the workers ’ organisations to participate in the working parties which will later draw up recommendations , and not just , as the Council suggests , in the subsequent consultation process
