both of their content and of the speed with which these laws have been devised .
Unfortunately , it was not .
I therefore think that Parliament has not accepted its responsibilities when it comes to protecting those deprived of their freedom and safeguarding human rights .
The same concerns also apply to the interpretations brought to bear upon how a terrorist group is really to be defined .
It has also been made impossible for Somalians to send money to needy families and relatives .
Mr President , Commissioner , President-in-Office of the Council , the European Parliament has lofty ambitions in terms of human rights .
More and more countries are signing fine declarations and international conventions , but these are often not complied with .
These matters are obviously important , but they are extremely closely linked to human rights .
There is a broad agenda of issues that the EU must tackle in Geneva : violence against women , the situation of children , torture and the death penalty .
First of all , China , which holds the very dubious world record for the number of executions carried out there .
Let there be a resolution this year .
Finally , Tunisia .
At the same time , it is absolutely clear that it is the paramilitaries who , aided by Colombia ' s military , are responsible for most , by far , of the violence in Colombia .
I am afraid that the Council did not understand my specific question .
Does the Council believe that the Indonesian authorities have taken the necessary , adequate measures for dismantling the Islamic terrorist group , Laskar Jihad ?
Mr President , Commissioner , one of the recitals of this report states that extremely large regional differences constitute both a political and economic threat to the EU.
Enlargement is very important for the whole of Europe , and it is not the poorest regions which should pay for enlargement .
That applies especially in the fields of education , research , employment and transport .
Mr President , Commissioner , I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur , Mr Hatzidakis , for the considerable openness and readiness to compromise that have characterised his work on this report .
When it came into force in 1994 , it had met a certain amount of resistance both from the industry and from the drivers themselves , but this evaporated when the advantages became apparent .
Recently , there has been a marked increase in the frequency of accidents involving lighter commercial vehicles .
I do not believe that is the case .
In that case , the traffic flows more smoothly .
However , I am at the same time concerned that the work has led to the request for a long list of legislative initiatives on the part of the Commission , relating for example to lifelong learning , organisation of work , the need to reconcile work and private life , working environment policy , supplementary sickness insurance and the hiring-out of staff .
There are two main reasons why I believe that demands for legislative initiatives within these areas are the wrong road to go down .
Secondly , I believe that adding more and more pages of legislation to the thousands upon thousands of pages that the candidate countries are now already required to accept and incorporate into their own legislation would make it considerably more difficult to implement any enlargement of the EU.
Unfortunately , the initiatives are , as I said just now , to be taken at the wrong level .
However , we do not believe that increased parliamentarisation of the EU requires the European Parliament ' s powers to be extended where all the EU' s decisions are concerned .
We voted in favour of paragraph 8 of the report because we agree with the rapporteur that it cannot be regarded as legitimate - in terms either of the practicalities or of providing representation - for MEPs to have a double mandate , that is to say with seats in both the European Parliament and a national/regional parliament .
Madam President , I should like first of all to congratulate Mrs Cederschi√∂ld on becoming the first Swedish Vice-President of the European Parliament .
Parliament - the very heart of democracy - was exposed to a brutal assault .
Imagine if our own Parliament here in Strasbourg or our national parliaments - in my case , the riksdag in Stockholm - were to be exposed to a terrorist attack .
I believe that the Commissioner and the European Union have an incredibly important task when it comes to promoting a form of education in these schools that is based upon the ideas of love and of love of one ' s neighbour and does not see other religions or other political outlooks with the eyes of hatred , for it is in these madrassas and other Islamicist contexts that hatred is disseminated .
Pakistan operated as a training ground for the Al-Qa ' ida terrorists .
What President Musharraf has said is important .
The issue of how they are being treated has given rise to international concern .
We have protested in the European Parliament , and we are not alone in having protested .
There is some confusion about the legal status of the prisoners at the base at Guantanamo Bay , and this issue needs to be clarified by a competent court .
The chairman of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , Graham Watson , said yesterday in the House that we are actually in favour of a review of the Geneva Convention .
We have shown this very clearly through our vote earlier today .
We require that there be common rules and that everyone be treated in the same way and be given ordinary legal rights and legal protection in civil courts .
