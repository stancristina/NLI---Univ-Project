The fight against terrorism must always be marked by the values of the democratic rule of law , by respect for citizens ' rights and by common standards of justice .
It is worth emphasising that the proposal for the creation of a 'mechanism for evaluating the legal systems and their implementation at national level in the fight against terrorism ' bypasses and breaches the legal base that currently exists in the Treaties .
( PT ) My vote in favour of this report reflects my agreement with the two initiatives by Spain aimed at establishing measures to facilitate cooperation between the police and judicial authorities in the fight against terrorism .
This limitation means that it cannot receive funding from Community or Member States ' budgets , which will change if this French initiative is adopted , as it will then be eligible for funding under the EU 's general budget .
Equally important is the recognition of the need to support the implementation of Article 27 of the Protocol , at the first session of Conference of the Parties , establishing a framework for the development of an internationally acceptable system in the field of civil responsibility and of compensation for losses and damage caused by GMOs , and to incorporate specific precautions into every aspect of producing foods for human and animal consumption .
Furthermore , my vote reflects my support for the magnificent report by Mrs Angelilli .
As far as budgetary issues are concerned , in order of presentation , I wish to thank the LIBE committee , Mr Ceyhun in particular , for the non-stop support this Commission has been given in establishing the area of freedom , security and justice .
Nevertheless , I will make a plea for careful examination , bearing in mind such difficulties as human resources .
We recognised that , whilst informing and communicating with citizens must be a priority , we have to ensure that we have the capacity , especially in terms of human resources , to manage the expenditure of the funds .
At the meeting of the Interinstitutional Group on Information later today , we must reflect on the amounts proposed in the amendments and the practical implications .
The information to the candidate countries on the euro is included in the enlargement campaign , and the Commission believes that , in the case of the countries which are not yet part of the euro , the necessary funds will be proposed the day that each of these countries decides to join the euro .
Secondly , the Structural Fund must under no circumstances be confused with this solidarity fund .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , at a time when we are debating the revision of the common fisheries policy , the budget for 2003 assumes particular importance , and so we hope that the Commission will provide the budgetary authority with information on the budgetary impact of the revision , as the Committee on Fisheries recommends in the opinion that it adopted for the Committee on Budgets .
Mr President , Commissioners , I have five very specific questions to ask .
Why is the Commission thinking of reducing the fleet by eight thousand vessels when the reform 's effects on the Mediterranean , which is home to a large part of the European fleet , are still not known ?
As everyone knows , this was designed for sectors in which the Member States retain their autonomy .
In recent years , the Portuguese labour market has generally performed well .
Most of the jobs created during these years have been precarious , part-time or very short-term , and which fail to guarantee that equal rights and opportunities will be complied with .
It is particularly significant that there is widespread lack of knowledge in the Member States about the European Employment Strategy and that their national plans do not contain quantitative objectives , specifically employment rates for women - as defined at the Lisbon Summit - and nor are these plans being presented in the national parliaments or debates held on their content .
We call for timetabled performance targets to be established - on the quantitative and qualitative representation of women , both in internal decision-making structures and in collective bargaining , including at the forthcoming trilateral social summit - and I now wish to draw the Commissioner 's attention to this matter - and also for reports to be drafted on the progress made and the impact of the measures adopted .
In order to remedy the glaringly obvious shortfall in the representation of women in the decision-making structures and bodies of the social partners , three measures , in particular , are to be emphasised .
In my country , for example , the rate of women in employment has been steadily increasing and is one of the highest in the European Union .
Therefore , the balanced representation of men and women , apart from being a democratic imperative for the social partners , will lead to a more favourable working and organisational environment .
I therefore agree with the rapporteur on the need to adopt the Council common position as rapidly as possible and without amendments , given that most of the amendments tabled by Parliament have been taken into account , whilst new elements have also been incorporated , which have helped to improve the clarity of the text under our consideration .
The Commission proposal warrants our vote .
I am actually sensitive to the need for coordination procedures to be established in the field of asylum policy and even , for the sovereignty and the competences of the Member States to be respected , with regard to the permanent incorporation of a method of coordination in the field of asylum in order to encourage the convergence of national systems .
With regard to the Hulth√©n report , my colleague , Peter Liese , will address this issue .
We set out ,
