nature of macroeconomic aid : these are Amendments Nos 2 , 8 and 13 , which refer to linking this type of macroeconomic aid with the CART programme , and they therefore ask for the same conditions as for the CART projects .
Obviously we are prepared to provide all the necessary information .
I would like to make a comment on two other amendments that I think are of interest : Amendment No 12 asks for two things .
The Commission accepts the spirit of the request , but we think that its wording needs to be improved in order to prevent practical problems .
Distance , internal dispersion and climate have been significant obstacles to their development .
In any case , in order to continue to make progress in integrating these regions into the European area and in order to deal with phenomena that have appeared recently with the growing process of globalisation , we need to have a sounder legal basis and strengthen the regulations that have been operating up until now .
The amendments on specific sensitive products from each region concern tomatoes in the Canary Islands , livestock , milk products and the sugar industry in the Azores and the wicker industry in Madeira , and support for rice in some of the French territories .
Mr President , as I think that you all already know , the negotiations to renew the fisheries agreement with Morocco came to an end without that renewal having taken place .
We know that the Commission intends to put forward a proposal for a Regulation in this respect at the next Council of Fisheries Ministers on 18 June , but for technical reasons it will not be able to be adopted until 3 July , which will cause a considerable delay in the timetable , given that consultation by the European Parliament is also provided for .
I would like to highlight Amendment No 5 to that report , because I think that it fits in much better with Article 29 , Paragraph 4 of Regulation (EC ) No 1260/1999 , which allows a maximum contribution of 50 % to SMEs in the outermost regions .
They aim to fulfil the objective of economic and social cohesion , they are balanced for each and every one of the regions affected and implicitly recognise the rights of the citizens of the European Union within the financial neutrality recommended by the Commission .
The sector affected , which is a large sector , has more questions than answers about its future .
In the budgetary context defined by the stability agreement reached in order to allow Economic and Monetary Union , the financial statement proposed by the Commission complies strictly with the criteria of budgetary neutrality .
Above all , however , I want to point out three or four amendments to Mr Fischler that are of particular importance .
Mr President , it is important that today in the European Parliament we have been able to adopt at first reading the so-called Erika II package , the name of which reminds us of the sad case of a vessel that sank at the end of 1999 , a year and a half ago , causing a great tidal wave and considerable consequences on the coast of north east France and its marine environment .
The proposal recognises that in many instances the administrative costs of managing and processing the aid do not match the amount of aid that these small-scale farmers receive .
I believe that if we had done that we would today have much more precise information about the subjects we are dealing with .
We believe a series of proceedings should be started against all those involved in the murder of Bishop Gerardi , as suggested in the very well-balanced report on the case , entitled ' Guatemala , never again ' .
The recent court sentences , such as the one that has been mentioned regarding the murder of Bishop Gerardi , have revealed just how important it is that justice and the rule of law should take their usual course and function normally , as in any democratic system , but we must not forget or stand in the way of the changes and pressures that have arisen in this process .
Such a percentage should not leave any doubt as to the legitimacy of his election , were it not for the accusations of irregularities made by the other candidates and the independent national election monitoring body .
The Group of the Party of European Socialists asks you to support their resolution and also asks the Commission to adopt their declaration so that the government of Chad can learn of our concern and the sections of Chadian society that have been edged out of the electoral process can realise that they can count on our solidarity .
I think it is worth remembering that , according to the United Nations intergovernmental panel on climate change , there is already evidence that if the current trends of increasing greenhouse gas emissions are not corrected , such disasters - floods , droughts , storms and so on - will become ever more normal .
I remember very well what happened in the Do√±ana National Park , when a pond of toxic waste burst its banks , flooded a river and a vast area of water meadows and destroyed the livelihoods of 5000 farmers .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the report unanimously approved in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 25 April on Community measures for the control of classical swine fever proposes an early diagnosis system and maintenance of the Community method for controlling the disease and slaughter , since not enough progress has yet been made on marker vaccines .
