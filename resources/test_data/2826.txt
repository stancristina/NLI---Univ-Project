an inter-governmental conference 's ineptitude in solving these fundamental problems is EMU.
With that , the democracy deficit and the future lack of central bank control is clear .
Mr President , our group have given their support for Commissioner Monti 's attempts to achieve some degree of organization in the single market and we also support his endeavours in this plan of action for a unified market .
We cannot talk of a single market if we have to contend with this kind of thing .
This actually brings the realization that the European economic policy is based on the principle of an ecologically and socially sound market policy .
I believe that the European Union must work from this basis in the global arena also .
I can assure you it is no such thing .
With the Summit Conference on Employment coming up next week , it is vital to discuss taxation .
I am in agreement with the ideas expressed by Alman Metten of the Social Democratic Party .
We must pay attention to this , because , quite rightly , these types of business must be aided by the internal markets .
We think we need a high-level risk assessment process for all new materials .
A certain construction engineer told me once that above that splendid wooden ceiling there is fibreglass and rock wool .
One of our amendments concerns our opinion that the re-use and recycling of builder 's waste should be promoted .
Madam President , according to my information , the situation , unfortunately , is not as good as Mr von Habsburg has said .
Only one committee in the Slovakian Parliament has proposed modifying the suggested increase in the threshold rate of VAT to 23 % The rest of the Parliament would appear to be intent on voting tomorrow on the 23 % .
I intend to withhold my proposal because it is important that we bring pressure to bear as the elections approach .
The formal decision in parliament has not changed things .
We know that there is now a very precise language law at state level but only constitutional references for the situation of the different minorities .
Ms McKenna 's report describes the dangers to marine birds from fishing tackle .
Species are being threatened partly as a result of being trapped in fishing nets .
There is no legal enforcement in the region .
With general reference to the fisheries agreements , the means whereby the Council and the Commission have again reviewed the agreements are not acceptable .
Negotiations to review the procedures should commence right away so that the European Parliament can be properly heard .
Mr President , the three Baltic Republics share certain common characteristics .
All three were occupied by the Soviet Union for more than 50 years , interrupted only by German occupation during the Second World War .
All three are small countries .
I hope they will make it by the time the Union has made the necessary institutional reforms .
I understand the reasons for excluding Latvia and Lithuania but I do not see a big difference between the three countries in terms of development towards accession .
Having today 's Russia as a neighbour should not be considered a threat .
It gives us a chance to participate in a development that will lead , hopefully , to a still larger family of European nations , including Russia .
I know that the Baltic Republics share the same aspirations .
Building stable institutions and the rule of law must one day lead to a multicultural , multilingual society where nobody will be excluded .
Mr President , the Committee on Legal Affairs shares the Commission 's concern about the inability of the applicant countries to apply Community legislation in their administrative and judicial systems .
The Committee has also proposed , and the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Security and Defence Policy has taken up the need for effective and reliable systems for property and company registration .
When there are deficiencies in this system , you do not have the conditions , that is , the basis , for a market economy .
This wording is too vague .
We cannot create a stable Europe without respect for the rights of minorities .
I noticed that the Commission only mentioned children in Romania , Bulgaria and Lithuania .
In the future assessment of the Phare programme we should also find out how funds have been used to improve the position of children .
We must also press for the banning of child prostitution in all applicant countries .
In terms of GDP many applicant countries are at the same stage as mid-level developing countries , and some even have a lower level of income .
It is quite likely that the meagre resources available for the EU enlargement process will make it tempting to redirect funds traditionally used by the EU and its Member States to help developing countries towards the candidate countries .
The Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs is to be congratulated on its approval of the point in the report which excludes the possibility of shifting economic resources dedicated to the developing world to aid new and future Member States .
The EU with its Member States is the world 's largest provider of development aid .
For example , they must be helped to bring in legislation on job protection and product safety , which must meet EU monitoring requirements .
The well-matched system of negotiations between employers and employees is a part of democracy and European welfare .
The Commission 's assessment that the costs of enlargement might be covered by economic growth seem over-optimistic .
That is why I agree with Mr Colom i Naval that the whole framework has to be checked mid-term if there are significant changes to what we suppose to be its basic tenets
