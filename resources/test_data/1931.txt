We urge the governments to support the Portuguese Presidency in its proposal .
We believe it is imperative not just to make every available effort to provide the citizens with comprehensive information on how the Intergovernmental Conference is going , and its outcome , rather they must be directly involved in the overall reform process to a far greater extent .
It is indeed the case that globalisation of national economies , but above all the introduction of the euro and the associated stability pact have led to a situation where we need to do more than analyse decision-making processes .
This is particularly important where enlargement is concerned , and legislation and in relation to treaties , which entail changes being made to legislation .
If we succeed in making progress here , then we will also be ready for the historic task of enlarging the European Union .
Consequently , I do not see that there is any real obstacle to the Council ' s being able to move matters on quickly as far as these two draft directives are concerned .
Of course I would add that I continue to support this committee ' s amendments , which they adopted unanimously .
My comments start from the premise that we are talking about an upright individual in gainful employment .
We want to achieve a completely flexible solution .
Why do I think we need the directive so much ?
On a final note , I too believe that OLAF requires monitoring under rule of law .
That is excellent news !
Only then would we have been able to conduct proper and searching discussions .
Rather , we must use this initiative to establish a long-term aid strategy for this country , and I hope that in the process , you will fulfil your political obligations at long last and not allow things to continue as they have been doing for the past few months .
It is irrelevant , as far as I am concerned , as to whether it is Serbs , Roma , Bosnians or Albanians who are threatened or killed in Kosovo .
However I have to say the Finnish President-in-Office of the Council had relatively little power to act as long as the Member States blocked the necessary increase in this funding .
In addition , the continued existence of the ALTENER programme will guarantee the promotion and implementation of pilot projects for creating and extending infrastructure , for transfer of expertise and for targeted activities intended to relieve market penetration of renewable energies .
That being the case , since ALTENER is the only EU programme to have the exclusive aim of promoting renewable energy sources , it will certainly be have a key role .
One seems powerless in a dialogue of this kind , where the other party actually has to reach a unanimous decision .
Cultural activity creates identity .
The political fight over funding and programme structuring is out of all proportion to the volume of support .
We believe that the directive has a few weaknesses that we in the House should work on to produce a directive which is genuinely ground-breaking .
We must understand that the bigger picture is important when it comes to the environmental impact of cars .
As for a ban on certain materials : of course we need one !
Here we find ourselves fundamentally at odds with last year 's debate in the Council when freedom from costs for the last owner and the issue of financing were lumped together and a question mark placed over whether the last owner should really be free from costs .
The intention of Florenz and Lange in their amendments is obvious : to sabotage the directive !
For there are considerably more than two million people employed in this sector .
In terms of the people who build cars here in Europe , I am in favour of not making competition unequal but , in terms of environmental protection , I want freedom from costs for the last owner , to be financed by a special fund , and manufacturer responsibility for new cars , which will force them to assume responsibility for building recyclable cars ! ( Applause from the PSE Group )
However , I fear that a purely emotional reaction by Europe to the events in Austria will only multiply Haider 's adherents .
I would have liked to see the same outrage in Europe when the socialists were prepared to make common cause with the successors to the misanthropic and persecutory regime in the DDR.
That is absolutely absurd .
A compromise has now also been reached on the issue of asylum seekers .
Only then does it stop being a question of economic usability and start being about people having equal rights to shape their own lives .
We attached particular importance to linking the creation of new jobs for disadvantaged and excluded people in the social sector , in tourism and in small and medium-sized enterprises with promoting the establishment of new small and medium-sized businesses bearing in mind the necessary economic structural change .
It is precisely a strictly defined list of criteria which is essential if the programmes which are funded are to be models and be transferable to other problem cities in the future .
We want a Europe for the people and not a Europe of paper-pushers !
It is important for there to be coordination between LEADER+ and the other support initiatives in the European Union , but coordination with other national support schemes is also just as important .
I do think , though , that the LEADER+ programme has not got a penny to spare on additional administrative tasks , which in the normal course of events would have to be carried out by the Commission in any case .
In this way , LEADER+ can , together
