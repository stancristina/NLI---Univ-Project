Tax resources should be used in another way , for example so that people can improve themselves and be given choices in life .
( SV ) We have voted against Smet ' s report on the regulation of domestic help .
There is great demand for domestic help .
Many women and young people work in this market .
We therefore agree with the rapporteur that it is important for the differences between the costs of 'black ' and 'white ' labour to be reduced and feel that the Member States should introduce a tax reduction on domestic services .
Guy-Quint report ( A5-0327/2000 )
We are of the opinion , however , that there are very significant differences between the issue of tobacco advertising and this directive .
It is particularly important to establish clear limit values for the hazardous substances contained in the smoke .
We are also in favour of the ban on habit-forming additives .
This is a marketing strategy which is often misleading and which gives the false impression that these cigarettes do not carry the same risks as other cigarettes .
This is inconsistent , and it is becoming expensive .
I do not consider there to be any reason to change the current rules , i .e . an exception in the case of Sweden , nor , at the same time , the right of countries which do not wish to sell snuff to uphold their ban .
In the beginning , most people were against it .
This is the case irrespective of the type of crime committed .
Victims of crime must know their rights and what opportunities they actually have for receiving help .
It can be difficult for a foreign victim to follow the criminal procedures from a distance , and in this case it is clear that special measures are required .
Crimes must be solved , and if this does not happen it will , in the long term , threaten the democratic system .
Who will then go out and vote if their problems are completely disregarded ?
Crime is no accident .
Therefore , I am pleased that the rapporteur has drawn up this report , which I commend with enthusiasm .
There may therefore be cause for questioning the concept of 'summer time ' when it relates to seven out of twelve months , that is to say the majority of the year .
Nonetheless , the Member States ought themselves to be responsible for working out the details .
Only in a few clearly defined cases ( relating , for example , to sexual crimes and crimes involving child pornography , where secrecy is required ) may there be exemptions from holding open proceedings in court .
It reads , ' Everyone is equal , but some are more equal than others . '
For the Swedish negotiators , it would appear to have been more important to please the large Member States than to fight for our own influence .
Nice means more supranationalism and centralism , which are precisely what the EU did not need .
Mr President , the most important result from Nice was that , in spite of everything , there was a treaty , so that a place can now be prepared for the applicant States .
This is contrary to the whole idea of the EU. 2.
The people must be involved in future . 4 .
The forthcoming constitutional debate must lead to simplification , distribution of powers and increased democracy .
Our new colleagues must be allowed to participate in the discussions as new Members on equal conditions .
We shall be able to adopt a Budget within this framework , which is a great success .
This gives us an opportunity to be an active partner where enlargement to include the countries in Central and Eastern Europe is concerned and when it comes to helping establish peace and prosperity in Serbia and the former Yugoslavia .
It is nonetheless important to note that we must cope successfully with this too within the current Budget framework .
As a Swedish Christian Democrat , I fully support the two-strategy model which Mr Oostlander presents , involving vigorous , consistent and sustained criticism of all crimes , especially crimes within Russia against human rights , but also involving close and intimate cooperation with Russia , our large neighbour in the East .
With reference to the report we presented in Minsk , we first of all emphasised that the Belarus Parliament is at present lacking in powers , cannot legislate , does not have the right of veto against Presidential decrees and cannot adopt budgets .
Belarus is therefore in political union with Russia .
I nonetheless believe that the proposal tabled by the French Presidency is completely unacceptable and that it really has only one aim , namely to keep asylum seekers out of the EU , something which may in practice lead to an increase in illegal immigration .
If it is true that those who are regarded as refugees under the Geneva Convention are to be excluded , what actual powers do check-in staff at an airport in Istanbul possess to decide a refugee ' s fate , for that is what this issue is about .
Thank you for your answer .
I should like to thank the French presidency for its answer .
I nonetheless want to ask whether the Council welcomes this type of very contradictory and unclear statement from the Commission ' s President .
Mr President , company structures in the European market need to be made more efficient if Europe is to hold its own in the global market .

Greater understanding must be shown for national characteristics .
Companies may be quoted on different markets , and
