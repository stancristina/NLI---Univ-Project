Word for word , the note reads : 'the German Presidency calls on the governments concerned to introduce a moratorium on the death penalty with immediate effect ' .
To conclude my speech , Madam President , I should like to point out that , 60 years ago , there was a Rome-Berlin axis .
I hope that the Congress against the Death Penalty being held in Paris , in which we , as Parliament , will take part , will be a further step on from the moratorium on the way to abolishing the death penalty and eradicating poverty around the world .
Is it not the case , though , that the situation will end up as it has in Italy , where the 2007 budget law favours those who are in a position to buy new vehicles and actually condemns precisely those who are least well-off , who cannot afford to change their vehicles , to a lack of mobility and heavy costs ?
The ECB had been informed about the issue right from the start , and it played a leading role in this instrument - I shall not go into the matter of its transparency .
Making better laws must become an imperative for the institutions , and on this point Parliament must act as the catalyst .
We are pleased that the Presidency of the Council is paying attention to this issue , too .
Development and the environment are the challenges to which we must respond , including by ratifying a new treaty that defines the new and differing areas of responsibility of our institutions within the 27-member Europe . on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( IT ) Madam President , Mrs Fischer Boel , ladies and gentlemen , above and beyond its role as an agricultural and economic product , wine represents our history , culture and traditions .
Mrs Fischer Boel , the wine sector needs a reform that promotes greater competitiveness in European wine , by continuing with the restructuring of vines to make them more competitive and by promoting the maintenance of viticulture to act as protection for the land and the environment .
Radio Spectrum ( debate ) on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am making this proposal on behalf of my group and under Rule 155(6 ) of the Rules of Procedure : I propose a block vote on 122 amendments that are complementary to each other , in order to simplify procedure .
Above all , we collaborated in our respective roles in producing the Constitutional Treaty , for which you now reiterate your staunch support .
That explains the special kind of experience that one gains in the European Parliament .
Ladies and gentlemen , 2001 , 2002 and 2003 did not see a pause ; rather , it was a time of serious , genuine and profound reflection .
In reality , we are paying the price for having made little effort to involve the citizens in the major decisions about European integration and unification , or to inform public opinion in every country about the extraordinary results and progress that we have achieved in 50 years and the new , ever more pressing needs to strengthen the EU in terms of its cohesion and its ability to act .
The time has come , however , for Europe to find a way out of the impasse .
Nonetheless , ladies and gentlemen , the EU cannot go very far down the path of results with its current institutional framework .
The Constitutional Treaty cleared away any fear or suspicion of a swing towards a centralised superstate by more clearly enshrining the distribution of powers and guaranteeing respect for the principle of subsidiarity .
We are about to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Treaties of Rome , and it is important to use the occasion to reaffirm that prospect and that choice , while clearly setting out our new rationales and our new ambitions .
No one can deny the extent of the new threats , challenges and opportunities facing us .
This contribution is symbolised by the figures of a far-sighted statesman , Alcide De Gasperi , and of a passionate prophet and fighter for the European idea , Altiero Spinelli , the centenary of whose birth we are celebrating this year .
I believe that we need to encourage the Roma to take part in social and political life , but for that to happen the Member States must first recognise them as an ethnic and linguistic minority .
Italy , the number one wine exporter in the world , has made high quality its banner , together with respect for consumers and the traditions of wine-making .
This report is schizophrenic : on the one hand it talks about promoting quality , while on the other it comes down in favour of enrichment with sugar ; on the one hand it talks about protecting geographical designations , while on the other it opens the door to new wine-making practices , such as wine with shavings .
Europe needs to be able to compete with its competitors on equal terms .
The fifty years since the signing of the treaties have witnessed many achievements and common policies .
The future of Europe cannot escape the realisation that the present is different from that of fifty years ago .
' The contribution that an organised and living Europe can bring to civilisation is indispensable to the maintenance of peaceful relations' , Schuman declared in 1950 , saying : 'world peace cannot be safeguarded without the making of creative efforts proportionate to the dangers that threaten it ' .
We realise that there are now delays in achieving the expected targets .
It addresses the commercial dimension of Euro-Mediterranean relations in a novel and thorough way .
