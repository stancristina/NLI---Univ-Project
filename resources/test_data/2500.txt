There is great hope for the future , but we must make sure that we keep up the pressure on Zimbabwe and especially on Mr Mugabe .
We should take direct action against assets that President Mugabe owns outside of Zimbabwe .
We must take the argument directly to the man who has created the problems .
Mr President , I would join my voice to those who have talked about the tragedy of Dover and the young lives cut short there , but I also want to add my revulsion at the attitude of many people : well , what do you expect , if you take these risks you have got to expect that you might die .
It is a cruel and judgmental attitude that has appeared in much of the press and it does not help us find a solution .
If governments are serious about combating trafficking , these are three areas they need to think about .
How can people legally enter the countries of the European Union , especially those coming from third countries which experience poverty or oppression ?
Secondly , how can we gain the confidence of those who could provide evidence against trafficking organisations .
I welcome what we have heard about that this afternoon .
Thirdly , how the current policies of the European Union and its Member States help to create refugees .
We should not be concentrating so much on a deterrent policy at our borders .
We need to look at how we are contributing to the incentive to leave .
We need to examine the consequences of our policies on , for example , trade , its rules and terms and who we will trade with , the conduct of companies based in the European Union and their operations in other countries such as Nigeria , the arms sales by Member States to repressive regimes .
If we are looking at real co-development , that will be a major step forward and I welcome that .
I think we should be considering how our open market closed-border policies are assisting the market forces driving the increases in human trafficking .
Mr President , the tragedy at Dover was one of the most appalling incidents that anyone here can recall .
A tragedy for the people involved , a tragedy for their family and friends , but also a tragedy for Europe and the European ideal .
As a European Parliament , we must do everything we can to prevent a recurrence .
This appalling incident was avoidable .
Mr Cappato spoke a few moments ago about the controls at Dover .
But the authorities in Zeebrugge knew that the lorry in question was suspect .
They had never heard of the company on the side of the lorry and the driver paid cash for the ferry .
Accordingly , they alerted the port authorities at Dover .
Had they checked the vehicle in Belgium some of these lives could certainly have been saved .
I thank the Minister for his genuine and honest statement .
He spoke about the real culprits , the organizers .
And of course he is right that we must fight organized crime and global trafficking , but identifying the culprits is only part of the battle .
We must do more to support the countries from which these people came and improve the conditions there .
Can we here in Strasbourg even begin to contemplate the misery and desperation that drove those Chinese people to spend months travelling in clandestine fashion halfway across the world ?
And their prospects ?
Probably to work in Chinese restaurants satisfying Westerners ' desire for Chinese food .
But to do this they died a tragic and desperate death because as Europeans we failed to come up with common and workable procedures for asylum and immigration and that must be on all our consciences .
Mr President , I would like to thank the President-in-Office and the Commissioner for their words and to add my voice to the many who have expressed their shock and horror at this tragic loss of life discovered in Dover .
The committee which I have the honour to chair has repeatedly made clear its view that we need a European immigration policy .
This tragedy involving those so desperate to reach our shores - and it is of course no isolated incident - throws into sharp relief the lack of an immigration policy .
We know that the numbers trying to come to our continent are not in fact increasing over time .
It is simply that as the legal avenues have closed , so the private sector has moved in to exploit the illegal avenues .
Last year 's summit in Tampere gave a mandate to the Commission to start moving towards a common policy and I understand from my meeting last week with Mr Chevenement , President-in-Office of the Justice and Home Affairs Council , that the French presidency will launch initiatives to deal with the persons involved , to deal with the transporters of these victims .
The European Parliament looks forward to being consulted on these initiatives .
But these are not enough .
How long will it take for governments to realize that they have no clothes in this matter ?
How long will it take for them to realize that the criminals are so far ahead of them , and to develop the methods of police cooperation which will put an end to this vile trafficking ?
I am even tempted to suggest that they might use things like the Echelon system to start fighting against these traffickers , but that might be rather provocative in view of the vote coming up on Thursday .
The fact is that we should be proud that we have developed a society which is so attractive that people wish to come and join us , but we
