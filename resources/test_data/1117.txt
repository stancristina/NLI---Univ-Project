, the WTO is the main imperialist mechanism which imposes the terms of the multinationals and the full liberalisation and opening of the markets on international trade .
New players are appearing and claiming a place in the game .
It is clear from the interview with Mr Lamy that he intends to sacrifice even more and I am waiting for an answer to the question of how far he will go .
We all agree that efficient trans-European networks linking eastern and western Europe and northern and southern Europe need to be created , we all agree that the issue of traffic congestion needs to be addressed , we all agree that emphasis needs to be given to the environment and to more friendly means of transport and we all agree that greater emphasis needs to be given to the railways .
Because , without liberalisation and without interoperability in the network , it is obvious that the railways , which are the most environmentally-friendly , will never be able to acquire the required momentum .
Consequently , on numerous occasions you see that we make plans on paper .
In a few days ' time , no doubt , the European Commission will come along and tell us that it is proposing a new plan reforming the trans-European network guidelines .
Consequently , we need to see how the Member States can assume their responsibilities and how the Union budget will fund the European networks more substantially and what role the European Investment Bank can play in this direction .
Mr President , Mr Perry has drafted a report and has presented certain elements of the Lloyd 's case to us .
That our concern at this moment in time is not the substance of the matter , nor are we a court .
Our concern at this moment in time is this , and only this : after five years of reports , we want to maintain the credibility of our committee and , consequently , our problem is whether we shall receive a definitive answer as to the extent to which the directive was or was not applied .
The Lloyd 's issue came to the Committee on Petitions with petitions from citizens .
That the two twin rights , of accusation and petition , are interlinked .
As , therefore , we are all interested in reinforcing the participation of the European citizen , I think we should give some emphasis to this debate and I even think that we should declare the day of the debate in Parliament to be the day of the European citizen .
However , we do not know at this moment who is right .
Could it not shorten this period of time so that we too are more credible in the eyes of the European citizens who come and say to us , it has been eighteen months and we have not had a reply ?
However , the problem remains , as my honourable friend Mr Koukiadis has highlighted in such a proper and constructive manner , that we do not have clear answers to the following : the British government was obviously very late in transposing into national legislation the directive which should also have applied in Great Britain to the issue of the private insurance which would also cover the Lloyd 's case .
Thus , many of them were ruined , we are talking about huge assets , while despair led some of them to suicide .
Thus , we cannot form a clear and full picture of exactly how this complex affair stands and to what extent there is responsibility by reason of negligence and/or abuse on the part of the British government as the result of delay , imperfect transposition and erroneous application of the directives on private insurance .
Thus , all means are being used to promote the creation of conditions of demand and consumption of arms , by fomenting tension , armed clashes and massacres of or infighting among peoples .
That is why Mr Solana proposes increasing the military forces .
Like all the previous reports , it formulates wishes and proposals which will never be applied .
We support them , which is why we shall not vote for the report .
Nonetheless , this woman will not cease to symbolise the fight of all women the length and breadth of the planet , who are fighting for protection of their fundamental freedoms and human rights .
Another Greek sage and rhetorician , Antiphontas , also said that people subjected to torture only say what pleases their torturers .
Acts of violence and terrorism , the fear and insecurity which were once confined to certain corners of the planet became a daily reality in many other areas , including in the western world .
We realised it when we saw Afghan prisoners with masks covering their eyes and ears in gaol on the American base in Guantanamo in Cuba , under conditions which were tantamount to torture in accordance with the opinion of one expert , Maria Kalli , the Greek president of the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims to whom you referred .
Unfortunately , the war against terror has turned into a war against freedom , against the freedom to travel in safety , to walk in the street , to meet people and to lead a daily life without fear and terror .
From this point of view , I congratulate you on any initiatives you take .
Anyone who failed to leave the Communist Party of Latvia eight months before the break-up of the Soviet Union does not have the right to stand for election or to work in the public sector .
The and its editor are being threatened with muzzling and this is a serious blow to the freedom of the press and of expression in the Turkish Cypriot community .
