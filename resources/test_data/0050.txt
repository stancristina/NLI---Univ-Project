In Thessaloniki , ladies and gentlemen , we also discussed immigration policy .
We noted that this sum was available and we then decided to promote coordination and cooperation on guarding the borders , because it is clear that the problem of illegal immigration , as we saw a few weeks ago in Italy , for example , cannot be dealt with by one country alone , given that illegal immigrants come in , for example , by boat and try to disembark in one Mediterranean country or another and there must be overall monitoring of the area .
We decided to proceed to create a common information technology system for issuing visas to third country nationals , which will allow illegal immigrants to be controlled , and we took certain decisions on the integration of immigrants into our societies .
It means that they will have a multiannual , guaranteed , predictable framework of income support similar to that which they enjoy today , as well as large margins as regards their production and business options .
Ladies and gentlemen , as far as foreign relations are concerned , I can report that there was agreement between the Member States of the Union , followed by agreement with the countries of the Western Balkans , confirming the accession prospects of the countries in the region , adopting a new procedure for regular political dialogue and promoting the harmonisation of their legislation with the Community acquis and an important increase in financial support .
And following the United Nations Security Council resolution , there is now a framework for cooperation and we are in constant contact with the United Nations so that we can help with the reconstruction of Iraq within the framework of its resolutions .
A principle was accepted which I believe to be self-evident ; in other words , that we must cooperate for the necessary reasons , for economic , political and security reasons , with the United States .
Our aim was for the European Union to have full operational capability .
At the European Council in Thessaloniki , the report on the strategy to gradually formulate a European defence and security doctrine was presented and discussed .
We are now sitting at the same table and the discussion will show how we can address these issues .
Finally , two issues of immediate interest to the European Parliament were the Interinstitutional Agreement to improve the regulatory environment and , secondly , the regulation on the status of European political parties .
And we had your direct support and cooperation in our work .
As Europeans and as Greeks , we can be proud of this success , however unhappy we are about the incidents of war we had to address .
The Greek Presidency undertook to address both the issue of Iraq and the differences which this war provoked between the Member States of the European Union and between the European Union and the United States .
The European Union is based not only on the principles of democracy , but also on the rejection in principle of war in international relations .
Problems in sensitive areas , such as Cyprus , which the Foreign Ministers in the area have called a sort of powder magazine of the Eastern Mediterranean , were addressed methodically and consistently .
From a wider perspective , it is worth highlighting the guidelines given for the formulation of a new strategy by the European Union , which was worked out down to the last detail by the Council 's High Representative .
The increase in the retirement age , the reduction in pensions , the privatisation of social security and the extension of part-time and temporary employment were promoted .
During the Greek Presidency , the European Union , despite the unprecedented protests of its peoples , found excuses for and ultimately legalised the savage attack by Anglo-American troops and the occupation of Iraq , with its well documented disastrous results for the Iraqi people .
On the pretext of crushing terrorism , further militarisation of the European Union was promoted , by completing the formation of the European army for imperialist interventions all over the world jointly with ? ? ? ? and the USA , as was the more general strengthening of the repressive mechanisms to armour the interests of big business inside and outside the European Union from hostile peoples .
The signature of the enlargement of the European Union marks new hardships for its peoples and legalises the division of Cyprus as a result of the invasion and occupation by the army of Turkey , which is a candidate for accession .
Each of us shall serve his cause .
I shall focus my attention mainly on the issues on which no progress was made , not in order to grumble , but because it is good for us to remember the things that were not done , so that we can put them in order and make progress with them .
Similarly , I would say that the common European asylum system was not introduced and , finally , we have no readmission agreements .
Where is the strength and will of Europe on such an important issue , which has not only economic , but also , more importantly , humanitarian consequences .
For the reform of the CAP , I believe that you realise that the debate on the mid-term review carried out has not been completed , in that a series of products have not been included in the decisions .
With duality ?
Double structures ?
Under these conditions , how will the interest of countries and , above all , their citizens , be maintained ?
Those which we do not dare refer to expressly in the preamble to the Constitutional Treaty , offering the citizens - whose support we crave - the political education and values
