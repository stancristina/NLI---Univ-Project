have to re-sit and who are penalised by a year in some cases because of that .
To explain my votes , I would first say that the right to equal treatment and protection against discrimination is a fundamental human right .
That figure is obviously inadequate given the actions envisaged .
The proposal covers both direct and indirect discrimination .
The resolution is not seeking to reduce arms sales radically to promote a policy of disarmament , but just to regulate them in order to guarantee greater profits for the industrial groups .
Also , television programme filtering devices must be sold at prices affordable to all .
She spells out the difficulties of operating at Community level , when every Member State has its own history and its own special relationship with its national television .
Gender disparity is also prevalent when it comes to wages and salaries .
Thanks to this motion for a resolution , which has found broad consensus , Parliament is taking a firm position .
Massoud is seen as a war leader , but how could it be otherwise after so many battles ?
But I want to join previous speakers in emphasising two concerns .
The Commission should also take much stronger emergency humanitarian measures for the people , doing everything possible to enable the NGOs to provide aid to Afghan women and involve them in their activities .
That requires special training , standard now for soldiers in European Union armies , because we are lucky enough to be at peace .
So , negotiations should concentrate on the possibility of making the most sensitive areas neutral , and why not revive the proposal made here on 2 September by the Chairman of the Palestinian Legislative Council , Mr Ahmed Qurie ?
The Palestinian leaders are in a no-win situation .
Yesterday , the European Central Bank raised its intervention rates by a quarter of a point , which led to a further fall in the euro ' s value .
Otherwise , Madam President , in yielding to the authority of others , you are effectively taking a step backwards .
The European Parliament resolution on the social agenda which you are just about to adopt is a very ambitious contribution to our joint exercise .
It is a false line of reasoning to set quantity off against quality , and Lisbon clearly established a twofold objective : more jobs and better jobs .
You can count on me to make every effort to complete the task successfully and to support the financial commitment of EUR 50 million .
The agenda could also give an opinion on the follow up to be given to the 1992 recommendation on minimum resources .
We support Anne Van Lancker and Mrs PÃ©ry when they propose to quickly adopt the 1998 directive on employee information and consultation and to revise the European Works Council Directive .
The rapporteur effectively asks the Commission to intensify the agenda , chiefly in the following areas : Employment , with the framing of a European pact for employment and social cohesion , as concerns lifelong training and the introduction of prior cross-border testing of social and fiscal legislation .
This is all a specific encouragement to go beyond laudable intentions and actually take practical action .
In this area , as in many others , it is essential for public authorities to exercise true pluralism in selecting their associates .
The Commission has produced an excellent text .
The revision of GMO Directive No 90/220 is at the conciliation stage right now .
It now needs to be revised to take into account developments in phytosanitary regulations and scientific and technical progress , particularly in the field of in vitro propagation .
Personally , I find the ' 68 vintage rather a fine one , but apparently the Commission has decided to modernise .
In so doing , you protect what goes on in your own region , but rule out the grafting of hardwood cuttings in the winter period , even though this is the grafting technique that is the most widely used in Europe .
However , everything was done exactly by the book , and in conformity with the Rules of Procedure .
Next , tangible progress was made on qualified majority voting and closer cooperation .
Having said that , I must admit that not a great deal was actually said , because there remains a very marked rift over how this is to be achieved .
I will now turn to international issues , which were also very much to the fore at Biarritz .
Lastly , and I will end here - this is without doubt the most important decision in the medium and long term - the Union has decided to provide this country with a political prospect by proposing that it conclude a stabilisation and association agreement along the lines of those currently being negotiated with the other countries in the same region .
These divergences of opinion are a fact .
That is my first point .
It is interesting to note that many delegations feel that we have to turn this progress on closer cooperation to good account , and this is along the lines of what I was saying earlier , in order to strengthen the role of the Community institutions - the role of the Commission , but also that of Parliament .
This is what has caused the European Union to radically alter its policy in respect of Serbia .

Concerning the Middle East , all the signs following Sharm-el-Sheikh are that the peace process depends on certain undertakings being honoured , beginning with the full and comprehensive implementation of the UN resolutions , an end to Israeli colonisation of the occupied territories , the right of displaced Palestinians to return to their lands , and the recognition of a Palestinian state which has East Jerusalem as its capital .
