In my opinion , journalists are very much in a position to determine from specific cases in practice whether prior knowledge applies .
I support , therefore , the recommendation for a second reading by Mr Goebbels .
The maximum percentage for co-financing will be increased from 10 % to 20 % and from now on the construction phase will take precedence .
Support of tangible projects such as off-shore wind parks should therefore be encouraged .
Mr President , I propose adding the words ' Pakistan and Russia ' to the word ' Israel ' .
Though one might argue that airlines should seek recourse against those actually responsible in such cases , this will be very complicated in practice .
It is nice that the Liberal party still wants to add a charitable slant to this poor position but it does not change the effect .
If free trade is implemented , this will mean survival of the fittest .
Technically speaking there are vast sources of CO2 emissions and CO2 wells .
With regard to CO2 wells I would like to point out the danger that we might overestimate in our accounting for CO2 wells in , for example , the ocean .
How do the Commissioners feel about this ?
Of the four names mentioned , for example , two at least would be considered to be generally used as first names .
For let there be no misunderstanding with regard to Europe 's position towards Iran .
The extreme nature of the sharia represents an insurmountable obstacle for normal relations .
Unfortunately the Iranian authorities do not know how to handle the situation .
I find that the motion for a resolution placed before us for our vote is not sufficiently clear .
They are fighting a corrupt regime which owns 95 % of the country 's wealth .
We do not think that this is acceptable and we ask your support otherwise we will not be able to endorse this resolution , at least as far as I am concerned .
The Flemish Greens clearly state that the conditions for supply are not fulfilled and our party will continue to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Belgian Parliament whether it is still possible to suspend the planned supply of weapons .
In this sense , this resolution is a more than obvious sign to Mr Michel of a poor , incoherent document .
We are excited about it and would like to congratulate the Commission and the Council on this .
Also , could you indicate the principal difference between referendums in the current Member States and those in the states that are candidates for membership ?
I am also pleased that the Dutch Government did not put a spanner in the works .
Thanks to enlargement , we will be getting new neighbours , countries that are also knocking on the doors of the EU.
Victims among the civilian population are always unacceptable , whether they are at the hands of suicide attacks or the army .
Payments to the Palestinians must also be resumed so that European money can once again be used for development projects in education and care rather than payment support .
What we need is not war as a reflex response but to bring massive pressure to bear on Saddam Hussein via weapons inspections .
Given our position , this is wrong .
Europe can and must play an executive role in this .
We must not forget that suicide bombers will never be stamped out by military force or military occupation .
If high land prices mean that young farmers are then unable to take over businesses , we have overshot the mark .
I would like to say straight away that these points are nothing new .
The European Union cannot continue to inject money into that region while that is going on .
Secondly , it is clear again , from all the elections , how important it is for the media to be independent .
I only have to point out that we are sitting here in a Chamber that is almost empty .
Many small businesses have grown in its place but have not been able to solve the problem of unemployment and there are absolutely no prospects for large sections of the population .
A genuine change of direction has to take place and this has to happen quickly .
Meanwhile , the local elections of 26 October in Kosovo offered little encouragement as regards the Serbian contribution .
( NL ) I am in favour of enlargement but against this resolution because I regret the absence of a critical approach to various areas .
Finally , we are still waiting for the reforms to the disastrous agricultural policy .
Recent agreements between Germany and France do by no means serve this purpose .
This resolution does not sufficiently emphasise the need for far-reaching reforms and settles for the marginal reforms before us .
European agricultural subsidies deprive farmers in developing countries of the ability to compete with their European counterparts .
The Senegalese relatives and all the relatives from France , the Netherlands and other Member States cannot live with the dreadful thought that their loved ones could not be given a dignified send-off .
Could I ask you , Mr President , to write to the Members of this Parliament who do not attend the conference about the contacts you had and what you discussed with the prime ministers , so that we too are well equipped for the task ahead and know what we are talking about in the plenary meeting on 4 December .
For a fee , the organisation Trees for Travel plants trees after each plane trip you make .
Yes , of course it is .
Last month , an overwhelming majority of people in this House voted in favour of banning advertising for pharmaceutical products , but ,
