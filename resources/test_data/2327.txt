Commission , as guardian of the Treaties , has to ensure that Community law is fully respected and applied .
Events following the abduction of the Israeli soldier and Israel 's reprisals are , on the one hand , harming the Palestinians as a political entity , with their representatives , be they ministers or parliamentarians , being abducted and with citizens ' being deprived of passports and residency rights , and are impoverishing the entire nation , given that bridges , schools and pumping and electricity stations are being bombed and set on fire , on the other .
We have exchanged views with the European Commission within the framework of the White Paper , and in a resolution adopted by a large majority the European Parliament maintained that our merchant fleet , in the competitive and rapidly developing international environment , needs a clear framework for manoeuvre which must guarantee fair and healthy competition .
We called for care to be taken to ensure that the market was not sent into shock by the European Commission 's proposals and for gradual and creative adaptation to the new circumstances .
I agree with the rapporteur that cabotage should not be exempted from free competition .
These are similar in form but less advanced than the pools of chemical shipping companies which were set up later .
Shipping conferences were developed for the transportation of raw materials and in international trade in general , mainly between the northern European shore and shipping monopolies , and they secured huge , astronomical profits for euro-unifying capital .
Typically , one European container transport company operates 550 ships while , by contrast , a similar Asian company operates 112 ships .
Of course , the Council and the European Commission , in collusion with employers , are pushing them towards the European Court of Justice .
The point is that they will have to face them because the workers are not prepared to sell out their rights .
Maintaining the exemption of maritime transport conducted solely between ports of the same Member State from the application of the competition rules is of strategic importance to the economic development , social cohesion and national defence of these countries .
Maritime transport is a social necessity which cannot be satisfied within the framework of an anti-grassroots competition policy .     Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mrs Lucas and thank her for her report .
This rate of increase in carbon dioxide is , of course , helping to exacerbate the greenhouse effect and it should be noted that it is not only carbon dioxide which aircraft emit ; there are other side effects , such as emissions which help to create other greenhouse gases and , as such , the contribution of aviation to the greenhouse effect is much greater than the 3 % reported for carbon dioxide .
In other words , we do not want the other sectors to fare worse than aviation .
The Commission has taken a different approach : it considers that the broader the scope of the trading system , the less it will cost to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and , as a result , aviation will have lower costs without reducing the benefit to the environment .
The Commission is continuing and will continue its efforts towards third countries , in accordance with what you too said earlier , in order to abolish this tax exemption for kerosene , which clearly does not have positive environmental results .
Finally , I should like to say that , without doubt , in addition to including aviation in the trading system , there are other measures , such as those you mention : improvement of air traffic , investment in research , so that more environmentally-friendly technologies can be developed , improved and used , the possible use of biofuels in airlines – although this last option is still at the research stage – and a series of other measures which can be applied in parallel in order to mitigate the impact of aviation on climate change .     Mr President , I thank the Members of Parliament for their very important speeches and for their contribution to this evening 's debate .
I should also like to say that there is excellent cooperation between the European Union and the International Civil Aviation Organization .
In all events , the action we are examining will not contradict the European Union 's commitments towards the International Civil Aviation Organization , given that the Civil Aviation Organization itself is in favour of an open system of emissions trading ; in other words , it has accepted that emissions from international aviation will come under the current national systems of emissions trading rights .
The European Union accounts for approximately 50 % of total carbon dioxide emissions by international aviation , compared with Annex I countries , in other words countries which have restrictions in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol .
This is not the case ; there is no such risk because , under the Commission proposal , the trading system will cover all airlines operating flights in the geographical area , within the geographical scope of the system , irrespective of nationality .
The few outstanding matters have been settled satisfactorily , which is why the Commission supports the conciliation text .
The discussions in the conciliation committee were constructive and moved in the right direction , thanks also to the efforts of the Austrian Presidency , and agreement was reached on numerous important matters , as Mr Blokland mentioned : the possibility of removing accumulators from appliances , the exemption for very small battery producers , capacity labelling on batteries and other important matters to which positive solutions were found .
