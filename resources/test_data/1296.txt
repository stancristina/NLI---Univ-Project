Ideally , they should be phased out straight away .
We shall try to choose both routes .
It is an important report for the environment , but it also addresses a major and important consumer issue because detergents are important items of daily use .
In Amendments Nos 40-46 , now being tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance , we take as our starting point the Scientific Committee’s statement that phosphates cause major problems and that the existing alternatives do not cause these problems .
Twenty thousand deaths per day or more than seven million deaths per year are horrific figures .
In the light of , for example , the UN’s millennium objectives and the G8 Summit in Evian on sustainable development , I want to say to Mr Nielson that no effort should be spared in helping people hit by malaria , tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS , and in preventing these diseases .
What is needed is a society marked by a new and more potent dispensation in which men show respect for women and for human dignity .
I want to take paragraph 26 of Mrs Sandbaek’s report , which is very central , as my starting point .
Written off debts could also be earmarked so that they are , in the first place , used for efforts to combat HIV/AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis and perhaps also for education .
You have not only your own problems to deal with , but also some of the problems created by the previous Presidency .
Now , we expect some plain speaking to be directed to Russia on this fundamental issue of human rights for the civilian population of Chechnya .
Here too , there is a need for plain language on the part of the EU.
You would have done well to have gone a little further in this area .
For example , you could have mentioned the importance of quickly obtaining sound chemicals legislation and of cooperating with Parliament on this issue .
This has been the EU’s pet area of concern for a long time , and care needs to be taken over it .
The currency union and the Stability and Growth Pact face a serious economic and political crisis .
It is a new European Union that , in six months ’ time , you will hand over to the next country to hold the Presidency .
In spite of what was said at the last EU-Russia summit , I now appeal to you and the Irish Presidency to make use of the confidence you enjoy and to exploit the European Union’s growing importance by taking the initiative to promote a genuine peace dialogue between the parties involved in the war in Chechnya with a view to bringing the atrocities to an end .
It is a modern form of colonialism .
Swedish elk stocks are stable , while hunting is carried on in such a way that the species is not in decline , still less threatened with extinction .
We therefore believe it to be of the greatest importance both to confirm in international law that every state or group of states has a legitimate right freely to decide what cultural policy they wish to pursue , and to strengthen the policy of international cooperation and solidarity on cultural issues .
Without doubt , there is a lot of xenophobia and racism in our societies or , in any case , a fear of that which comes from outside .
I can speak from my own experience .
We should not have had the prosperity we enjoy today if these people , together with the rest of us , had not contributed to it .
Europe must be a refuge for people being persecuted and in danger of being killed in other countries .
We must have a humane refugee policy for which we take joint responsibility .
It is something they do already , and there will be a greater need for them to do so in the future .
Unfortunately , the fact is that people who at present come from other countries become , in large measure , unemployed , and that is something we naturally should do something about .
That applies especially to women , as Mrs Dybkjaer mentioned .
They went to the polls in very large numbers .
I wish at the same time to express my pleasure and satisfaction at the fact that Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou , as rapporteur , and the committee as a whole have so kindly dealt with the many amendments I put forward .
Secondly , the European Parliament should call upon the Member States to develop and stimulate the support and household-related service sector in order to make it easier to combine working life and family life , especially in the light of the European Union’s having identified the demographic challenge as one of its most important issues for the future .
Such improvements are necessary in the light of future needs in , for example , the health and health care sectors , as well as in order to increase these groups ’ participation and integration in the labour market and in the social community .
This may be compared with the figure of four per cent for violence in the workplace and two per cent for sexual harassment .
Because there was a clear link between this problem and stress and tension in the workplace .
We now see a change when it comes to the organisation of working life .
Commissioner , I share your view when you say that it is now important to make contact with both sides of industry .
It is also true that it is important to use a wide range of instruments , because the legal instrument is not enough .
This is an opportunity to do just that .
Because this is a Community area , involving health and safety in the workplace
