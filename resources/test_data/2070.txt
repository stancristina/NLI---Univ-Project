it is also true that he has worked under tremendous time pressure so that we would be able to table a first draft at the Vienna summit .
Some of us have fought for years for this common statute , but it was never our aim to sacrifice everything in order to achieve a common statute at any price .
We must not claim equality with category B2 Community officials , agreeable though they may be in other respects .
I believe that as a democratic body , it is our duty to show particular sensitivity towards any criticism offered in good faith .
Likewise , however , we must disregard attacks motivated by anti-European sentiments which aspire to discredit the European Parliament and the European Union 's other institutional bodies .
And we are prepared to continue our fight unwaveringly on that basis .
But now , the word 'competitive ' is being added .
Competitiveness is ranked above all else , and the rights and acquisitions of working people , the environment and a balanced ecology are all placed in thrall to it .
Indeed , I could add that the Commission is one of the best bureaucracies I know .
Anything else , I repeat , is rhetoric and blackmail .
For the first time , we have been inundated by special reports from the Court of Auditors denouncing malpractices and irregularities in the Commission 's administration , and giving the figures .
Commissioner , I doubt whether you will be able to achieve what you will promise us here , in good faith , to do .
I think such a development is quite unacceptable , and that is why at present I believe that refusal to grant discharge would strengthen the hand of those who desire it - the majority of the Commission - so that they can set about internal restructuring .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , let me remind you that the Council 's commitment two years ago , when we were debating the 1997 budget , was that the 1997 budget would be the last austerity budget .
I know what is going to happen now .
Therefore I will not vote in favour of this budget .
And those who elected you should ask you how you can maintain and say one thing and in the end vote for something else , and how you can issue ideological manifestos with a view to the coming elections containing false promises that you know you cannot fulfil so long as the budget remains at 1.10 .
Yet , Madam Commissioner , as you too are aware , the phenomenon persists and is constantly on the increase .
I think there may be accusations and that , as the custodian of the Treaties , the Commission can do that .
I even hear the name Lenin mentioned in this hallowed Chamber .
As the rapporteur rightly observes , it is most unlikely that zero deficits will be achieved in the next few years .
If public investments are to be governed by the stability pact , then either there will be no room for the automatic stabilisers to operate , or there will be no room for public investment , or public investment will have to be financed by higher taxation , which would be a recipe for madness - as indeed the entire stability pact is a recipe for madness - at a time when economic activity in Europe is on the decline .
But where are we to find that 'audace ' when we have all subjugated our reasoning to irrational monetarism which is leading us straight towards disaster unless we react against it ?
We had expected and , if you will , we still expect in future to see more resistance from the government of Austria , a country rich in history , culture and traditions but one that does not suffer from the complex that affects major powers and does not feel that it is the subsidiary of some major power in the European Union .
At least in its debates , the European Parliament has always shown sensitivity about human rights .
As Mr Roubatis indeed stresses , human rights are an inseparable part of the Union 's foreign policy and that must be grasped by all its bodies and at all levels .
Mr President there is no doubt that the reports we are debating contain very important and interesting ideas on human rights .
In my opinion , an example suffices to demonstrate the extent of the hypocrisy that exists .
Well !
Mr President , in the suffocatingly short time allotted to me for so broad and critical a subject , I can only stress one point in the detailed and pragmatic report by Mr Roubatis .
The European Union can and must become a protagonist in the worldwide imposition of respect for these existentialist values .
Her answer was very extensive and covered all the necessary points , and perhaps that is why it is difficult for me to put a second question .
Mr President , in essence I wish to return to the supplementary by Mrs McIntosh .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , for the umpteenth time the European Parliament is expressing its revulsion at the fact that anachronistic and mediaeval methods of questionable efficacy are still being used for the punishment of convicts , and this indeed , in countries that wish to be regarded as modern and democratic , such as the United States of America .
In Pennsylvania , 87 % of those convicted during 1998 were black .
Finally , the European Commission and the Council must insist on the abolition of the death penalty by inserting a special clause in the economic and political agreements they conclude with third countries , to promote an immediate worldwide moratorium on executions until the death penalty is eventually abolished in every country in the world .
