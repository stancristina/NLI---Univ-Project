clearly carved out what we want from the budget for the European Union in the next year at a very early stage - before the summer recess .
We shall also be given its decision , but is that enough of a solution ?
That is the most natural thing in the world .
Defending the acquis communautaire means not having to modernise or change , but in this case it is obvious that the matter of the size of the political groups in Parliament must now be dealt with .
That is the case today because , otherwise , the public might be interested in why a report that was rejected by the committee should come to this plenary session .
However , I also agree with those who have said that Parliament has increasingly developed from being an advisory assembly to a legislative body .
Congratulations to Mr Corbett for knuckling down time and again to further develop Parliament .
We also call on all littoral states around the Baltic Sea - all nine , including Russia - to be fully consulted and also to be fully involved in the maintenance and security of such a pipeline were it to be constructed .
However , there are also negative aspects to report , such as the fact that the growing of opium poppies has now reached record levels nationwide and that this crop has become increasingly linked to the general economy as well as to the escalating levels of crime and corruption and to the activities of the insurgent groups .
I should like to express my thanks to my colleagues from the other political groups , to the Commission - and Commissioner you have a wonderful team in Kabul and in Brussels dealing with the Afghanistan problem - and to the Council 's Special Representative , as well as to the many Afghan and international NGOs that have been involved .
The Commission has committed EUR 1.2 billion from 2002-2007 .
My Group will recommend that everyone reads the original report produced by Mr Brie so that they will understand the nature of the challenges facing us in Afghanistan .
Secondly , many colleagues and fellow Members have said to me that we need to shoulder our responsibilities towards Afghanistan when it comes to dealing with terrorism , opium growing , corruption and so on .
It particularly appeals to me personally that we should focus support on those who use environmentally-friendly means of transport such as trains and buses , for they too are suffering from the high oil prices and , compared with the airlines , sometimes have to cope with all kinds of different taxes , which in my country also means having to pay an ecotax .
This is not on .
With this compromise we have succeeded in stopping the trend in the aviation sector .
However , I am pleased that we have kept our feet on the ground .
I do not know if that also happened in the speaker 's group , but in any case for us it was all very open and above board , even on an internal level .

Hitherto Switzerland and Liechtenstein have maintained a privileged partnership with the EU through various bilateral agreements , which is something that could certainly be commended to any state that wishes to preserve its sovereignty and its identity .
Still on this particular subject I would again express sincere thanks to my colleague Mr Buzek .
I would say this now here in this debate and at this particular time .
There has been some very good collaboration between the rapporteur , Mr La Russa , and the various shadow rapporteurs .
This would also be left to individual countries .
Fourthly , we have a weak European regulatory system , which means multinational concerns and national regulatory authorities that always end up coming second best .
We cannot step back from our commitment to provide an open environment for investment .
The Commission will monitor this closely , though there are as yet no plans to carry out a detailed audit .
This strengthens our argument and it is important that we maintain this whatever happens .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I really want to thank you once again for the broad support you have given to the Commission 's approach in the course of this debate .
So we must proceed carefully and cautiously in promoting the ERTMS version .
That applies above all to Internet offers .
Let me put it quite plainly : local and regional authorities that have already tackled the problems of organising transport do not need the Green Paper , while local and regional authorities that have hitherto refused to address this issue will not be more likely to do so as a result of the Green Paper or our resolution .
Urban traffic is responsible for around 40 % of all CO2 emissions and 70 % of all greenhouse gases .
There are three questions that I hope the Commissioner can answer .
These new requirements for the transportation by aeroplane of small children will be entering into force at the end of next week .
This speed and effectiveness are evidence of strong action , based on competence and greater trust in your institution .
We need to ensure that we really ward off that risk at an early stage .
As the rapporteur has said , the purpose of the regulation is coordination , not harmonisation , for which we in the EU do not in any case have any legal basis .
Batteries and accumulators and their waste ( 8.
You talk about the state of play of the negotiations .
The Chinese Communist Party is prevailing .
