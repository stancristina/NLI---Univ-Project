Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I would like to congratulate Mr Evans on his wonderful report and point out once again the large extent to which we have agreed on analysing the reforms of Community competition law as a whole , as well as the social consequences of competition .
There is no doubt whatsoever that the competition rules included in the Treaty , and in the law derived from it , have contributed significantly to the growth of a culture of competition , and have been fundamental to the creation of the single market .
I must add here that it is no surprise that Mr Evans ' assessment and concern does not coincide exactly with that of his colleague in the Group of the European People ' s Party , Mr Karas .
In the field of vertical restrictions , the new regulations on exemption by category and the guidelines for their application have been approved .
I would therefore ask you to vote in favour of these amendments .
We started from very different positions .
In terms of the budget , we should be pleased that , after the restrictions which , in general , have resulted from the plans for reconstruction in Kosovo , we now have a contribution of EUR 249 million , having started with an initial Council proposal of EUR 9 million , for a period of 6 years , from now until 2006 .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the increase in poverty , despite the gradual growth of world GDP over recent decades , the current tendency of Member States to reduce the funds intended for official aid to development in favour of direct investment , of which only 1 % goes to the least-developed countries - which increases the gulf which separates those countries from the rich or developing countries - and the conviction that the globalisation process may increase the difficulties of the poor countries , are all factors which demonstrate the urgent need to improve the effectiveness of policies on development cooperation .
That is why we must take a positive view of the Commission ' s presentation of the communication on the complementarity of Community and Member States ' policies on development cooperation , since the measures it proposes may contribute to removing the obstacles which hinder significant advances in this area .
Thirdly , I must say that it will be difficult for measures to strengthen complementarity , alone , to achieve the desired results .
It has not been possible , and we regret this because the truth is , Commissioner , that on this matter you are not alone .
We are failing to use a mechanism which would to such a large extent maximise the resources , which are becoming scarcer , dedicated to aid as the political result of a joint effort , despite the repeated requests of this Parliament and the repeated resolutions of the Council itself , which basically has ultimate responsibility in this area .
As has been said before , the States must overcome their individual tendencies - which often reflect their concerns about former colonial relationships or other factors - and commit themselves to a common European project .
Mr President , the fine report which my compatriot , Mrs Ferrer , is presenting us with today addresses a problem which has been highlighted on numerous occasions and , at the same time , the urgent need to resolve it and open up new avenues in the relations between the united Europe and the third world .
This situation was naturally unsustainable and was one more problem to resolve , but that need has become all the more blatant and urgent given that the very process of European construction , the reforms and the progress of the Union , are making it essential that we act on the international stage as one country , with one voice , and given that it is an undeniable priority for the viability of our project that we implement a common foreign and security policy .
Mr President , this proposal relates to an extremely delicate area .
Mr Souchet has produced a wonderful report , and I congratulate him on his work as rapporteur .
On the contrary , there has been intense and fruitful debate between the members of the Committee , as well as people from the academic world and all the interested parties .
As for the consumer , it is proposed that the scope of the special system be extended to those who sign contracts at a distance within the internal market with no distinction whatsoever between directed and undirected activities and , as the rapporteur has highlighted , it incorporates the extrajudicial resolution of disputes into the regulation .
After more than one year of discussion in the Committee on Legal Affairs , I can say simply that the arguments levelled against its report lack foundation and are more the result of intimidation and demagoguery than of basic reasoning .
It is precisely for this reason , Mr President , that the Committee on Legal Affairs requires strict conditions of transparency .
In conclusion , Mr President , it seems to me that in this field of judicial cooperation Parliament must send a clear signal to the Council and the Commission that it will not accept being sidelined or manipulated by dogmatic arguments that represent purely nationalist interests .

Since then , the Basque people have had the opportunity , on six occasions , to elect the representatives for their autonomous parliament and violent and radical nationalism has never won the democratic support of the Basque people at the polls .
We all doubtless agree that dialogue is a decisive factor in the democratic process .
Today , thanks to this debate , they are a little
