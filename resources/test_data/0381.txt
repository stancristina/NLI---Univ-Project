Parliament .
This is not a strategy , it is even less than existing policy in a pleasant format .
This is why it should be binned , and the large majority of my group will support the amendment of the Liberals to reject the common position .
This is why this is a defeat for politics and for European environmental policy .
Partly because many Member States have failed to implement environmental legislation , the objectives of the Fifth EAP have not been achieved .
At the moment , such inspection is difficult to implement outside national borders due to varying regulations and documents .
In addition , Parliament was of the opinion that the data to be included in the attestation should also comprise the driver ' s licence number and social security number .
Both recognise the nub and urgency of the problem : non-EU drivers .
I would therefore like to recommend that , together with the Commissioner ' s pledge , it be adopted without any amendments .
I should also like to congratulate Mr Grosch on his report .
We are unable to back the majority of the amendments because they would , in fact , render the regulation superfluous and the exam ineffective , and we should thus be overshooting our target .
I should like to finish off with a word of thanks to rapporteur Hatzidakis and , obviously , Mr Grosch .
Unfortunately , things are not as simple as that .
At least as important is preventing the abuse of power and human rights violations .
The fact that a number of inconsistencies have survived in the Cotonou Agreement and the unwillingness to reduce underdevelopment if this means abandoning self-interest put the rapporteur in a sombre mood regarding the outcome of the development project .
Furthermore , conflicts of interest may arise between the various countries in their more or less artificially divided regions .
Meanwhile , even those with an economic interest recognise the danger of the oceans being emptied of their fish stocks , not overnight , but gradually , because the young fish are increasingly given less of a chance of reaching adulthood and of procreating .
In low-traffic urban areas and on narrow , winding country roads , they can pose risks for passing cyclists and pedestrians alike .
Recommendation for second reading by Mr Van Dam ( A5-0469/2001 )
We have had to wait for too long for the introduction of a driver ' s attestation showing the driving licence number and social security number of the person concerned .
This is a noble-minded enterprise , to which I , as a Liberal , give my unqualified support .
Even if this is punishable , it appears in practice extremely difficult to prevent such a course of events .
What I welcome in the rapporteur ' s proposals is the fact that in the case of relatively small contracts , authorities are relieved of the European procurement obligations that are expensive and opaque to them , that employment for disadvantaged groups can be safeguarded , that environmental criteria will play a greater role and that people convicted of financial malpractice will be excluded from procurement .
The number of hours of training now to be prescribed - a minimum 210 hours and a maximum of 630 hours - is lower than is already required in some Member States .
Trips to the moon have been a thing of the past for a long time , and further space discoveries can also be made from Earth , thanks to ever improved telescopes .
Allow me to start my contribution in this full Chamber by explaining that my group considers it to be a positive development that a lack of boundaries does not lead to impunity .
Well , this brings me back to what I have been saying all along about drafting minimum standards in the field of penal and criminal procedures law .
After all , the European Council of Tampere subscribed to the principle of mutual recognition within the European Union in criminal matters with good reason .
I doubt whether that is true .
I particularly support the rapporteur ' s proposal that use be made of the contact points of the European judicial network and no new contact points set up .
I think it good that this should happen in this case , and I have the impression that the Commission is also willing to comment .
Mr President , I shall try to make myself understood , despite the noise .
Neither in the framework decision , nor in the proposal did we want to include a decision on whether certain drugs should be legalised or not , and neither did we want to draw a distinction between certain soft and hard drugs .
Even within the Dutch political spectrum , I am not one of the extremists , but rather a moderate , on this score .
In Amendment No 37 , the idea that we will not focus on the prosecution of addicts is broadened to also include users .
I would really advise against adopting these amendments in the strongest terms .
As the Commission rightly underlines in its proposal , the responsibility for combating illegal drug trafficking lies first and foremost with the Member States .
Cultural differences and the different prosecution policies of the Member States , combined with the principle of subsidiarity , provide good reason for restricting this proposal to organised and cross-border illegal drug trafficking .
It is not only in the Netherlands that soft drugs are tolerated .
In all honesty , I happen to be pleased with this cautious approach by the Commission .
At best , they will complicate implementation of the decision .
If we hit these people where it really hurts , namely in their wallets , this will be far more effective than stiff custodial sentences .
