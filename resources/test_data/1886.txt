now has it reached the top of the agenda , as the Commissioner responsible for immigration has stated that there will only be 100 000 refugees entering the Union each year in ten , fifteen years ' time , which means that an average-sized industrialised country will only be receiving 5000 and industry , in particular , will be complaining of the lack of immigrants .
Do we actually want to reintroduce asylum for economic and social refugees ?
Moreover , just a few days ago , at Valencia , the Council addressed the issue of immigration , discussing matters belonging to the second pillar within the framework of the major field of action - the third pillar - of justice and home affairs .

In addition , the global economic slowdown is deepening as a result of the events of September 11 2001 , exacerbating the already severe problems of these communities .
Now , the European Parliament and the Commission , in particular , have firmly upheld the need to cancel this debt , not least in the wake of the Jubilee 2000 campaign in which a range of different political , civil and religious organisations and movements - led by the Holy See - vehemently demanded the complete cancellation of the debt .
Indeed , genuine debt cancellation is now truly the only possible way to give many of the developing countries the chance to find a way out of the spiral of debt , out of what is known as the debt trap , to give these countries the hope of being able to compete on a global market and the practical opportunity to do so , and to give their people a future in which they can genuinely combat poverty , hunger and illness on a practical level .
We are currently talking of first steps , and it is quite absurd to think that we are still , today , at an initial stage , since the call for 0.7 % has been on the table since 1970 and we are now saying that we might be able to achieve 0.3 or 0.31 % , and we do not even know when !
This is clear from the Monterrey Conference too .
The beneficiary countries , for their part , must undertake to establish forms of good government and to channel the money saved through debt alleviation into achieving sufficient standards of fair , sustainable development for their people .
As I voted for this accounting document , then , a thought and a hope popped into my mind : that this money which has not been used in European Union projects should one day be paid into a European pension fund allowing those who live too long - which is considered to be a drain on Member States ' budgets - to receive support from Europe in return for having paid a lifetime 's pension contributions .
Is it a violation of human rights to allow an elderly , sick , retired person to live on a mere EUR 500 per month ?
To set an example , I call upon all the pensioners who travel throughout the world not to go on holiday to countries in which the human rights of the inhabitants are violated .
In this dream , Mrs Martens said : ' God and DNA have laid down through the law of nature that there should be complete equality between men and women . '
Well then , I feel that we should do something to combat this discrimination against women .
Mr President , this is a question of respect for human rights .
The alarm has been raised by a community of sisters - Italian and French nuns - who have been the object of a disturbing increase in unwanted government attention , not least , in recent days .
It is therefore unacceptable for those Members of Parliament who might be considered by some of us to be fascist , communist or radical not to enjoy rights which are available to other Members .
Our meetings have to be public under the Rules of Procedure .
Mrs Torres Marques ' excellent report - in which , moreover , she was willing to include contributions from her fellow Members - which she supports with figures , gives such a good account that there is no need for us to go over the ground again , describing how the tourism sector is not just a sector which is vital , extremely important for the European Union today but also one of the crucial sectors for its future , both in purely economic terms and indirectly , because of its potential to contribute to environmental policies , social policies and policies for promoting peace and awareness between the people of different areas .
It will also be an important year in terms of the Winter Olympics , which will be held subsequently in 2006 in Turin .
Mr President , I cannot do other than congratulate Mr Caudron and lament the fact that this will be the last of the major reports he has drawn up in the European Parliament .
We will have to deal with the selection - for the purposes of genetic improvement - of dozens of embryos produced for that purpose .
Mr President , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , we are faced with an economic situation which is still very uncertain , and the European institutions need to do more than just wait for American recovery and its impact on the European Union economies .
I refer , once again , to investments which could encourage , which could facilitate a policy of active ageing based on the voluntary choice of employees and on the retraining of older workers so as to ensure the endurance of a collective pensions system
