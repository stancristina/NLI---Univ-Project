overwhelming majority of the Austrian population that is defending the great European consensus against deeds and words .
If what we want is for the citizens to say : " Yes , I have a stake in this European project too " , then the Charter of Fundamental Rights can help to bring this about .
On a final note , I would just like to add that we cannot declare at a special summit meeting in Lisbon that full employment should be our political goal , but at the same time , refuse to incorporate social fundamental rights into the Charter .
And so tomorrow , we will be able to adopt a report , which is based on the premise that naturally the European Parliament , and not the national governments , would be responsible for instituting the fundamental rights of the European Union .
It is now the task of twenty-first century Europe to combine the existing fundamental rights in the Member States and those aspects that apply to Europe .
Mr President , Commissioner Barnier , I am extremely pleased that the Commission has produced this initiative .
The Commission intends to apply itself to the most serious of these problems in its draft for the sixth environmental action programme .
I believe the reports that were compiled at the outset , and I still maintain that we must abide by the principle of risk avoidance in this case .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission is unable to give a concrete answer to Mrs Izquierdo Rojo ' s question , at the current stage of negotiations .
Third countries in the Southern Hemisphere , on the other hand , require the Community and shipowners to pay fees .
We must draw a distinction .
Question No 52 by (H-0202/00 ) : Subject : Preventive distillation - increasing the quotas The Commission has opened preventive distillation at 10 million hectolitres for the 1999/2000 wine year .
Mr President , Mr Langen , firstly , if we can give consideration to all the applications submitted by Germany and nearly all the applications submitted by the other Member States regardless , then this would suggest to me to that the balance has largely been restored to the wine market .
Its function , partly in response to the increasing flow of products across borders , is to label products and services which have a high level of environmental compatibility .
Let me make something perfectly clear at this point : this is not a present to the large multinationals , as is being mooted in some quarters , but an important step towards the label exerting a wide influence in the long term .
Take the failed WTO negotiations in Seattle , which have opened our eyes as to the difficulty Europe faces in making itself heard by third countries when it comes to its progressive social and environmental standards .
We need to introduce a system which covers the costs and it is therefore not right at this stage to fix maximum fees , which would seem premature until such time as we know the actual costs involved .
For this reason , our Group rejects the amendments which have been resubmitted by Mr Blokland , the Greens and others .
Many companies are also dependent on the use of waste to retain competitiveness and jobs .
Now to the issues : it is obvious that there are differing opinions in this House on whether the proposal of the European Commission is too ambitious .
I also find it encouraging that the Commission is consequently taking care that EU legislation is being implemented .
Mr President , hearing the debate unfold and watching my colleagues and the clock , I am not sure what I want any more : protected areas for fauna , flora and habitats or protected areas for ecologically minded delegates .
If that were the case , then there would also be areas and matters which you and I would not like .
That was not at all clear .
Mr President , Commissioner , implementation of the flora-fauna-habitats directive is causing quite a stir in many regions and also running into major difficulties .
It appeals to everything which makes man a human being and which makes him aware of his dignity , uniqueness , freedom and equality with other men .
The universality of human rights shows that the degree to which they are applied has become a measure of progress , civilisation and culture in politics and society .
We particularly welcome the fact that the problem of religious freedom was mentioned , as some countries , especially the Czech Republic , have already passed very restrictive laws against religious minorities .
Candidate countries and their Members of Parliament , and I am thinking of many a member of the Turkish parliament , have a great deal to learn , such as how independent representatives of the people act and must act when it comes to human rights in their own country .
The committee spent days discussing them and then voted on a largely amended report and now we have another 69 proposed amendments here in plenary .
I just wonder what that has to do with human rights .
We should therefore voice to the Estonians and Latvians our express recognition of the fact that they have managed to keep a cool head and that they are receptive to our arguments when it comes to adapting their legislation in this area to European standards .
Mr Belder knows that I and the committee wished to quote the specifics of individual problems in candidate countries .
I stand firmly against the way in which racism has been played down , as we have said , to make it a subject of political debate
