must be made between the legal principles of subsidiarity and proportionality on one hand and simplification and consolidation on the other .
These actions pose a double risk : first of all , they could lead to a situation where the general public is inundated with paper , documents , acts , only adding to the bewilderment which currently exists and , secondly , could actually be detrimental to legal security .
Madam President , first of all I wish to express our support for the work carried out by Mrs Palacio because we can also conclude from it that the correct application of the subsidiarity principle should mean bringing European citizens closer to the decision-making process in initiatives leading to the development and consolidation of the European Union .
Mr President , I would like to make a comment on today 's agenda .
The item of today 's agenda on questions to the Commission includes my question on Member States ' laws ' conformity with Community regulations on competence .
However , I must point out that in some cases these roles are not very practical , because in some cases they are just a mere declaration of principles which have not been translated into concrete objectives to be met by farmers and be controlled by the authorities or control bodies .
Congratulations , Mrs Barthet-Mayer .
Ordinary people who want to make complaints feel frustrated and it has to be borne in mind that , according to the Foundation for Wildlife Protection , 80 % of complaints made to the Commission come from ordinary citizens or citizens ' associations .
Yet these built-up areas provide very few jobs and it would be much better in terms of quality and preparation for the future for employment to be created using human resources properly as well as the wealth of the country itself .
The first step will be to foster the creation of aids for small and medium-sized enterprises in the telecommunications sector , which are generators of a high percentage of job creation in Europe , as well as improving the infrastructures which these enterprises install where there is a lack of telecommunications networks and where it is far from convenient to do so .
I have heard it said that preference is given to questions which are related to a particular Commissioner and this is quite right .
Commissioner , you have nearly answered our questions but I would just like to say a couple of things to you and put another question .
Commissioner , referring to the situation of the Spanish businessman , I think you referred to application of legislation which was on the United States Statute Book before the Helms-Burton Act and that , in any case , his defence was a matter solely for the Spanish Government .
I can confirm to you the Commission has been informed that , on 24 April last , a lorry loaded with 21 tonnes of tomatoes was detained and attacked on the motorway between Avignon and Marseille .
In accordance with French law , the French state is responsible for any damage caused to persons or goods as a result of the use of force or violence during demonstrations or similar protests .
Believe me , Commissioner , we could also approve of projects on paper but this is not a fact .
I have to tell you that , in terms of the 1993-1996 projects , on health and family planning , job creation , forestry eco-systems , farming credits and reconversion , the fight against drugs , drinking water and drainage systems , rural roads and tracks and a small involvement by NGOs , as well as intervention by the Farming Intervention Fund and the National Farming Credit Bank , this has already been done .
However , I think that it is very difficult - not only in Morocco but in any country around the Mediterranean - to make public opinion see - only two or three months following programming - that these European Union backed projects actually have immediate effects on their way of life , in the case of people living in the mountains or on small farms .
In reply to the first question , the Commission feels that the common position is autonomous and specific to the European Union .
That is what dialogue is about .
It is indeed possible .
This is even more important given the fact that the transport sector - as you yourself said - takes up a quarter - and I think that it probably takes up slightly more than that - of total energy consumption .
NATO security and defence cannot possibly have a European identity .
Our main reason for doing so is that Europeans , who have made war on each other for centuries , can formulate and develop a joint security policy for the first time , based on responsibility and solidarity , instead of each seeking individual hegemony .
What we never say is that we need to stabilize the Baltic , we need to stabilize the Mediterranean , we need to guarantee security in Central Europe , we need to show solidarity when there are problems on the borders , and recently there have been problems in Italy and Greece , and there is anxiety - which has been expressed here - in Finland .
The diagnosis of the situation in the armaments industry made by the Commission and the rapporteur is quite right .
Thank you very much , Mr President .
I would like to draw attention to the fact that this banana panel throws doubt on the possibility of maintaining an international economic order because , if this international economic order is going to consist in a whole sector as important as bananas being virtually in the hands of just one multinational - which is what will happen if things go on like this - we will find ourselves unable to control our own consumer market .
