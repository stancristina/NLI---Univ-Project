Madam President , I would like to respond to some of the speeches ; not all of them , because there have been a great many , but I would like to respond to some of them briefly .
This can , however , only be done if the other financing options have been considered .
This does not in any way mean that there is a risk of democracy being lost in any of the countries that you mentioned , and I therefore think that we should eliminate even the possibility of a risk of that happening , even if it is very remote .
I would also like to say , in response to another speaker , that the EU budget has been adapted in order to respond to the crisis and has not been stagnant in the face of this new situation that has arisen in the last two years , and it has also responded to the social challenges that have arisen .
We cannot say whether , if the majority had been women rather than men , the situation would have been the same , but I do believe that it is obvious that there would have been differences in both the cause and the management of the crisis and , of course , also in the current recovery .
It is one thing to have declarations , but what we are interested in here are tangible commitments .
What we need are clear commitments , and I will say it once again : binding , mandatory commitments that have to be fulfilled .
On behalf of the current Presidency of the Council , I wish to congratulate you on these reports that you have presented to us this evening .
There is no doubt that they clearly set out the problems of European women , the problems that we are facing in these difficult times and the challenges that we must tackle as politicians over the next few years .
The text that has been adopted commits the 27 Member States , as well as the Commission , to developing common initiatives and instruments to tackle jointly the blot that is violence against women .
That is because what must also be sustainable is a social model that has to look after a population that is expected to age considerably over the next 20 years , and the care of this population cannot be allowed to continue to fall exclusively into the voluntary hands of women .
Other questions concerning gender equality , which will form part of this EU 2020 strategy , must also be highlighted , such as overcoming gender stereotypes in education , as well as in vocational and academic guidance .
I am convinced , and with this I will conclude , Mr President , that the debate on the crisis and economic recovery must not make us stray from strengthening our European social model .
True equality means improving the life of women , making their daily lives better , making men and women live better lives from day to day .
Nor should we , the Member States , stray from the road map .
It goes without saying that we in the Spanish Government shall continue to work on placing equality at the top of the European Union agenda .
The third question I wish to address very briefly as well is my belief that it is important to underline the fact that , in order for us to achieve the 75 % employment target by 2020 , not only for men , but for women as well , it is important to understand that this means adopting active measures to promote and encourage women to play a larger role in the public sphere , and also measures to encourage and oblige men to play a larger role in the private sphere .
Mr President , I believe that the European Council meeting on 17 June could be one of the most important in recent EU history .
I believe that this whole series of EU measures and actions in recent months will take on a structured form at this European Council meeting on 17 June .
These plans are also being aided by the financial stability measures implemented by the European Central Bank , which is part of the first essential element of this economic strategy to bring the European Union out of the crisis .
This is what is expressed in various regulations that were put forward by the Commission , including during the presidency preceding the Spanish Presidency , which are currently being negotiated in this House between the Council and Parliament .
In the strategy , the Council proposes that the European Union should implement all the tools at its disposal for the purpose of this growth strategy .
Governance is the specific focus of the work of the task force chaired by Mr Van Rompuy .
It will also discuss other issues that will be the subjects of debates in the European Council that will surely be much shorter but no less important , such as the Millennium Development Goals .
I really must say - and I am not just saying this to return his praise - that the way that the Commission has worked has been extraordinarily significant , efficient , and in very close cooperation with the Spanish Presidency .
It wants the European Union to maintain its leadership in terms of the famous 20-20-20 targets for combating climate change ; it wants no more than 10 % of pupils to leave school early in the European Union ; it wants more than 40 % higher education in the European Union ; it wants 20 million people to come out of poverty in the next few years .
However , there have never been so many initiatives from the Commission that are
