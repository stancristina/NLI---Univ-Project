Over 200 Members of this Parliament from the European People ' s Party took part in the convention in Rome , which included the meeting with the Prime Minister , Mr Berlusconi , and they can testify that Mr Berlusconi outlined the government ' s positions and his own personal position on terrorism and the Middle East crisis .
Madam President , rather than concerning himself with the internal affairs of the European People ' s Party , Mr Schultz would do well to concentrate on those of his own group , which has a minority in Parliament and lost the elections in Italy .
The left-wing democrats are in trouble .
According to the proposal , the net revenue deriving from the investments of the assets of the Coal and Steel Research Fund would constitute revenue in the EU budget .
Such a passive role is envisaged for us that it is completely contradictory to the present-day requirements of transparency and accountability , and Parliament would have even less power than it does in budgetary matters .
Indeed , the Commission ' s document refers to the Treaty establishing the European Community , without specifying any particular article , and to the Protocol annexed to the Treaty of Nice , Article 2 - under which the European Parliament has consultation powers only - a Treaty which , however , is not yet in force and which it is highly unlikely will become effective before July 2002 .
Consequently , we are in a very fluid situation which has never occurred in the past and will never occur again , since the ECSC Treaty is the only Treaty to have an expiry date , and I would stress this .
I hope that you will agree with this line of approach .
Indeed , the Commission has always maintained that this House , which directly represents the people of Europe , should play a central role in the institutional triangle , on an equal footing with the Council , representing the Member States , and the Commission , which represents the European public interest .
This is simply not true , as is clear from the White Paper itself .
This goes far beyond the power to 'call back ' responsibility for executive decisions , on which some Members of this House have focused much attention .
However , the paper also states very clearly that the terms and limits of the Commission ' s executive role must be laid down in the new legislation that you will discuss on the basis of the Commission ' s final proposal .
These associations play an important role in raising public awareness and integrating our society , and we therefore wish to enjoy a useful relationship with them .
In any case , the Treaty will remain unchanged , all the decisions will continue to be taken by the appropriate institutions in accordance with the current democratic rules .
Parliament will thus be fully involved in drawing up the rules and the necessary guarantees for adopting such an act .
That is why I have said that the debate on the options set out in the White Paper on Reform of European Governance is the first phase in the debate on the future of the Union .
We need the kind of mature reflection that is characteristic of this House .
All this in itself reveals a deep-seated problem for as long as we give that impression ( and we either give it or not ) .
In the G8 debate here in this House , I pointed out that , while globalisation is proceeding apace in all fields , it is hard for it to involve politics , which thus remains inadequate and slow compared with what is happening in other sectors .
Today ' s debate on governance is important because it aims at encouraging broader discussion on the meaning of European integration and its goals .
A second important point , which has already been hinted at , is the need to simplify Community legislative procedures , distinguishing , that is , between political and legislative decisions , which must not become detailed technical instruments ; and distinguishing between Parliament ' s prerogatives and competences that belong to the executive .
Let us not confuse this with plurality of presence .
The content was absolutely identical : in Washington we spoke with a single voice , and after the discussions we left President Bush with the European position , which was a highly operational position , with specific areas for collaboration in justice and internal affairs and the financial problem of money recycling , fields in which we proposed lines of action on which Europe should come together .
Mrs Kauffmann and others have made some extremely useful suggestions .
If we start out now in the directions outlined here , I believe it will help us later to find the institutionally most appropriate solutions .
We should use the same methodology with the agency problem .
If we really define Europe as the Europe of subsidiarity , we must be consistent to some degree at least , and on this I have no reservations at all .
I repeat : it has never been our intention to attribute an institutional or constitutional role to consultations with civil society , even though we are concerned to understand what is happening within that society , and thus to keep our eyes open and ears tuned , ever alert to whatever is happening .
Mr President , there has probably been a translation problem .
A great many refugees - a great many people who have every right to be recognised as such - wait for months or years without receiving aid , deprived of work , gradually sliding towards illegality and often sucked into areas of organised and other crime .
We therefore need to
