Meanwhile , two thousand people in the last year have needlessly , unnecessarily lost their lives because the Commission would rather talk than act .
I hope tonight and tomorrow the Commission listens to the vote of this House and decides to proceed with its commitment to have a directive on safer car fronts .
No more talk , please .
Let us see some action .
And , indeed , the same is true for blood alcohol .
We have had talk on this issue , year in , year out .
We all know that ten thousand people a year in Europe are killed in drink-related crashes .
We must tackle that particular problem .
But I find it highly ironic , and I am sure the timing is not coincidental , that on the very day that we are debating blood alcohol , drink driving , road safety , the day before this Parliament is to vote on drink driving , the Commissioner has already made her mind up .
She has issued a recommendation on drink driving .
It would have been nice , would it not , for the Commissioner to have at least listened to the debate , learned what the outcome of the vote was tomorrow , before she decided to pre-empt the parliamentary procedures and issue this recommendation .
We know a recommendation , alas , is simply not worth the paper it is written on .
Member States need and support clear guidance .
We believe it is time for the Commissioner to get tough on drunk drivers and drink driving , to come forward with a directive to reduce the limit to 50 mg .
In the United Kingdom , which has traditionally had a good record , we have sadly seen over the Christmas period a rise in the numbers of people drinking and driving .
In my own region , in some parts of my region , 17 % of drivers tested were above the UK legal limit of 80 mg .
It is quite clear that we need action .
Indeed the British government is asking for a solution at European level , in a European context .
So all I make is a very simple request to the Commissioner tonight to listen to the debate and to heed the vote tomorrow .
Mr President , my name was mentioned .
It is important for the record to clarify the situation in the UK relating to the UK Government 's view on blood alcohol .
I am sure that the DG on Transport and Energy has a copy of the UK 's road safety strategy that was published in March 2000 .
It makes it very clear that the new government in the United Kingdom is committed to a solution within a European context .
I believe you would now find a much more positive response to a proposal for a directive than perhaps was the case with the previous administration .
Mr President , I should like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Costa , for his excellent work on what is a very difficult , detailed but important dossier .
Congestion , pollution , gridlock , global warming , floods , freak weather .
Is it the end of the world ?
No, it is just rush-hour in my region .
The same problems are occurring in regions and Member States across the European Union .
We all have the same transport crisis and there may be common solutions to these common problems .
We must all accept the fact , for example , that the fastest growing source of global warming gases is the transport sector .
Something surely , colleagues , must be done .
However , as we all know , everyone wants someone else to do it .
That is our challenge .
I hope Mr Costa 's work , his report and the conclusions we will reach tomorrow will provide a framework within which we can begin to tackle these problems .
We must promote better understanding of our common problems and , indeed , find common solutions to them across the European Union , but on the basis of consensus and mutual understanding .
Secondly , we must promote an exchange of ideas .
Many localities and regions have excellent ideas , and that knowledge and information must be disseminated throughout the European Union .
Indeed , that is my third point : Europe has a key role to play here in disseminating best practice as to how best we tackle the transport challenge .
Fourthly and finally , in terms of what Europe 's contribution can be within the framework of this particular initiative , I hope that governments , local authorities and those implementing taxes and charges can do so within a framework that is developed and integrated at a European level , and do it together .
However , I want to say that there is great concern and anxiety about this particular Commission initiative and , indeed , about Mr Costa 's report , although I personally feel that many of those concerns were fully addressed in committee where , I know , there was widespread cross-party support for Mr Costa 's work .
There were concerns , for example , about subsidiarity .
But that was more than adequately addressed when we said to the Commission : you have a key role to play in trying to pull this research together .
But , clearly , Member States and their role will be fully respected in terms of their rights to determine their own taxation levels .
Indeed , the work we have done has already gained and secured widespread support .
I can refer to a letter from the organisation that represents the motoring clubs across Europe , including , for example , the AA and RAC , who are broadly sympathetic and
