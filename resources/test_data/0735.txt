Member States sign up to green laws because it looks good to do so , and opposing or moderating them is seen as politically insensitive .
If , in fact , they cannot comply with what they have agreed to , such countries are doing Green causes harm .
If the Germans and others , for example , now have trouble with the habitats directive , why did we not hear more about it when that directive was going through this Parliament ?
And did the German Government , in fact , vote against that directive originally ?
Certainly the cost of clean-up laws must be taken into account when a law is adopted .
A good example of the failure to do this is the urban waste water directive which the government of Brussels cannot afford to comply with .
We suspect that the same thing will happen with the national emissions ceiling directive .
Thirdly , we want Member States to develop the infrastructures which will allow them , all of them , to carry out the monitoring work that must accompany the proper implementation of many of the EU directives we adopt here .
My colleagues and I were desperately disappointed that the Council felt it could not agree to our proposal to transform the environmental inspections recommendation into a directive .
We were not demanding an EU inspectorate but simply that Member States should agree to bring their national inspectorates up to a common high standard .
We will continue to pursue this idea in two years time when the issue should return to us .
Fourthly , we want much quicker action by the Commission to take Member States to court when they break EU law .
Last week the Greek Government , which can ill afford to do so , paid the second instalment of a fine , now totalling over EUR 2 million for failure to comply with a judgment of the Court of Justice over the dumping of waste in Crete .
This was thirteen years after the Commission received the first complaint about the dumping of that waste and no less than nineteen years after the directive concerned came into force .
It is absurd that a poor country should get itself into a situation of paying back money to Brussels , but equally absurd that the case should have taken so long .
Finally , let me say that we in Parliament are not daunted or diverted by the idea that the European Parliament should only be concerned with the adoption of legislation and not with its follow-up .
Apparently the Environment Council was somewhat surprised and even disapproving that we had intruded into their territory and that our intention was to take the environmental inspections recommendation very seriously .
MEPs , as we will all know , are on the receiving end of public criticism of poor implementation .
The public tends to complain to us , not to the Environment Council .
In the interests of the people of Europe and their environment , we will pursue this issue and we will not let go .
Mr President , my assistant , Vikki Phillips , has just handed me a note which says that Denmark spends 15 times more than Greece in carrying out environmental inspections and making appropriate assessments .
Well , if that is the case , then something is clearly very wrong , and I suspect it is not wrong with Denmark .
I am very pleased to support most of what the Chairman of the Committee on the Environment has said , although I have some trepidation in doing so being conscious that the next ECJ fine may well be against the UK for its failure to comply with the bathing water directive , despite the fact that a great deal of money has been spent and effort made in recent years to reach such compliance .
I want to make it clear , though , that I do not believe that we should be using the failure of some Member States to achieve compliance with environmental legislation to justify weakening our ambitions or claiming that too much legislation is impractical .
I am all for being realistic and for making sure that new legislation makes sense but the problems we face both throughout the European Union and across the world are too great for us to lower our sights .
And I think some of the progress made by the United Kingdom in implementing the habitats directive over the past year demonstrates very clearly that it is very often not the fault of the legislation but the lack of political will which is to blame for the failure to deliver the goods we all wish to see .
I want strongly to support the idea of a scoreboard which the Commissioner mentioned and of gestures to name and shame those Member States which are failing to meet the expectations of MEPs , of the Commission and of the public .
As a politician , the Commissioner knows very well the importance of making sure that that information is presented in a way which is easily digestible and understood by every journalist across the European Union and perhaps a few politicians as well .
So , let us call it the Commission 's little red book , no , let us call it the Commission 's big green book , albeit one with a few black spots on its pages .
Let us name and shame at every opportunity and bring the public alongside us in ensuring that this environmental legislation is enforced and that Member States recognise their responsibilities .
Mr President , first of all I must thank the Commissioner and the Chairman and other colleagues for their words of wisdom .
They are very positive and clear commitments to do something about this very serious problem
