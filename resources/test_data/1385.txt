is unethical .
Are our arguments later to be abandoned on the basis of the fact that we actually already clone anyway , technically speaking ?
However , I do not think that there are any grounds for making a distinction from the point of view of technical methods or the foetus .
Mr President , Guti√©rrez-Cortines ' report states that the Union administration ' s besetting sin - its slow start to getting measures off the ground - afflicted the theme year of lifelong learning .
That naturally made it hard to implement the theme year programme .
Unfortunately , the situation appears to be the same with the Socrates programme 2 that has just started .
This cannot help but be reflected also in the implementation of the adult education component , Grundvik , which forms part of Socrates .
Training and education are being seen more and more clearly as European resources .
But the Year of European Languages , organised for next year , will have to persevere in the same way , appropriations being as meagre as they were with the Year of Lifelong Learning .
European success in global competition is built on skilled and involved people .
Lifelong learning is essential in the fight against unemployment and exclusion .
Lifelong learning , as such , is often seen only as a necessary regeneration of the workforce .
That opportunity must be taken .
We must ask ourselves whether it is necessary to get caught up in a crisis before we start to speak about better strategies .
The reason for this is the difficulty of replacing tax revenue in the short term , and the long-term consumption-curbing effect of taxes whereby we aim to have an impact on the future state of our environment .
However , something has to be done .
In the longer term , fuel prices will bump up inflation still further and threaten the whole EU area with an economic setback .
The responsibility for action clearly lies with national governments .
It will be difficult to get a quick result , however .
It is claimed that the refinery chain is in the hands of so few that a cartel-like situation has developed in the market .
I myself am not claiming that this is the case , but we need to look into the situation .
The Commissioner has already mentioned the dilapidated state of production machinery in Russia , a large oil producer .
With a glint in his eye , he said that the Stone Age did not end because people ran out of stones .
A lot has been said about switching to a sustainable energy policy , but precious little has been done about it .
I welcome the ideas that have been put forward here today by the Commissioner .
Road transport has increased from a 50 % share of all transport in 1980 to an 85 % share in 2000 .
We should not be making these kinds of mistakes now .
We want to start implementing this also with regard to the budget , and we are proposing a new budget policy called " New Energy Sources " .
We require the issue of energy to be included in the Treaty and have its own chapter there , and we want to stress how important it is to rid ourselves of the requirement of unanimity with regard to taxation .
For almost ten years , we have been trying to establish a common energy tax in the European Union .
In the short term we have to help the direct victims of this oil crisis , but it has to be done with the proper care and focus .
In matters of data protection we have to make the difficult compromise between the protection of privacy , the safety of our citizens , and the stability of the Single Market .
The rapid exchange of information between official bodies is the only chance we have of preventing criminal exploitation of the benefits of this free movement .
The rapid growth in ecommerce in particular is posing new threats to the protection of data concerning our citizens .
For example , the theft of credit card information and the abuse of personal ID are growing dramatically in the information networks .
It is reasonable to suppose that the work of the various data protection bodies working now in the EU area can be made more effective through centralisation .
The workload is increasing at a ferocious rate .
Supervision always leads to difficult interpretations of a situation , the outcome of which many players may well wish to influence , owing to purely financial interests .
Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mrs Ferrer on having produced a balanced report .
We demand coherence and coordination .
When we speak of development cooperation , in the same breath it is a salutary exercise to remind ourselves that development cooperation is not an objective in itself .
At EU level , this means , for example , that our policy should not encourage countries to survive on the basis of just one product .
At EU level , we must also see to it that our values are reflected in our policy on development cooperation .
Conditionality must have its place .
In other cases we have to confine ourselves just to humanitarian aid .
In fact the risk is considerable .
Crises caused by environmental problems must be able to be predicted , and aid should not be given in such a way that it stirs up conflict over natural resources .
Through the conditionality of aid we can prevent corruption and the oppression of certain groups .
I know that the issue is not simple and that conditionality is an arduous and cumbersome exercise , but positive conditionality , as it is referred to , can achieve a lot .
