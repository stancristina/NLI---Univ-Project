I feel that the transparency and clarity of these markets , which will result from the process of simplification set out in this report , are reason enough to justify minimal levels of Community regulation in this sector .
Regional development can be taken into account , and social and environmental objectives (especially working conditions , protecting jobs , or even the means of production themselves ) can be promoted , by inserting special provisions into the contract .
While it is true that these directives are very important for the equilibrium of the internal market and crossborder awards , the greatest benefit of these directives does not reside in this fact , but in the opportunity they provide for promoting sustainable development .
This directive follows the Lisbon Strategy guidelines closely .
For these reasons we voted against this proposal as well .
The possibility for Member States to take appropriate measures to prevent adventitious contamination of conventional or organic crops by GMOs is also accorded prominence , though it is difficult to conceive of effective control mechanisms once GMOs have been released into the environment , since borders have been removed and goods can move freely .
Measures supporting and encouraging such research should never cease .
I would , however , emphasise the need to respect life in all its different forms , as well as the strict codes of conduct that govern the handling and use of substances as delicate and complex as these .
In his speech , he accused the EU of contributing to hunger in Africa by blocking imports of GMOs , and demanded that Community restrictions on GMOs be lifted .
Due to the absence of tough and integrated legislation on genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) , legislation capable of safeguarding consumers and the industry alike , EU procedures for awarding marketing authorisations have been suspended for the last three years .
I repeat that the effectiveness of any environmental policy depends on the will and commitment of national institutions : these are responsible for planning and mobilising resources , for holding industry directly responsible for reducing packaging waste .
In this way , they can factor those environmental costs into the final price of the product .
In particular , I dispute the proposal that the recycling and recovery deadlines set for Portugal , Greece and Ireland be brought forward from 2012 to 2009 .
The Union 's strategic objectives as set out in Lisbon , and especially the environmental dimension , reinforced and transformed into sustainable development in Gothenburg , require the adoption of measures and policies capable of combating environmental waste and damage .
We feel that it is a priority and a matter of urgency to pursue the battle against the destruction of the ozone layer , the greenhouse effect and the ensuing global warming .
By accepting the gas emission allowance trading perceived by some as a tool for achieving the targets of the Kyoto Protocol , this report shares that point of view .
The directive will create an EU greenhouse gas emissions market , introducing emission allowances for industrial installations .
The Development Agenda must not be a paper tiger .
The United States has stood in the way of an agreement , and is even pressuring some countries to give up the right to import generic medicines .
My second point is to remind you that the recent reform of the common agricultural policy ( CAP ) fully permits us to assume a more assertive stance in the negotiations .
If it is not , globalisation will be rejected by our societies .
For the same reason , I feel bound to distance myself once more from some of the amendments adopted for a second time by the Committee on Transport , since they are totally at odds with the consensus reached in the Council , and also with the Commission 's newly reconsidered position , which , of course , I commend .
Mr President , Commissioner , we are evaluating today , at second reading , a package of measures designed to create a Single European Sky .
I give my full support on this point to the Council 's common position , according to which the delineation of the functional blocks falls within the exclusive competence of the Member States and cannot be changed by the European Union .
I would argue , therefore , that each Member State should be completely free to designate the service provider for its own airspace , under the supervision of national regulatory authorities and without being answerable to any other organisations whatsoever .
We realise that there are 'extraordinary circumstances ' under which one may be led to conclude that air carriers are not always responsible for delayed or cancelled flights .
Indisputably , however , there is no sign of a European economic recovery in the immediate future .
To return to the Bank , there are also good reasons for believing that mistakes were made in setting the point of departure for monetary policy levels ( an inflation rate of 2 % ) and that these are not in line with the potential growth of the European economy .
What contribution can the ECB make to overcome the lack of structural reforms necessary in order to attain the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy ?
The introduction of the single currency was a huge success , but although the new notes and coins have brought with them widespread satisfaction , the same cannot be said of the processing of payments in the euro zone .
It was not until a year ago that electronic banking cards could be used all over the euro zone as well as in the countries in which they were actually issued .
To conclude , I will state my conviction that the euro zone must be made to work effectively by reducing banking commissions to the rates charged
