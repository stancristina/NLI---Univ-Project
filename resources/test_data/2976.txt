architecture and the development of a common foreign and security policy ?
Do we actually have the necessary instruments , if we are being told that Euratom is not enough ?
Are military matters going to take precedence over our responsibility to our common environment and the threats to the health of our citizens ?
I would be very interested in the Commission 's perspective on that particular point .
Mr President , I too would like to extend my deepest sympathy to our Spanish colleagues in the face of the latest terrorist murder by ETA.
I agree that more resolute action is required against terrorism .
It is worth bearing in mind that those responsible for the 28 murders in Omagh have still not been brought to justice .
Turning to the problem of HMS Tireless , it seems to me that this is indicative of a more widespread difficulty in the equipment of the British armed forces as a direct result of policies pursued by the Labour government .
On the one hand we have a government with no connections to the armed forces and with a card-carrying member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament as Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office , using the armed forces as a political tool to further its ambitions in Europe and apparently realising rather too late that the European Union defence scheme would indeed damage the NATO alliance and transatlantic relations .
On the other , the Labour government is not prepared to ensure that the armed forces are provided with the resources to carry out the increasing burden of commitments being placed upon them .
It is scandalous that , at this moment , 11 out of the 12 hunter-killer submarines in service in the Royal Navy are non-operational , with four in refit and 7 showing signs of the defect which afflicts HMS Tireless .
The recall of the submarine fleet has robbed the Royal Navy of a quarter of its fighting vessels and left the Trident and carrier forces with much reduced protection .
It is a fact that at one stage the only submarine operating in British waters was a German U-boat .
Last year , much of the Royal Navy was forced to stay in port because it had overspent its clearly inadequate fuel budget .
Meanwhile , at a time when flexibility and rapid response are military watchwords , the Navy 's frontline strength is being slashed .
The submarine fleet is being cut by almost 20 % , the frigate and destroyer fleet , already too small , is being cut from 35 to 32 % .
I point all this out because the maintenance and repair problem of Tireless is a reflection of a wider malaise affecting the Royal Navy through cutbacks which have gone too far .
And , as we have already heard , it has provided those that do not really have the wider , democratically expressed interest of the people of Gibraltar at heart with an opportunity to make mischief .
Mr President , my colleagues and I extend our deepest condolences to the family of the victim of the senseless ETA terrorism in Spain .
As one of the six MEPs nominated to represent Gibraltar until direct elections are held in four years time , it has been partly my responsibility to liaise with the Gibraltar authorities and the London Ministry of Defence to establish the truth of the situation regarding the repairs to the nuclear submarine HMS Tireless .
The facts are that a single crack in the cooling system was discovered with a leak of water , described in the Spanish press rather inappropriately as radioactive .
Although this is technically correct , the level of radiation is so low that it is actually fit to drink .
The reactor has been fully shut down as preparations are made to cut out a circular section of the main pipe and to return this to the UK for thorough examination before coming to a final decision as to how best to weld or remove it in the defective pintle area of the ship .
There is absolutely no immediate danger or emergency of any kind , or any threat posed to the surrounding population of Spain .
The interests of the people of Gibraltar and southern Spain are identical in this regard .
Chief Minister Peter Caruana has wisely asked a panel of experts to report directly to him .
The panel has recommended allowing the next stage to proceed , while stipulating that the Ministry of Defence must fully understand the cause of the defect before commencing the essential repairs .
Repairing a submarine in situ remains by far the safest option available : towing it would not only be dangerous but would , in any event , require considerable repairs to be done beforehand .
The Spanish Government has until now shown considerable maturity in its response to this situation .
I would point out with regard to references in the motions for resolutions to the role of the Commission that it is not the view of the UK Government that the Euratom Treaties are applicable in military situations of this kind .
Nevertheless , the British authorities have endeavoured to be as open as possible with their Spanish counterparts .
Lack of spending on new military hardware because of defence cuts by the British Labour government will no doubt in future result in more frequent episodes of defective military equipment being taken out of service for essential repairs .
That said , I hope that this debate will not degenerate into an attempt to attack either Mr Aznar or the Royal Navy , whose resolve this century against threats of tyranny from the right and the left is an important reason why all of us in this Chamber are able to enjoy the freedoms that we share .
