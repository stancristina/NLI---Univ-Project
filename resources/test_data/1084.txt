which the European Union is based must guide the management of globalisation , so that it may be sustainable .
In summary , we cannot manage this policy in the erratic way that we are doing at the moment .
We therefore hope that this report bears fruit .
This report must include the provisions which are adopted by the management committee of the fisheries sector in implementation of the provisions of that regulation .
The European Parliament wishes to participate , together with the FAO , in the definition of new notions , which are more precise and more developed , of undeclared and unregulated illegal fishing , of declarations of catches , of inspections at sea and in ports , of prohibitions of landings etc . for this irresponsible form of fishing .
Commissioner , if you attended a meeting , either a preparatory working meeting or an annual meeting of one of these RFOs , and saw the resources deployed by other delegations and the resources available to the Community delegation , you would immediately give the order to create such a unit .
Mr President , as we all know , species of highly migratory fish share a series of characteristics which require their fishing to be subject to a particular kind of monitoring .
We know that there is already an internal Council agreement to try to lessen the impact of the ban on driftnets on certain Member States , but this has already been suitably compensated for within the Council by means of quota assignments .
In the practical field , we pay the price for this when it comes to decision making or reaching agreements , as happened in relation to the lack of scale on swordfish at the last ICCAT meeting .
The Community and the RFOs must not hesitate to confront them , because the first to be affected by this type of fishing are the resources and the Community fleet , which complies with the rules of the common fisheries policy .
Mr President , we can only express our satisfaction at the conclusion of a new fishing protocol with a third country , with which we already enjoy a long history of working together .
While we are on the subject of agreements , I would like to end by mentioning the Commission ' s working programme for this year , whose timetable for the renewal of protocols is incomprehensible .
This is a modest agreement , both in terms of fishing opportunities and in terms of financial compensation - since 1994 it has been restricted to tuna-fishing ships - but it is no less important for that .
As well as a whole orchestra reading the same score , a conductor is required , and the Commission must show that it has the will to act as the conductor .
I believe that - as Mr Patten has just explained - the Commission and the European Union as a whole can have a very clear conscience in the sense that we are the major donor of humanitarian aid to Iraq , but I believe that we should carry out a serious analysis and ponder the results of the 'oil for food ' programme , given that many Arab countries believe that the Iraqi authorities are committing fraud to the tune of more than USD 1 000 million per year .
Now , Colin Powell says that the US administration is considering a system of sanctions which will hit the Iraqi regime rather than the Iraqi people .
In conclusion , I should like to say that it is not only in the Arab countries that the West is considered to be responsible for the prolonged suffering of Iraqi children .
This process began in 1995 and was made concrete in the Declaration from the First Summit between the Heads of State and Government of Latin America and the Caribbean and the European Union , held in RÃ­o de Janeiro from 25 to 29 June 1999 .
Bearing in mind , too , that the European Parliament represents the will of European society , which is not only a commercial and economic society but also a society full of concern for justice , fairness , solidarity , culture and the social dimension , Parliament hopes to use this report to introduce new directives expressly embodying the following requirements .
In order to achieve this , Parliament must be able to approve this report , which has been adopted unanimously by the Committee on Foreign Affairs following considerable help from the Commission ' s Secretariat General .
Parliament nevertheless feels that the division of the negotiating process into two separate phases is discriminatory and should be corrected .
During the discussion of the report - in the drafting of which , Mr Patten , we enjoyed an excellent working relationship with the services of the Directorate-General for Latin America and those of the Mercosur and Chile division - we heard that one of your colleagues , Mr Lamy , who is responsible for trade relations , did not support the idea of revising the negotiating directives unless the Council accepted the idea first .
The comments that I have just made about trade apply just as much to cooperation , because even if we acknowledge the size of the contribution we have made to the region , which in absolute terms adds up to a sizeable amount , we feel that there is , to some extent , a degree of unjustified discrimination against the subcontinent compared with the treatment of other parts of the world .
The subsequent phrase appeared in the draft statement but was deleted in the rush to prepare the final version , which I had to complete in just 24 hours .
This agreement is therefore extremely important .
I therefore only wish to highlight two points
