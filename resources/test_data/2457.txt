The first , and most important , proposal is , in my opinion , that all legislative proposals should be subject to a so-called citizens ' criterion .
Nobody , not even the Commission , quite knows exactly who is involved in these .
Finally , turning to the consultation of organisations , I have quite specifically underlined the need for local and regional authorities to be among the bodies consulted .
European governance thus becomes more efficient and moves closer to the citizen .
When the Commission took office , it announced once again that it would apply itself fully to tackling fraud and irregularities in the EU Institutions , justifiably so , for there are billions of euros involved .
This idea already met with resistance then from the Directorate-General dealing with tax cases and from a number of Member States .
There was wide indignation in the Netherlands about the simple termination of an experiment that had been found to be effective for hairdressers , cobblers , decorators and bicycle repairers – and this in times of recession , no less .
After all , it is quite clear that there is wide support here in the European Parliament to include the experiment of Annex K in a structural insertion of these labour-intensive services in Annex H of the Directive .
I promised the electorate then that financial control in the new European Commission would be considerably enhanced .
That worked in our opinion .
Is the Commission thinking about starting with this ?
Opposition to this was led by Mr Schulz and Mr Nassauer .
This question will be at the heart of my report on the discharge for the European Parliament for the 2002 financial year . 2004 is an election year ; we cannot afford to embark upon this election with the current system , which is morally corrupt .
This discrimination has therefore now been lifted .
If we want to promote the free movement of persons and wish to achieve further integration of the internal market , a solution will need to be found for the not-so-pleasant things in life too – like calling on health care abroad .
You will soon be able to receive the care with a card .
It is , of course , marvellous that we will have this permit next year , but I think that these things are sometimes done all too hastily .
This has had a beneficial impact on employment .
I call for enforcing the Member States ' right to keep the rates of VAT on labour-intensive services low if this is underpinned by sound arguments from a social and employment point of view .     . – Public opinion sees the EU as , above all , a large-scale organisation far removed from the citizen , and as one offering tremendous scope for fraud .
This will then also give the various groups the opportunity of concluding compromises .
The compromise on unpaid donations causes us a dilemma .
I should like to remind you that the lack of arrangements for employees ' information and consultation was one of the main reasons for rejecting the previous proposal for a directive on takeover bids in 2001 .
My Group wishes to stress that this should be a normal part of the procedure .
Our original position was to make a directive without Articles 9 and 11 protecting minority shareholders ' rights .
But we only want to support it if these three amendments are adopted .
Although we have known this for a while , it has just dawned on me that Mr Bolkestein is rejecting the defensive mechanisms that are now being proposed in the amendments and that are more or less optional in each country , resulting in the creation , as he intended , of a very watered-down version of the directive .
The majority of the group are behind me on this .
Countries such as the Netherlands and Germany were right to be completely opposed to this .
Prices may well increase for the users in many cases .
And in the final analysis , this is very much to be welcomed .
We should therefore have the nerve to take decisions that transcend our national interests , and transcend certain political items which we would like to realise .
We need this big stick .
I will pull out all the stops for this , and we have all day tomorrow as well .     – Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the report on environmental liability has led to extremely complex and , indeed , emotionally-charged debates in the competent committees .
This is also evident from the battle between the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market .
Another important point is compulsory insurance .
He has taken only right-wing views into consideration , as illustrated by the amendments relating to good agricultural practice .
The Manders report , as we have voted on it in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market , provides for those pre-conditions , so I must congratulate the rapporteur and our group ’s shadow rapporteur on the work and on the team effort .
The correction of defects and injuries of the human body by means of tissues and cells , on the other hand , remains a sensitive issue .
In fact , the term 'directive ' is not even justified ; 'empty shell ' would be a more accurate label .
Despite conflicts of interest , entrepreneurs and workers agreed that their companies would provide jobs for future generations .
These two goals are not very compatible .
I am not certain whether everyone knows this , but that is the lowest percentage since 1990 , and as far as that is concerned , we
