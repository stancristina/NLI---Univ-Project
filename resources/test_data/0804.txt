set aside EUR 150 million for a period of five years .
This shows that , when problems arise , when a clear decision has to be made - 'yes ' or 'no ' - it would seem that the peoples of the countries realise that they are in a situation where they are deciding the course of history and are extremely aware of the importance of European Union affairs .
Mr President , the pensioners which I have the pleasure of representing in the European Parliament tell me that they are very pleased that I have voted - as I did - for this text , for I feel it is important and am waiting impatiently for Europe to have either a Constitution or a founding Charter with the status of a Constitution to which they can all appeal in order to call for justice whenever they are the victims of an injustice .
Evidence of this is , not least , the language people use and the way they find it difficult to use the words ' Islamic ' or ' Islamic fundamentalist ' in conjunction with the word 'terrorism ' . It would seem that Europe wants to play down the contribution to terrorism of certain Arab and Islamic countries such as Iraq , Syria , Libya , the Sudan , Iran and others .
The Antimafia Commission has condemned the collusion between the Mafia and terrorism on a number of occasions : in my country , the Mafia organisation , the Camorra , regularly supplies terrorists with false documents .
If today , the entire world has taken up the fight against terrorism , it has done so because terrorism violates precisely that which the entire world - all the States and all the citizens - has subscribed to in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .
Nothing more , nothing less , so let us not beat about the bush .
Madam President , after what in particular Mr Coelho- our Chairman and committee coordinator last year - has just said , there is little to add .
It is also essential to insist that legislation respecting the Charter of Fundamental Rights - both that devised by the Convention and that we adopted before Nice - be introduced in all the countries of the Union .
This should be a condition for membership of the Union .
We are continuing to focus , as Mr Vattimo did in his last speech , on the Anglo-American system of systematic , blanket interception of communications filtered by search engines , but we are continuing to ignore the fact - and we are all responsible for we all know what is going on - that these systems are also being used in European countries such as Germany , Holland and France .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , at this difficult time for the civil aviation sector , whose future we debated recently in this Chamber when we discussed the single European sky rules , the European Commission has proposed a new regulation on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding .
We must not , however , lose sight of the overall context of this proposal .
The first is the definitions .
Neither the criteria established for the definition of the new compensation amounts nor the impact assessment satisfy the members of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism .
I would just like to say , by way of conclusion , a quick word about the amendments tabled .
There are two things I would like to say to the European Commission .
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Goebbels , the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has done an excellent job on this directive .
Moreover , we would be running the risk of it having little or no effect because , if a person wants to put the information in their possession to an inappropriate use , they will find a way to do so whatever we do , whatever the law governing the matter .
I therefore hope that , if the European Parliament adopts my amendment , a further boost will be given to this project whose implementation is awaited by a significant part of Europe , and , if possible , to other projects , which will then be practically implemented .
The Council therefore needs to make every effort to hold a frank dialogue with the US Administration and to present to us a report stating a clear position on the compatibility of any potential bilateral agreements with the Rome Statute , before the Copenhagen European Council takes place .
Although it is true that we must welcome signs of cooperation from the Iranian Government , we also need to realise that the increase in executions and the continued stonings are a negative sign for the Union , which cannot accept them out of respect for its own Charter of Fundamental Rights and the international conventions .
Ladies and gentlemen , you are now all aware of the results of the Brussels European Council .
I also want to stress the solidarity the Brussels Council showed towards the candidate countries , which still need financial help to approach the level of development of the rest of the continent .
Last week we presented the conclusions of the Brussels Council to the representatives of the candidate countries .
Let me stress that we are not putting a package to the candidates and telling them to take it or leave it : acceptable compromises are clearly possible .
The reality of enlargement is taking form .
More generally , a thorough look at all our policies is needed to take account of the quantitative and , even more so , the qualitative aspects of the new environment we will be working in after enlargement .
