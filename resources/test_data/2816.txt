I am particularly thinking of Mr Louis Michel , Foreign Affairs Minister , and Mr Elio di Rupo , the chairman of the Walloon Parti Socialiste .
( NL ) Public tenders have for a long time been considered a panacea .
On the one hand , they are an alternative to nepotism , the awarding of public contracts to entrepreneurs who are friendly with politicians or high officials .
I do , however , share the rapporteur 's view that the schoolbooks market does not function across borders and is not open to free competition , so that it is thus preferable not to lay down rules that assume that this is the case .
Legislative measures can be taken with this in mind , but such measures do not belong in the list of allocation criteria for public contracts .
Meanwhile , governments wishing to reduce taxes and suffering from a lack of funds have sold such companies to internationally operating concerns that wish to make a profit from them .
After all , since traceability and labelling are not enough to be able to guarantee the freedom of choice on the part of the consumer in the long term , co-existence measures are equally important .
I also assume that progress in these dossiers is required so that the actual moratorium on admitting new GMO applications can be lifted .
Detectability should then also replace the paper criterion .
They are physically intimidated , and some are also affected in their private lives , because attacks have been made on their properties , and even on their lives and that of their relatives .
We extend a very warm welcome to you in our midst in this Parliament , Mr Frattini .
The Chechens are not wrong by definition , and nor are the Russians .
Commissioner , the fight in Chechnya is not a fight against terrorism only .
Neither is it a process that involves the rebels , the resistance fighters , or even Mr Mashadov , the most recently elected President .
We have a delegation meeting of the Russian delegation in Moscow next Monday and Tuesday and as the chairman of this delegation , I can assure the relatives that we will bring up their son 's case for discussion during our delegation meeting in the Duma next Tuesday .
Many target dates for dealing with specific topics have not been met and are thus , unfortunately , on the agenda in Cancun , which is , in consequence , already threatening to become overloaded .
Needless to say , we totally agree that education , public health and the audiovisual sector are sectors that have to be treated separately , and we would like to keep it that way .
Will the negotiations prove that the trade system serves our citizens ' desire for ecological and social progress rather than subjecting it to the same ?
In the agricultural modalities , this means safeguarding the right of WTO members to determine food standards and to promote public goods , such as rural development , environmental protection and animal welfare .
We would like to hear a concrete reaction from you on that score .
It is , after all , a development round .
This means that the European Union has adopted an open stance and has , in this respect , most definitely contributed to a new world trade agreement .
The Americans are strong in military terms , which is why they can manage without this concern for the international legal order and can rely on power politics .
This is a very fine definition of national interest .
Despite this , I think that , especially given this understanding , a dialogue with the US must be a priority .
There may be room for some humour in this .
Firstly , we should like to see a clear commitment - laid down by law - so that the Commission can find a solution regarding the certification and training of air-traffic controllers .
Without the commitment to do this , a single airspace would be a hollow shell , with no hope of success .
That is exactly what the rearrangement of European airspace is to bring about .
They still differ on one small point , and my group has therefore requested a separate vote for Amendment No 14 .
The so-called ecopoints constitute a complex dossier in which many conflicting interests are at stake .
This is expressly a transitional stage on the way towards a sustainable approach for the whole of the Alpine region .
This sensitive dossier calls for a firm stance on the part of the European Parliament .
In my opinion - and I hail from the Netherlands , one of the countries from which transit traffic originates - this will undoubtedly result in people looking for secret routes through the Alpine region , which may then be exempted .
Mr President , Commissioner , rapporteur , ladies and gentlemen , better passenger protection is an issue particularly close to my heart .
This is very strange given that the administrative burden will be enormous .
That is my main objection at the moment .
Compensation does not apply in the case of force majeure .
I shall try to be as concise as during the procedure .
I do not wish to take on board the extra amendments now on the table , therefore , because they put under pressure the compromise adopted with an overwhelming majority by the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism .
I think that it is particularly important that we do not come to a standstill , but that we also emphasise and improve that safety aspect .
That danger is further increased if cars also have decorative fittings at the front or rear .
It brings to a conclusion many years ' debate regarding the necessity and
