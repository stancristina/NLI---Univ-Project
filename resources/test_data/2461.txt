Moreover , the concept of 'author ' is not defined in the Treaties .
The Commission is able to adopt some of them .
On behalf of the Commission , I would like to guarantee that the programming for the funds will take place in accordance with the priorities of the accession partnerships as early as in the course of the next few weeks .
There has already been talk of the 'window of opportunity ' , which has presented itself following Helsinki and on account of the d√©tente between Greece and Turkey .
It is interesting to observe how all those who are party to this process deem the European Union ' s role to be of central importance .
In comparison with the other applicant countries , Cyprus , like Malta , is a relatively rich country overall , but it must still be treated equally in some respects .
I hope that the Council as a whole will be of the same mind and that you will be able to give us the right answers to these questions .
And we all hope that it will be a united Cyprus that joins .
Rather , the way in which these aid measures have been cobbled together smacks of amateurism to me .
I will turn firstly to matters pertaining to headings 4 and 7.
Mrs Rothe , I would put it this way : I am convinced that there has been a distinct improvement in the framework conditions for reaching agreements of this kind .
The financial regulation is the legal framework we need to tackle the priorities established under the terms of the accession partnerships with Malta and Cyprus .
Mr President , I believe Mr Alavanos is getting NATO and Mr Milosevic mixed up .
Both parties were once part of the government .
The history of the Joint Assembly provides impressive evidence of a positive trend in that direction .
Let me make a few comments on aspects on which views may differ somewhat , although , even in this regard , I want to strongly emphasise and acknowledge Commissioner Patten' s activities and interest in relation to FYROM and the region as a whole .
This country is afraid it will be in a sense sidelined .
What we are doing here is not hypocritical .
So I must say quite plainly that anyone who tries to tie the agreement with Macedonia to resolving the issue of the country ' s name , as he does , will not only find Macedonia itself against him but all the other EU Member States too .
It makes them think of secret societies and conspiracies , which is the way things used to be .
I just have one more request .
That is vitally important to the accurate and reliable calculation of deficits .
Mr President , I need not repeat what the rapporteur said or the points Mr Coelho made .
We concluded that it is not , but given the importance of the issue we nonetheless agreed to accept this procedure .
In the same context , we could establish an early warning system functioning round the clock , together with a common information system for the rapid exchange of data between the responsible authorities .
As has also been pointed out , in summer 1998 the Commission submitted a communication listing a very wide variety of areas where measures need to be taken , such as information , further training - an important area , cooperation between the euro-states and of course even beyond them , and measures under criminal law .
I believe that this debate shortly before midnight will also teach a salutary lesson to all those counterfeiters who believe their hour has come , because they think the EU is no longer awake at this late hour !
At the end of 1999 there were almost 15 000 investment funds registered as UCITS with a total value of in excess of EUR 2 billion , thereby accounting for roughly 75 % of all funds assets .
The new regulation will afford the following benefits : harmonisation of competition conditions and uniform and effective protection for investors - I particularly welcome the introduction of simplified prospectuses in this respect , for they will make it easier for people to compare and assess funds ; alternative methods of saving are being created for the general public - this is particularly important in terms of making additional provision for old age - and there are new opportunities for enterprises to acquire capital .
The first is that it became apparent from the telephone bugging example and the debate surrounding this complex of issues , that possibilities for intervention in fundamental civil liberties , which are emerging in the European Union - for example , when we talk in terms of one country undertaking telephone bugging in another country - and the associated issue of the guarantees of fundamental rights that those who are affected need , are not sufficiently regulated within the European Union .
That is a dramatic development .
This is unquestionably the case .
We are still talking declarations of intent , which must be followed up with deeds .
I accept that NATO and the individual Member States were in favour of getting involved in an operation of this kind , and that they believed that this was the only option remaining to them to put an end to the ever-increasing violations of human rights and crimes perpetrated by the Milosevic regime in Kosovo , and secure a dignified existence for the Albanian people .
And I would like , very briefly , to make some specific and practical proposals that will enable us to arrive at this solution .
I really have to wonder why we adopted this motion last September .
But not a soul is helping this woman to get out of
