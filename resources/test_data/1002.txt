European action plan to combat drugs , which underpins the strategy approved by the Helsinki European Council .
It will also , and above all , be an instrument for increasing transparency and increasing the accountability of all the European Union ' s institutions towards the public .
It is my intention that this scoreboard should become an instrument providing political and strategic guidance to all the institutions , and that it should also be an instrument for public scrutiny .
Furthermore , on the subject of crossing the external borders of Member States , which is a central issue regarding the free movement of persons , I shall , in the next few days , be presenting a proposal for a regulation updating the list of third countries whose nationals are required to hold visas for crossing the external borders .
The Commission will also support the presidency ' s efforts to clarify the judicial framework and the framework for police and judicial administrative cooperation in the fight against money laundering , an eminently cross-pillar issue .
The recent restoring of certain internal border controls leads me to believe that we need a detailed analysis of the conditions for adopting a legislative instrument based on Article 62 of the Treaty .
As I have told Parliament , the task before us is immense and ambitious , and the Commission needs to have the necessary human resources to respond to this challenge .
( Sustained applause )
I would also like to remind Members that , as a candidate for membership of the European Union , Turkey will - and this is a pre-accession condition , which is an important point - sooner or later , as part of its own pre-accession strategy , have to adopt a set of policies geared towards adopting the entire acquis communautaire in good time , and including therefore all provisions already in force on nuclear safety .
We understand your concerns and will certainly take account of them , particularly during the discussions that we will be having with Turkey to define that country ' s own pre-accession strategy agenda .
Since May 1999 , that is to say , since the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam itself , this report has also contained the acts for which the Council does not act in its capacity as a legislative body , except for certain acts of limited importance , such as decisions of a procedural nature .
As you know , any such proposal will have to be tabled in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam , that is within two years of the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam , or in other words before 1 May 2001 .
We have no problem , Mr Newton Dunn , in repeating this information to you in writing , but we will not be able to go any further than what has been said here , because that meets the requirements of the Treaty exactly .
In any event , Article 255 does not , at first sight , allow work to be done on any basis that could affect the principle of subsidiarity .
The European Parliament will have the opportunity to take part in the preparatory group for the next Intergovernmental Conference .
Mr Dimitrakopoulos , transparency is naturally an issue of concern to the institutions .
We will then see , at ministerial level , how we can follow this up .
It was also stipulated that this would be revised in the light of new scientific information on preserving species , of which we hope to see examples in the first six months of this year .
That is why I think that this is quite positive from Portugal ' s point of view .
Accordingly , Mr Ortuondo Larrea , the Council reiterates its opinion that without this transfer , greater account would be taken of France ' s possibilities for anchovy fishing in the Bay of Biscay .
We genuinely share your concerns about the threatening situation which exists in Kosovo for ethnic minorities , for both the Serb and Romany populations , and the incidents of discrimination , harassment and intimidation which continue to take place in that region .
I think that this is an extremely important point : this sense of conditionality , which underlies the European Union ' s position , is being maintained by the Council and will continue to be maintained .
I have one last point to make , which is about the European Union ' s responsibility and , specifically , in this case , about possible action by the Council in this matter , and the responsibility of the international community , which has overall responsibility for the situation in Kosovo .
I think that , at the moment , particularly in the last few months , there have been some positive developments in terms of the resources that will be available to Mr Kouchner , in order for him to be able to do his job efficiently .
The issue which we should all raise , and I did so myself , in a diplomatic way , a while ago , concerns the very substance of Security Council Resolution 12/99 .
We in the Council will be trying to provide information on this matter during the Portuguese Presidency .
I would nevertheless like to say that we know that the situation in Kosovo is also closely connected with that of all the countries and regions surrounding it .
The situation in Kosovo itself will not be resolved unless there is an overall plan for stability in the region .
On the other hand , the European Regional Development Fund , the ERDF , also contributes as part of its role to promoting social and economic cohesion , by redressing the main regional imbalances and encouraging rural areas to take part in development and conversion
