Despite this , the emissions of carbon dioxide continue to increase .
If there is no adequate measuring system , the debate will be very easy to manipulate .
Monitoring is extremely important in order to check the emission of greenhouse gases .
I therefore wholeheartedly support the Commission 's proposal and the amendments by the Environment Committee .
In view of the fact that Japan is the country with the highest research and development expenditure in the world , expressed as a percentage of the gross national product , it is regrettable that there is little cooperation in this area .
At the same time I think it is clear that there is still a certain distance in cultural and political terms between Europe and Japan .
The question I would like to put to Sir Leon is whether the time has not come to look for a broader , more strategic objective in our relationship .
The rapporteur rightly corrects this approach .
The United States have chosen an aggressive unilateral approach to Japan ; that is not appropriate for the European Union .
Not only is the position of the European Union different , but the American approach has only achieved limited results .
The largest newspaper in the Netherlands ran a report about it last week .
The provisions of a communication are after all not legally enforceable and , according to the Court of Justice , may not create new obligations .
The best thing would of course be a new directive in this field , but that would probably not be feasible at the moment , just before full liberalization , nor do we wish to open Pandora 's box , but to close it .
But it should just be clarified .
Unfortunately , though , there is no legislation here .
I am therefore worried about the clarity with which the operators can work at the moment with regard to the matter of financing a universal service .
But these same self-employed entrepreneurs have to deal with gigantic changes in payment systems such as the euro and the electronic purse .
So you see that the free competition in the end again results in monopolies , which can never have been the intention .
You see vast rural areas and empty areas of town lose their quality of life through ageing and dereliction , decay and a sense of insecurity .
But the sector has now grown up .
But uniform or harmonized legislation will not remove the cause .
The interests of the environment are then pushed into the background .
There are also considerable urban and rural shifts in the retail trade .
In Flanders , the authorities have made funds available for commercial centres in the town centres .
This Committee must of course remain representative for the heterogeneous sector that it represents .
At the moment this committee is made up entirely of entrepreneurs .
Mr President , I should like to ask you whether it is correct that the Bureau has taken a decision to turn us into administrative offices instead of representatives of the people and henceforth to keep records of our mileage , train tickets , visits to the various facilities and the trips that we make .
Mr President , the new extradition convention is an improvement .
In the draft resolution it states that we regret this fact .
For the SME world , that means added value that is not to be underestimated .
In my view , certainly in the northern part of Europe , they still have an image that is too ideologically loaded .
Mr President , it is not very easy to make an appointment with my plumber .
This is very worthwhile , because Europe must do things properly with regard to employment in this sector .
We can endorse all his conclusions .
They think that this regulation does not comply with the subsidiarity principle and that their own guarantee regulations are subject to illegal competition .
Finally , I have a question for the Commissioner : is it possible for the Observatory to deal in a future annual report with the subject of the environment ?
Mr President , under Rule 22 of the Rules of Procedure , I draw your attention to the fact that you want us , as Members , to give you an exact account of what we do , at what time .
Mr President , Denktash has in fact slammed the door on the negotiations which initially seemed to have been opened with such imagination by the United Nations .
The over-supply of arms makes the dispute on the island all the more explosive .
The difference is that in December 1995 , we could have thrashed things out around the table and now , all we can do is make a protest on paper .
I think that is an important achievement .
I would therefore ask the Commission in which way it is adapting its strategy to this successful result in Bosnia-Herzegovina .
This must be made clear in the bilateral contacts between the Union and Bahrain .
Felipe de Jesur√≠n and Immelda Lopez de Sandoval were pursued by cars and threatened with death .
He was arrogant and my request fell on deaf ears .
I hope that Greece and Finland are persuaded to sign the new treaty so that the Union as well , when it acts outside , can give credible international support to this treaty .
Because what will happen then ?
It is quite probable that nothing much will happen until after 15 October 1998 , but if the currencies are being rivetted together in May , then something could happen the green ECU and I think the Commission should be ready for this contingency .
We must endeavour to achieve a system that is self-financing .
In this way , producers in
