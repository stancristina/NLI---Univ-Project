So no budgetary argument can be advanced against it .
Mr President , on behalf of the Union for Europe Group , I offer my sincerest and warmest congratulations on your election , which gives us very special pleasure .
Good luck , Mr President .
And I would remind you that every Member of this House has the same dignity and the same rights , through his electors , and the right to the same consideration as any other Member .
The voting papers used for your own election , Mr President , the election of the President of this Parliament , were not the same as those used for the election of the Vice-Presidents .
The President may exclude a Member .
What should be the strategy of this House over the remaining six months , apart from the notable efforts of our two observers and the adoption of our resolutions ?
In the business world , assets only exist if they are profitable .
If the process is not completed , European integration will be no more than it is today - a single market and a customs union , but one that tends to merge more and more into a vast free trade area , open and exposed to all the currents of globalization .
But , in this area , I believe that what makes life hard to tolerate is this civilization of enlightenment , cold , hard enlightenment that disregards the needs of human warmth , needs that are satisfied by a sense of family , by religious faith and by the greatly underrated sentiment of patriotism .
Our citizens do not understand that capitalism , to use that big word , may have been 'civilized ' in the twentieth century in a national context but that it cannot be in a European context .
But I find it shocking , and even pathetic , that developed countries could barter information technologies , whisky and brandy for the exploitation of millions of children who are being forced to work - work to death , in some cases - and whose numbers are still growing according to the ILO itself .
The United States has adopted the Fair act .
First , on the economic and financial front , the Dutch presidency is going to have to negotiate the single European market , and in this area it will certainly be much preoccupied by a great many monetary questions that dictate the future of the famous single currency .
Practical cooperation between the police , customs and justice authorities of our Member States is essential if we are to conduct an active campaign against the drug trade , but - as the President-in-Office is aware - it is equally essential to harmonize national legislation on the penalties for drug dealing and use , because in the absence of such harmonization there can be no effective action and no safety for any of our fellow citizens , and especially for the young .
So there are two inescapable conclusions .
The place where acceptance begins or the place where it ends ?
In practice the Commission would have to trust the producers .
And those uncertainties will , of course , allow too much room for manoeuvre on the part of the Commission , which , we have every reason to believe , is much more concerned with the functioning of the single market than it is with consumer safety .
I shall therefore confine myself to stating what I believe to be the essential prerequisite for any reform - the support which Europe can and must give to the consolidation of the democratic process .
I welcome the stated intentions regarding efforts to promote development and stamp out the drug trade , the defence of social justice and the environment , and the restoration of closer cultural links .
This is of course being done under the cloak of technical and safety considerations : the identification and location of fishing vessels and , in cases of distress or shipwreck , helping them as quickly as possible .
Blockage by the Commission could endanger many of them , since their future now depends on orders benefiting from FIFG aid .
Here also , courage will be needed .
By dissecting the communiqu√© , we thus discover that behind the grand declarations there was in reality no commitment , no signature to an overall commitment .
After a long process due to the disagreement between the European Parliament and the Commission and Council , which required the convening of a Conciliation Committee , the European Parliament has approved the proposal relating to novel foods and novel food ingredients .
If cultivated in open fields , will transgenic plants not release and transfer their genes to grass and weeds and give rise to resistant strains with a resultant escalation in the use of herbicides ?
On this point , we fear that the proposed free service will weaken the protection of subscribers .
I can tell you it took a lot of work behind the scenes to get this compromise .
For my country , Luxembourg , where a large portion of our territory is covered by forest eco-systems which are managed in a way which is close to nature , a certification scheme would certainly be a big advantage for selling our wood products on the market .
Our forestry strategy should lay down firm guidelines which respect the subsidiarity principle .
Thirdly , it is stressed that the multi-functional role - socio-economic , environmental and recreational - must form the basis for long-term development of forests .
Finally , in the last amendment , we call on the Commission to propose measures to guarantee economic development of forests linked to farming .
I am therefore pleased that we have been able to play a part here in these affairs
