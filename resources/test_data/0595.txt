Early marriage and other entrenched customs mean that girls often drop out of school .
Our committee calls for the effective implementation of what has already been laid down in the Barcelona Declaration regarding progress towards democracy and respect for human rights and for the gender dimension to be incorporated in the three pillars of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership .
Similarly , our committee is in favour of supporting women 's organisations in the partner countries and of networking them with women 's organisations in the Member States of the European Union .
We also paid close attention to the problems of women immigrants from these countries in the European Union and we call for the red tape and other obstacles to legal immigration into the Member States of the European Union to be lifted , because we believe that they result in poverty , marginalisation and the exploitation of human and , more specifically , women 's lives .
Mr President , I wish to offer Mrs Kratsa my warmest congratulations , both on her initiative in drafting this report and on the report itself and the clear policy proposals contained in it .
Without doubt , irrationalism and fanaticism are the main obstacles both to the emancipation of women and to social and economic progress in general in these countries .
As long as these basic aspects of a democratic state are lacking in numerous countries around the Mediterranean , there will only ever be a faint glimmer of hope of any improvement in the position of women and the resolutions passed and conferences held within the context of the Barcelona process will be meaningless .
That is why we are calling on the European Commission to use every means at its disposal , especially when negotiating association agreements , to include clear-cut clauses and commitments protecting women 's rights and the principles of the Rule of Law and recognising them as the sine qua non to social development in the countries of the Mediterranean and the promotion of the Mediterranean basin as an area of peace and cooperation .
The Barcelona process is basically a means for dialogue between the Community and the countries of the Mediterranean .
I should like to inform the House that the Commission has already taken an initiative to adopt a text of recommendations and principles in the hope that it will be accepted by the foreign ministers and will govern every contract and agreement between the European Union and third countries as regards women 's rights and the gender dimension of foreign policy .
Of course , we shall be holding separate discussions on this with the Committee on Women 's Rights , I imagine very soon , once we have the full programme and timetable , so that we can discuss a specific text with the parliamentary committee .
The objective of the ÌEDA IÉ programme is to create a free trade zone between Europe and the Mediterranean countries in the long term , by 2010 and , within it , to implement programmes which will help these countries develop economically , along with social and economic measures to support this economic development .
The Commission 's policy in this sector will be expressed in a series of initiatives and programmes which are currently in the pipeline as a result of cooperation between the Council , Parliament and the Commission .
This objective includes defining indicators to measure over a ten-year period the extent to which Member States ensure that all their citizens acquire a working knowledge of reading , writing and arithmetic .
My fourth point concerns the Community strategy on combating social exclusion .
My fifth point concerns cooperation at international level , in other words , our international strategy .
As far as the Green Paper is concerned , I must express a certain reticence , mainly because numerous new policy initiatives have been started , important matters are in the pipeline in various Councils and we are now in a position to take action on illiteracy ; it would perhaps mean additional delays if we were to proceed with the Green Paper , given that we now have most of the information we need from work carried out in previous years .
On the question of a European illiteracy monitoring centre , I have taken note of the proposal by the Members of Parliament on the need to use existing institutions , such as Cedefop , and I would remind the House that there are already a number of programmes , such as the OECD Pisa programme , which provide some initial answers .
Mr President , I too should like to congratulate Mrs Hermange on the extreme care and sensitivity with which she has drafted this report on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs .
The European Parliament also stresses in its resolution that the gender dimension needs to be included in all sectors covered by the Social Agenda and monitored in regular reports .
We need a proposal to amend the directive on the safety and health of pregnant and breastfeeding workers , i .e . directive 92/85 .
As rapporteur for the Committee on Women 's Rights for the Social Agenda , I should like to ask the Commission to tell the European Parliament how it intends to follow up these issues and if it intends to present a proposal for a directive on equal treatment in sectors other than the employment sector .
As Mrs Smet said , it is vital that we understand that this is the first social policy tool we have had at European level , a tool achieved with a great deal of hard work and sensitive negotiation .
I should like to remind the House that I presented the results of the first year 's implementation of the Agenda to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in October 2000 .
The Commission is basically
