Allow me to quote from a recent edition of the SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung , which states : " It is certainly true that without the expert knowledge and diligence of the civil servants in Brussels a century project like the euro would never materialize , because it would be talked to death for years .

The application and proposal procedures are too complicated and time-consuming and for this reason they usually fail to reach the target group .
In my view three fundamental questions have still to be answered .
Why do we sacrifice so many innocent trees to do it ?
Mr Hughes has already referred to two directives which are still pending .
At all events , I expect him to give way to the amendment which I am re-submitting to Parliament .
