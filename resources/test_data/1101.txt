the Yalta Conference and the intransigence of Truman who was determined to follow a policy of confrontation .
Fifthly , we also feel that the budgetary forecasts are not sufficient , since this is the first time that a major enlargement is taking place with a budgetary reduction and we only have to look at what happened in the case of the reunification of Germany to see that , in fact , a greater economic contribution is needed in order for this process to be successful .
However , we must not forget that , after enlargement and as a result of the low standard of living in the candidate countries , the average Community GDP is going to be reduced by at least 18 % .
They must do all of this because , after enlargement , we will not only have to combat the inequalities which those countries have inherited from the past , but also those which are being created at this very moment .
The moment to move forward will perhaps arrive after the next Intergovernmental Conference .
Nevertheless , Bulgaria now has an economy which is developing at a steady rate .
Its cooperation with the international community during the Kosovo conflict , and its balanced role at that time , are of great importance for the whole region .
Secondly , the Union should tackle enlargement with sufficient budgetary resources .
A few days ago , a French vessel , the An Oriant , based in Brittany , was shipwrecked .
I also wish it to be noted , Madam President , that the European Parliament ' s Committee on Fisheries , which it is my honour and responsibility to chair , is very sensitive to these accidents at sea .
We must remind those people who have no sense of solidarity and are concerned about the economic cost of enlargement , that the prize of peace fully justifies this cost .
Ladies and gentlemen , we are all aware of the budgetary pressures that exist within category 3 expenditure , which includes this and other programmes .
With regard to the proposal for a directive , I would like firstly to congratulate Mr Thomas Mann on the excellent work he has done .
However , as well as the penalties , the declaration of invalidity of activities is also important in the case of serious violations of the principles laid down in the directive .
That is what differentiates some benches from others .
Unfortunately today , certain sections of the media , such as television and the Internet , do not contribute through their programmes and advertisements to the dignified and respectful treatment of the sectors of society who most need that cooperation , such as , for example , women and children .
Lastly , the European Parliament must be kept informed , taking account of the reports and opinions produced by this House , and we must highlight the importance and necessity of truly making use of the opinion and participation of the NGOs and associations - and providing them with the necessary resources - since they are without doubt the key to the success of the measures adopted .
The Spanish Prime Minister - Mr Aznar - is to make an official visit to that country in October .
Mr President , I fully share the hope and the opinion of Mrs Morgantini and Mr Brie , whose first amendment clearly states that the Union ' s aim must not merely be to establish a code of conduct on arms exports , but to work for international disarmament and to end the arms race altogether .
Mr President , I should like to begin by congratulating Mr van Hulten on this very thorough report , which has deservedly received the unanimous support of the other members of the Committee on Budgetary Control .

They do not receive the same pay for equal work , with the difference reaching almost 30 % in the private sector .
If we take into account the candidate countries , the problem becomes more serious as the levels of women workers in those countries are even lower .
That is not the case , but it is a satisfactory text and , having given it great thought and following an extensive debate , the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market decided not to table any amendments .
The proposal aims to simplify customs processes by means of computerised or paperless declarations , to make the rules more flexible , to improve the procedure for collecting duties and to provide a more solid basis for applying the principle of good faith to imports that are subject to the preferential regime , establishing legal instruments that enable us to combat fraud and offering greater legal security .
The Council considered that it was not drafted suitably in order to be included in the Community Customs Code and pointed out that there is a Green Paper - which is currently being converted into rules - specifically for combating fraud .
As the rapporteur pointed out , however , neither the Council nor the Commission adopted the specific amendments that I have mentioned , because , among other reasons , they considered that they did not add anything to the proposed text and that fraud should be combated outside the Community Customs Code
