In this case , however , the precautionary principle must be applied .
It is due to this cooperation alone that we were able to reach a good compromise in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy .
Consequently , rather than putting forward my own point of view , I am speaking on behalf of all of those who adopted this compromise .
Fifthly , we believe it is important that the chemicals and aluminium industries should also be included in this directive .
I also share the view that systematic evaluation is a prime instrument to ensure value for money for expenditure from the EU budget .
The Commission report itself is relatively thorough , and the Commission has clearly responded to Parliament 's request for greater speed and urgency in producing it , although it is regrettable that some specific comments made by Parliament in its report last year have still not been taken into account , particularly with regard to information on hearings .
Nevertheless , the Commission proposal on the trading of greenhouse gas emissions allowances has not been sufficiently amended and so we abstained from the vote because we do not accept this principle , and we also have reservations about various other proposals for amendments .
I suppose we could say 'better late than never '.
Hence our abstention from the vote .
All of these reasons prove that there is no sense in keeping the Stability and Growth Pact .
Or is President Prodi going to do so in order to address the aims of sustainable economic development , of more jobs with rights and of greater social inclusion ?
Only those who have been going around with their heads completely in the clouds and divorced from Europe 's economic reality could be surprised today .
I am sure that we all agree on this .
Using the Stability and Growth Pact intelligently , emphasising the pillar of growth in the current economic situation is absolutely crucial for nature not to rebel and for the building that has been constructed so laboriously not to collapse .
I believe that there is an enormous degree of unity between the recommendations contained in Mr Duff 's Report and the conclusions of the working group .
By the same token , the Charter does not in any way limit the competences of the Member States .
The Charter represents the political commitment of the previous Convention , which this Convention must respect .
In this regard I believe that the result achieved by this working group will also receive a very broad consensus .
What we have is not so much a market but a collection of women and men who give this Community meaning .
We therefore support the strategy advocated in this report and its main conclusions : to make it the major part of the new Constitutional Treaty , to lay down formal rules for its revision and , following the explicit attribution of a single legal personality to the European Union , to advocate accession to the European Convention on Human Rights .
And he adds : ' The Charter does not limit the competences of Member States under the Treaties .
We also had , last year , the Cornillet Report in the same field .
I am , therefore , afraid that there is a desire to subvert the rule of law and that this is precisely what we are doing as a result of this ambiguity .
We must therefore find a basis for giving the citizens direct access to the Union 's courts and we must similarly define the mechanisms that will persuade national courts to apply the Charter in the name of the citizens .
Furthermore , no right is being removed from those already enjoyed by the citizens of the Member States , and nor is any higher protection being diluted into a Charter that lays down only minimum rules .
I believe that this directive constitutes the core of the common European asylum system , the need for which was underlined in the Treaty of Amsterdam and in the conclusions of the Tampere , Laeken and Seville Councils .
In order to create a situation of equal treatment , the proposal for a directive on qualification for international protection contains standards for a common definition both of refugees and of those who are entitled to subsidiary protection .
It is therefore extremely important for the Commission that Parliament adopts its position on the directive as rapidly as possible so that the Council can debate this issue in light of your opinion .
We also agree that refugees , like any persons benefiting from other forms of protection , should be able to live with dignity in the Community of which they are a part , which can only happen if we protect their personal and social rights .
Without wishing to dramatise , Mr President , this proposal contains a core of minimum standards that reveal the legislative courage to respond effectively to the issue of citizens of third countries in need of international protection , at the same time eliminating national differences in the way in which persons are treated , avoiding the need for secondary movements .
For the moment , however , a good part of the ground has been covered , as have the bases for a common European asylum policy .
We have also covered rules on subsidiary protection and , on this matter , I should like to put Mr Berthu 's mind at ease : we have created nothing new ; this is not the invention of a Commissioner 's Machiavellian mind .
This process has been opened by the United Nations High Commissioner but we are not in a position unilaterally to amend the Convention
