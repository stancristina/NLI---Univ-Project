Let us allow the Member States to decide on it for themselves in compliance with the subsidiarity principle , and then we will also have the public behind us in European matters .
So I shall say it for the record .
This is primarily about weekend journeys .
Europe 's economy and jobs are inevitably dependent on security of supply , so fiscal support is the right way ahead , as we can expect the production of fuels from biomass to completely replace the import of fuel oil as soon as a few decades hence .
Whilst the two of them are virtually equally profitable , they cannot compete with fuels derived from oil .
The promotion of biofuels fits into the EU 's overall strategy of doubling the penetration of renewable energy sources by 2010 , a strategy for which we have essential reasons .
We have also , Commissioner , tabled a number of amendments .
Madam President , it has to be said that biofuels have immense inherent potential for innovation , with all its positive side-effects , but let us not deceive ourselves about the great initial costs that there will also be to cope with .
Mr President , as is only right , Parliament is largely united on this issue .
Now for the misgivings , which are as follows .
It is surely not enough simply to prefix the word 'fuel ' with 'bio ' and thus create a biofuel that is 100 % biological .
That is why we have a Euratom Safeguards Office ( ESO ) to work very intensively on ensuring that the quantity of such material available is properly checked and monitored , and to work to ensure that such materials are used only for peaceful purposes .
In this area as in others , we will have high expectations of the new ten countries that want to join the EU , and we ought also to consider role the ESO might play in future .
Item 13 makes it very clear that Euratom functions undemocratically , without either transparency or accountability .
Secondly , thanks to the initiative by Commissioner Reding and Parliament , the European Investment Bank has launched a fund to make available for audio-visual works urgently needed risk capital which totals EUR 400 million in this year alone .
The investments envisaged should be made in projects that are necessary for the EU 's economy and that are commercially profitable .
Changes to date in the euro/US dollar exchange rate are thus causing an increase in expenditure of between EUR 400 million and EUR 500 million .
Mr FÃ¤rm had also addressed the question of whether an understanding might already be reached on these .
In the preliminary draft of the Budget , the Commission had set aside an amount to cover these measures both in the Commission and in the other institutions .
It is precisely in the agriculture sector that there are disputes .
Firstly , Commissioner , my view of a supplementary Budget by which we return EUR 15 billion - that is far in excess of 15 % of our Budget - to the Member States , is that it is somewhat comic .
On behalf of our group , I would like to tell you that we are ready , willing and alongside you in the defence of freedom and democracy against terrorism .
We have a great deal of faith in the expected Interinstitutional Agreement , the conclusion of which is being worked on at a high level , not only by experts , but also by politicians , in order to bring about genuinely better lawmaking in the European Union .
It is not one yet , however .
So it must be the concern of Social Democrats that the opportunity to show solidarity , which is the social dimension of modernisation , privatisation and liberalisation , is not lost .
Mr President , the future of this European Union of ours is dependent to a crucial degree on its acceptance by the public , and this is something we must always bear in mind when proposing regulatory schemes .
Mr President , I am really pleased that this report incorporates the proposal by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that it must in future be possible to completely exempt from consumer taxes biofuels and petrol manufactured from biological materials .
Mr President , the Group of the Party of European Socialists supports Mrs Kauppi 's report .
There have recently been less favourable developments in the aggregate money supply , which , however , have a silver lining in that they indicate recovery , being a sign that enterprises are obtaining liquidity for investment in future economic growth , and this , for Europe , is a matter of life and death .
It is no accident that the eurozone finance ministers have already called on the Commission to take more account of cyclical fluctuations when assessing the Member States ' budgetary positions .
In order to ensure maximum freedom of choice for consumers , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy also calls for the labelling of animal products and enzymes .
I think that clarifications of this sort are always welcome .
We know that .
So why label it ?
To fail to adopt comprehensive labelling and , as a result , more detailed traceability , would be a declaration of consumer policy bankruptcy on the part of Parliament and subservience to the interests of genetic engineering .
Basically , letting consumers decide for themselves if they want to eat genetically modified food is a problem , because even highly educated people know very little about the possible side effects .
Enterprises , though , consist of employers and employees .
However , the Czech Republic has notified us of its intention to make further applications
