Mr President , please allow me to thank you on behalf of all Andalusian fishermen , and on my own behalf , for the efforts you are making to persuade the Portuguese authorities to free Agustín García , the fisherman who , as you know , has spent more than two months in prison .
I just want to say one thing , your Presidency has not been a cruise around the Aegean Sea , but rather an 'Odyssey ' . I believe it is fair to say , moreover , that you have captained the European ship with leadership and decisiveness , and I believe this should be stressed at this point .
Of course , we would have liked a constitution with more qualified majority voting in social areas , on taxation , on foreign and security policy and with a better interinstitutional balance .
Now , however , we are in the dramatic situation of having a statute for parties but no statute for Members of Parliament .
Compared to the Seville conclusions , I find it genuinely interesting , although , having heard Mr Borghezio , I am wondering whether my analysis may be mistaken .
Similarly , readmission agreements are just one part of the relationship with third countries .
I am actually delighted with the assessment you have made .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am going to begin by referring briefly to the report by Mrs Klaß in order to support the compromise amendment relating to the official list of ingredients which must appear in Annex IIIa within two years .
Framework Directive 89/107/EEC on additives , in its Annex II , specifies that 'all food additives must be kept under continuous observation and must be re-evaluated whenever necessary ' .
In conclusion , I would like to stress that it is very important that we make consumers aware that thanks to the legislation on additives and the work of the Scientific Committee on Food they can enjoy adequate food safety and food products which are suited to their needs .
In the report which she presented in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy there were many points on which we were in agreement , but Mrs Corbey wanted to go further and , after having reached a compromise , at the last minute she has introduced modifications in Amendments Nos 26 and 27 which have obliged me not to sign them and to vote against them tomorrow .
Can anyone believe that the collection of waste can be carried out on equal terms ?
These three options are better than merely depositing waste in dumps .
We must stress the need to ensure that exporters carry out the process of recovery or recycling under conditions which are not merely similar to those laid down in Community legislation , but exactly equivalent to them .
Personally , as he knows , I have been very critical and I have been a great nuisance to him over some of the amendments approved at first and second readings , above all those which seemed to me to impose excessively rigid conditions on the Member States for the application of the directive and which made it difficult for each State to find and define the best way to fulfil its objectives .
We believe that this first conciliation is of great importance , given that it is the first real exchange of requests and strategies between the three institutions , and I therefore believe we have proposed a conciliation strategy which will be particularly useful and beneficial to the interests of the European Parliament and of the European citizens in general , which is the reason why we are here .
( Applause from the left ) This means that we are obliged to make laws for the general interest and not to resolve specific cases involving a minority .
The doors cannot be closed .
I do not believe that you are proposing that Social Security and pensions should become a European competence - that would go further than what we are saying - but it is important that it be linked to our demographic situation and our future , above all in relation to immigration .
Finally , Mr President , I will refer to foreign policy .
I can assure you , Mr Berlusconi , that we will not be partisan and we will judge your Presidency on the facts , on what you can do , and not just on promises .
The objective is for the IGC , in any event , to begin and end in Rome .
Not because of Italy , of course , the foundation of our culture , of many of our languages and of the very idea of Europe , but because of the political personality of President Berlusconi .
You underplayed the constant deaths of immigrants , off both our coasts and in your island of Sicily .
The European Union must contribute its own approach to the fight against terrorism , particularly since we have seen recently that the military approach has its limitations .
Do not raise the tone by bringing the problems you cannot resolve nationally to the seat of the European Union .
This means that the defence of human rights is an absolute and that , if the main violation of human rights is terrorism itself , which does not respect the basic right to life , that does not mean that we must not always be aware , in any action or fight against terrorism , that human rights are a fundamental element which must be respected at all times .
Furthermore , although the Russian authorities have assured us that they will not repatriate the thousands of displaced persons in neighbouring areas to Chechnya by force , referred to a moment ago by the President-in-Office of the Council , the truth is that ECHO has
