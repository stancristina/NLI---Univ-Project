specific timetables .
I should like , therefore , to ask the Commissioner to convey to the Commission our position that it is not possible for the European Union to reliably exert pressure on the members of the UN to vote for a special convention which will also be binding on developing and poorer countries when the more developed world refuses to set an example in this endeavour .
Mr President , Commissioner , preventing and combating violence against women and children is a high priority for the committee which I have the honour of chairing and we are fighting for it to be placed at the top of the European Union 's agenda .
Of course , this matter would not have received so much publicity in the international press were it not about the daughter of the famous French actor Jean-Louis Trintignant .
We know that Marie Trintignant was battered to death by her French partner , the musician Bertrand Cantat .
In addition , as flows of immigrants have increased over recent years , we know that thousands of women and children within Europe are the victim of the new form of slavery , trafficking for profit and sexual exploitation .
Mr President , I think that our rapporteur , Mrs Gr√∂ner , has set out our claims in detail and her report is truly excellent .
Our ambition with DAPHNE ? ? is to raise public awareness in a broader and more systematic way , to improve research into the causes of and practical solutions to the problems and to get closer to target groups and individuals .
This money , if used properly , will be sufficient .
Violence is a global phenomenon and we are very concerned about the policy we need to apply to combat it in the countries with which we have association agreements and other forms of commercial cooperation , but this needs to be done on the basis of other , special policies .
Those promoting the anti-grass roots policy have the nerve to call by the name of 'constitution ' a text which not only fails to crystallise the democratic achievements of the people , but also reduces them to a text which establishes capitalism constitutionally , which redistributes power for the benefit of the strong , which hands over more national sovereignty to the imperialist , Euro-unifying centre and which dangerously extends the militarisation of the European Union .
Nor are we surprised at the lack of substantial information on the content of the 'constitution ' . Despite the propaganda campaign , the people must not be deceived .
( EL ) Mr President , in paragraphs 9 , 10 and 11 , it says that Parliament calls on ' ... the Convention and the IGC... ' .
( EL ) It is important to set criteria , preconditions and limits in the matter of the employment of seafarers from third countries on Community ships .
This imposes an evaluation of the training system of each country , so that certificates of competency can be issued - and not simply an approach on an individualised basis - which will be valid for five years .
( EL ) The Commission proposal promotes the legalisation of the unacceptable and dangerous deterioration in maritime training , satisfying the decision by big shipping business to increase its profits at the expense of the safety of the very lives of seafarers , shipping and the environment .
However , this requires a total break with big shipping business , a break that the EU cannot and does not want .
.
( EL ) Behind the ostensibly neutral title 'on legal bases and compliance with Community law' , the own-initiative report by the Committee on Legal Affairs hides the complete subjugation of national law to Community law .
The report also proposes that the Commission should be able to appear in national criminal courts in order to bring civil actions and even to force the Member States to impose prison sentences decided by the Community .
It will only change with the immediate withdrawal of the occupying armies , so that the Iraqi people can take their fate in their own hands , and on payment by the invaders of the compensation needed in order to reconstruct Iraq .
It is certain that the resistance of the Iraqi people against the conquerors , under any guise , will continue with increasing international solidarity .
The problem , of course , is that the peoples suffering the 'benevolence ' of the European Union and its imperialist friends insist on resisting their liberators .
Even religious freedom is being used for this purpose , while the Turco resolution reaches the point of proposing an 'offshore ' law with punishments and sanctions in accordance with the US standard .
This is an urgent matter .
.
It is unacceptable for there still to be professional sectors and areas in the European Union in which Community legislation , democratic rules and fundamental freedoms only apply to men .
Only then will we be able to talk of the universality of human rights and mainstreaming .
Thank you Minister .
Although I expected some sort of denial , in other words that no such statement was made on the part of the Italian Government , I want to believe that its position is that expressed by the Minister and not that expressed in the article in the Financial Times .
There is a legal problem with the detainees , but there is also a problem with their fundamental rights , their inability to communicate with their families , with drinking water , sanitation and so on .
I take the same view of minority languages .
It is therefore important for our strategies as regards minority languages to be characterised by an open spirit of cooperation , by scientific research and association with the wealth of cultural elements which surround them
