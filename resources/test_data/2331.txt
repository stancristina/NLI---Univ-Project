Mrs Roure raised another important issue , that of what progress we have achieved with the other instruments , essentially the European evidence procedure and the exchange of information between judicial authorities .
The Council is observing the situation as regards the detained opposition leaders , representatives of civil society organisations , newspaper publishers and journalists with close attention .
Nevertheless , we believe that dialogue is the only alternative open to us , as breaking off dialogue and ‘punishing civil society’ , as it were , is certainly not a viable option .
I should like to say in reply that the Council has always emphasised that it gives absolute priority to respect for human rights , and that the Council is also actively promoting the prevention and eradication of torture and other forms of cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment , with particular regard to Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union and the relevant EU guidelines .
I see this as a very great benefit , and for that reason it is also important to continue the discussion in one way or another .
Further to Parliament’s positive opinion in December 2005 , it proved possible to reach political agreement on this regulation as early as 21 February 2006 , at the most recent Justice and Home Affairs Council .
That is another crucial aspect .
Subsequently , on 24 February 2005 , the Council instructed its working party on substantive criminal law to continue the discussions on the proposal .
The Council’s ad hoc working party on fundamental rights and citizenship is currently examining the proposal for a regulation presented by the Commission in June 2005 .
What are the Commissioner’s views on interest-rate policy in relation to the Stability and Growth Pact ?     – Madam President , like all his colleagues , the Commissioner speaks of simplification , and these complicated European procedures are a major point of contention .
The Commissioner has said today that he is committed to a dialogue with Parliament .
We have heard some very fundamental , harsh criticism of the bureaucratic procedures .
Our most important amendments will be put to a roll-call vote tomorrow .
This item , too , remains on Parliament’s agenda .
As I am warning against hasty conclusions , at a time like this it is worth reminding ourselves of the principles .
It would have been good if Mr Abbas had been able to take advantage of this situation , but that has now been postponed .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the fact that Mahmoud Abbas was unable to speak here is not tragic , but hard to tolerate politically , because this would have been a forum for presenting a perspective of the current situation in the Middle East .
I would therefore say to everyone here : we must not deceive ourselves .
On the other hand , Fatah 's actions in Gaza showed that those who were previously in favour of the renunciation of violence under Mr Abbas are taking on a new role now that they have lost the elections and have lost their sources of profit .
In this context , I would also agree with Mr Cohn-Bendit that we need to prevent and avoid unilateral action .
It goes without saying that the best way of ensuring the success of such a venture is to prepare thoroughly , and the Council formations responsible for the various topics have therefore examined the priorities of the European Council from their perspective and submitted their contributions .
This would then reduce unemployment by almost one percentage point in 2007 .
The focus following the major changes last year should now be on more action and more continuity .
It would be a good idea for the resources available from the European Union to rise in step with our own national efforts .
Within the European Council itself , we want to pay particular attention to combating youth unemployment .
I call on the Heads of State or Government and on the governments to take Parliament 's efforts regarding the Services Directive as their example .
It was the right step to take , but what has happened since then ?
The troika is ruled by penny-pinchers , scraping together every last Euro so that the money cannot be given to Europe .
This was very clear in Mr Winkler 's speech .
With regard to the market , Mr Barroso , I have one request : trust Mrs Kroes 's proposals from last week .
Fourthly , I also call for codecision with the European Parliament on all internal-market related issues , on issues of growth and employment and on the financial perspective .
The third freedom , of the provision of services , is also at risk .
My only complaint is about something that many speakers have already mentioned .
What is done always reflects the idea that social security benefits have some sort of adverse effect on a national economy , yet they do no such thing ; they do it some good !
Mr Watson , I certainly agree with you that there are many subjects which the European Council ought to deal with , but with limited time not everything can be dealt with .
We , together with the Commission , are determined to take the right steps towards taking this action .     .
The Commission notes with concern the renationalisation of economic thinking in some parts of the European Union and warns against it , for – as almost all speakers today have said – the right way is to address Europe’s problems together .
If you wanted to get them to sit down , you ought to have wielded the gavel .
It is high time that it faced up to its responsibility and desisted from further enlargements , to which these developments are in part attributable , and got back to being more concerned about social
