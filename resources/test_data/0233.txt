To conclude , Mr President , I would like to ask both Council and Commission to work in closer contact with the European Parliament so that the three pillars on which the Union is founded can be constructed , in a joint , parallel and speedy manner , but above all along the lines desired by the citizens .
I apologize , but the approval of this measure has required very tight deadlines .
I therefore insist that we proceed as requested by the committee .
As mayor of an Italian municipality and aware of all the actions aimed at improving the efficiency of the public authorities , I appreciate the European Commission 's decision to consider the training of human resources to be a priority objective of the programme and , agreeing with Mr Secchi , I believe it advisable for training to be provided by exchanges arranged between officials of different tax authorities .
Enough is enough .
Finally , Mr President , I wish to make one further consideration : why , when we face the question of Iraq , do we not talk about the Kurds as well ?
The fact that President Eyadema has been in power for thirty years now and seems intent on not calling his own role into discussion is clearly an obstacle to the full implementation of real democracy in the country .
It is no longer the Marxist logic that is penetrating the countries , destabilizing them and causing them to fall , one after the other , but a gradual and not as slow a destabilization of the entire continent .
After Rwanda , Burundi , Zaire and Congo , Togo is still today in a state of crisis .
Three people were responsible for the crime , with instincts more bestial than human ; three people who hid their baseness and perversion behind a facade of social respectability .
Madam President , it is with heavy hearts that we again raise our voices in defence of the human rights of a political prisoner in the United States : the Italian and European citizen Silvia Baraldini , ailing in the penitentiary of Danbury , Connecticut , after having served fourteen and a half years of a 43-year sentence for a youthful association with a revolutionary Afro-American movement .
During her long detention she has been operated on twice for cancer of the uterus .
With every day that passes without the problem of Silvia Baraldini 's transfer to an Italian prison being resolved , the internal and international credibility of the United States and its legal system become more compromised .
For these reasons , on behalf of my group as well , I support the proposed resolution submitted by Mr Manisco .
The social fund is the only fund that is directly beneficial to people and against social exclusion and it is the only direct line , the only incentive we have to exploit the human capital that may enable us to incorporate both competitiveness and social guarantees .
In the sensitive sectors , such as that of polluting agents and noise emissions , the Council and the Commission have agreed , in the context of a declaration set out in the Council documents , that the adoption of measures in these sectors should take place , at Community level , in accordance with the provisions of articles 100a and 189b and that the procedure for the adoption of an amendment to a regulation will only take place after completing that process .
Is it familiar with the text of the commitment assumed by the Luxembourgian Presidency and , if so , what is its position in that connection ?
That is , in fact , the incentive we wish to provide , as it is in fact small and medium budget productions or coproductions which do not have access to private market loans , except at a very high cost .
A Commission proposal on satellite monitoring has also been accepted as a CCAMLR resolution .
The Commission has to confirm that the last meeting held by the CCAMLR presented positive aspects for countries with a great interest in fishing in that region which obviously had a more resistant attitude .
The renewal of the protocol brings several changes based on the current rate of use of fishing possibilities ; thus cephalopod and demersal fishing , which has fallen by 1 , 000 tonnes gross tonnage , has been adapted to the smaller catch volume of previous years , which only amounts to 20 % of the possibilities negotiated by the Community .
With regard to prawn fishing , the Community fleet had used around 93 % and this justifies the increase of 800 tonnes gross tonnage agreed by this protocol .
Mr President , as I cannot go into the substance , I will restrict myself to saying that the Committee on Fisheries and Parliament as a whole constantly deplore various aspects of the agreements submitted to us , and these aspects have been pointed out today by Mr Kindermann and Mr JÃ¶ns : the costs , the fact that Parliament is only involved in the consultation procedure , apart from the agreements with Morocco , and the impact of these agreements on fish stocks and the local fishing community .
On two specific points in particular , the Commission has undertaken to make an overall assessment of the fisheries agreements during the forthcoming year .
Still with regard to Equatorial Guinea , I would like to say that ECU 170 , 000 allocated to strengthening controls is a large sum for that country , and we will have to make a great deal of effort to use such a large sum which that country may not know how to use .
I think I have responded to a series of problems ; I hope , however , that the considerable effort
