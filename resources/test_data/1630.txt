My question to the Commission is : How can we put this right ?
How can we improve the controls ?
Mr President , this Directive concerns our working lives and the regulations which will apply to them .
It is precisely this which is so difficult to determine as there are so many different types of inhalation and many different environmental problems .
But the Directive is a step in the right direction , which is a good thing as it concerns the level of health and safety we want in our workplaces .
One of the reasons for this has been the dominance of orthodox economic theories in economic policy .
The report breaks with orthodox opinion which is otherwise the hallmark of debate in the European Union and its institutions .
We must establish a new freer currency co-operation on a more global basis .
For example , it states that interest rates have never been as low as they are now and that the difference between the interest rates in Sweden and Germany has never been so small as now , but this is totally untrue .
The level of savings rose , demand fell and the rate of growth fell as well .
It was when Sweden ended their Keynesian demand policy , when we started to fight inflation before fighting unemployment , when we started to apply the convergence criteria , or to put it briefly , when we adopted the new liberal policy recommended by the Commission , that Sweden began to have problems .
Unfortunately , the many errors in the report makes me fear that it will be some time before this realisation hits home .
This could give information on whether the driver wears glasses for example , or the restrictions placed on a handicapped driver , or if a driver may only drive under certain conditions for medical reasons .
It could also give information on any technical changes to a car which are required in order that the holder of the licence may drive , for example reconstruction of the gear box , clutch , brakes or accelerator , an adapted control unit or other restrictions which a vehicle may have .
This is of particular importance as people travel across ever more borders and more frequently drive in countries other than the country in which they themselves live .
We do this in accordance with the position we have adopted on this throughout the work .
Simply to add a short addendum is scarcely to be recommended .
The second mistake which I think that the rapporteur has made concerns the subject matter itself , i .e . do we really want the same rules governing the withdrawal of driving licences in the EU.
My vision is that the EU should concern itself with a limited number of extremely important issues .
We must make a distinction between those things which ought to be determined by the EU and those things which should be determined by the countries themselves .
In the report which is produced every year both for this House and for the public we have clearly and distinctly shown that there are irregularities in both Southern and Northern States within the European Union .
It is true that the Member States within the Union are not very good at ensuring that payments which have ended up in the wrong pockets are repaid .
Let me thank Commissioner Van den Broek for his answer .
Today we are discussing the costs of enlargement which form a considerable barrier to that very enlargement .
There is a risk that enlargement towards the east will become harder .
We now know more about this issue due to what has recently been written in the World Fisheries ' Report , where it was stated that there are plans for both duties and special penalty taxes .
I ask therefore : is there any possibility of using this penalty tax to compensate fish farmers for the damage that they have suffered as a result of imports from Norway .
Another suggestion would be for the EU to adopt certain fundamental positions , for example , concerning jobs , integration projects between different countries i .e . co-operation on integration and the environment : fundamental principles governing the use of the Structural Funds , with the aim of balancing regional injustices of course .
Is this something which the Commissioner has considered and which may perhaps be included in the improvements now being talked about ?
Unfortunately the update shows that no improvements have taken place since then .
Has such a proposal for beef been put to the executive committee ?
I would also like to ask another question in this connection .
It is not really the legislative work in this House which is affected .
As many earlier speakers have already said , it has not produced many results so far .
We have really only seen any form of result in two of the pilot projects .
Why did we start with building products when we know that the Community has tried for years to simplify this sector ?
The legal committee would like to see procurement subjected to a method of slimming which is more lasting than the slimming methods found in women 's magazines in the spring .
I hope also that the management of the Commission pay attention to the fact that there can be considerable opposition at a lower level from Commission staff .
Mr President , I would like to see young artists given good opportunities to work in Europe .
If we were to have internationally binding regulations and resale rights which applied in every country which had signed the Copyright Convention the situation would be different .
Another consequence of resale rights is that the galleries have started to experience an even tougher time and
