This path does not mean we need not concentrate on the political and social dimension of European integration ; on the contrary , that is what it requires .
At this point , for the sake of political openness and responsibility , I propose to make an express statement of the reasons for the position I have taken on the creation of the single currency .
It also demands a European taxation policy and an EU budget designed to ensure economic and social cohesion .
For Europe this has created a magnificent symbol of identity , a lever to give us power in the world and a means of economic development , intra-European cohesion and solidarity between citizens .
I have been the only Portuguese Member on the European Parliament 's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy in an active capacity from the beginning of the legislative process .
That is why I have voted in favour of the decision on the eleven countries to be included in the third stage of EMU as from 1 January 1999 .
Let us go on gradually reducing production subsidies and adopt the common position of the Council in relation to the prohibition of tobacco advertising .
Although we have some reservations - especially as regards the creation of special supra-institutional units , a proposal we consider particularly negative , and also as regards the question of harmonizing legislation - we consider the report generally positive , because it faces up to the use of synthetic drugs , which has become a part of the world-wide drugs problem as a whole .
But there is one aspect on which we differ : I refer to the question of copper .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to express my general support for Mr Collins 's report , particularly as regards water quality .
We consider that the Commission has not changed its position .
The question is this : if we accept that the Commissioner 's information on the hazardous nature of copper is correct , then some other products will have to be substituted for it .
This general emphasis is also apparent in the draft mandate the Commission has put before Parliament and the Council , which is now being debated , and which relates to a new partnership with the ACP countries .
That support is designed to assist with development , particularly in terms of orthopaedic clinics , medical supplies . infrastructures , professional training schemes and health projects for victims of mines and burns , among others .
I believe that among the main actions that are being carried out , especially regarding the health system , disability is being addressed .
And this is true not just for a few people , but for people of all classes and all ages .
Firstly , the ' Europe of knowledge ' must of course be the whole of Europe .
I would specify three : a visible increase in financial resources , indexing them at a minimum percentage of the Community budget immediately ; rapid general availability of access to the new technologies from primary school age ; and a bold language programme - this is very important - consisting of teaching two foreign languages from the elementary stage onwards , a European language which can be used as a common means of communication between all citizens , reinforced by a second language , not forgetting that non-European languages are increasingly being spoken in Europe .
This will contribute to the restoration of the emphasis on economic relations between the two parties , although we must express our concern at the relative loss we have been sustaining as a commercial partner .
Our political concern , as expressed later in Article 1 , should serve to dispel the reservations expressed by some in the light of the difficulties experienced by the country 's authorities .
It will be a new reference currency of great economic potency , and I very much hope the euro will help to turn that into great political potency .
But the interviews we conducted enabled us to obtain the necessary assurances that all members of the Executive Board , especially the President , Wim Duisenberg , will recognise that the legitimacy and credibility of the European Central Bank and the strength of the euro will depend for their security on the quality of the accounts submitted to the European Parliament and the seriousness of the monetary dialogue they will set up with us .
The appointment of the President of the ECB has already been ratified by the markets and public opinion - and that is a very important evaluation factor , on the democratic as well as the economic level .
After the 'foundation ' and the appointment of the 'founder members ' of the euro , the process of installing the first Executive Board of the ECB exceeded our worst fears , displaying a totally undesirable degree of short-sightedness and opportunism .
And I will not tolerate that .
The current edition of the Customs Code once again reflects the general attitude .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , my colleague Mr Caudron 's report reflects the view of the competitiveness which the Commission defends and is trying to impose horizontally .
This is the only way we can hope to exploit to the full the possibilities the market offers .
Members of the European Parliament , as representatives of all European citizens , should therefore be concerned not only with people in work but also with those who are unemployed , young people in search of their first jobs in many cases .
Furthermore all observers , whether in favour or critical of the European Union , have pointed out that monetary union is dangerous without effective coordination of economic policies within the Union , and without a
