he was appointed to take on .
I now see before me a Commission that will be in a position to fight for gender equality and protection of the rights of minorities , a Commission that will be able to fight for reforms in Europe .
I myself attended the hearing of , among others , the Budget Commissioner-designate , and that was an excellent experience in which no punches were pulled in connection with the issue of the necessary reforms .
I look forward to our cooperation .
Everyone looks after his or her own interests , and each Head of State will be measured and assessed on how well allowance has been made for narrow interests in the final result of the negotiation .
There is , of course , quite a lot that the European Parliament needs to say .     Mr President , I should like to add to the criticism expressed in this House .
I turn firstly to its substance .
Yes , says the Council , and the report submissively concurs , of course , irrespective of the fact that these demands are synonymous with a huge extension of the police surveillance that the EU has been developing in recent years .
A number of significant encroachments upon people’s rights are to be introduced without the remotest evidence that these encroachments are of any use at all in achieving the objective .
The operation was successful , but the patient died , as we say in Denmark .
In recent days , this scandal has taken on the character of a farce .
The consultation of Parliament , ostensibly based upon Article 67 of the EC Treaty , is clearly inadequate , and a future Council decision would therefore be invalid .
It is not merely a question of having to make a few economic adjustments , but of Turkey and the EU being two widely different civilisations whose values are incompatible .
That is not , however , the way in which the majority of the European Parliament thinks .
In this way , the EU is trying to change us all , and the majority in this House believes that the Turks can be changed in the same way .
The Turks do not want to be Germans , a fact that we can , of course , see clearly in Germany .
What the EU is saying is , in actual fact , that Turkey should give up its Muslim culture .
That is something , of course , which Turkey cannot , however , do .
A country ’s culture cannot be taken away from it ; or , rather , any attempt to do so takes centuries .
That is why the demands will hardly be fulfilled ; but , in ten years ’ time , this Parliament will adopt a splendid report to the effect that the demands have been fulfilled , irrespective of the fact that everyone knows that that is not the case .
The strongest opponents are the Greek Cypriots , who are the European people that has most recently been at war with Turkey and the northern part of whose country is still occupied by Turkey .
Cyprus is directly threatened with exclusion …     Mr President , firstly , I wish to express my support for Mr Eurlings ’ report and acknowledge the large amount of work that has gone into it .
I always prefer to focus on the positive agenda .
Communism was kept at bay , partly thanks to Turkish loyalty towards the NATO Pact .
There are substantial benefits to be had in terms of security policy from speeding up Turkey’s integration into Europe .
I would therefore call upon us to act in the forthcoming process on the basis of Turkey’s being ‘a friend of Europe’ .
Turkey is an asset to Europe and not a burden upon it .
Some people have expressed reservations about accepting such a large Muslim country into the EU.
The EU is not a religious club ; the common denominator is democracy , not religion .
In actual fact , Turkey has already obtained every possible agreement prior to actual membership .
We must ask ourselves : ‘Can we bring ourselves to do such a thing ?’ .
What can be said to an applicant country ?
That does not make any sense .
Whether or not Turkey ultimately becomes a Member depends upon whether the Turks themselves are prepared to implement the far-reaching changes to their society that are required if Turkey is really to become a Member .
There is plenty here to set to work on , especially when it comes to human rights .
Let us be open and unprejudiced in our encounter with the population of Turkey , and let us join together in combating intolerance where this may be found .
As Chairman of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament , I should also like to start by expressing my support for Mr Eurlings ’ report , which I think is a balanced document , as well as a responsible one in a way that is absolutely crucial .
There is no doubt that Turkey has made a very great deal of progress such as it would scarcely have made if there had been no prospect – a prospect made use of many times in the Turkish Parliament – of Turkey’s being accorded candidate status .
I do not think it would be right of us today or tomorrow to take decisions as to whether it will be .
That leads to the issue to which I wish to devote the rest of my speaking time .
That is not without its problems .
That is very serious , because the present situation is not in accordance with freedom of expression and organisation , and I hope that Mr Rehn will take the matter seriously and inform Turkey that it must come into line
