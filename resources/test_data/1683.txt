perspectives and must seek to set more ambitious targets as regards the EU’s budgetary resources .
Those measures will make a contribution towards ensuring responsible fishing in the Indian Ocean .     .
The issue here is the conclusion of another fishing agreement between the EU and various Indian Ocean countries , in this case Mauritius .
I voted in favour of the report by Mr Morillion on the proposal for a Council regulation on the conclusion of the Protocol defining for the period 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2006 the tuna fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Democratic Republic of Madagascar on fishing off Madagascar , because I am in favour of responsible and sustainable fishing .
In practice , it will be forbidden to make any further agreements , such as bilateral agreements , which strikes us as excessive and also constitutes interference in the internal politics of individual Member States .
Otherwise , the balance of resources and his assertion that coastal communities must benefit from this Protocol will be in jeopardy .
The report focuses mainly on tuna , but also covers demersal species .
Like the rapporteur , I feel that this commitment by the Commission is opportune and welcome .
Consequently , new approaches to cooperation are needed that go beyond bloody-minded unilateral acts , which are no longer acceptable and are little more than representations of outdated debate , as has already been said in this House .
We must also support the Interim Government’s intention to press ahead , in spite of all the difficulties , with preparations for free and democratic elections in January 2005 .
We are now measuring the time in terms of years ; the weapons never existed ( as we knew ) ; a country is being occupied against the will of its people , who are resisting ; the war goes on , in increasingly dramatic fashion ; the casualty figures mount up , from dozens , with names and faces , to thousands , who are anonymous and do not count towards the statistics .
This justifies , albeit belatedly , the criticisms that we have made from the very outset .
In order to safeguard economic and social development , it should be replaced by a pact that genuinely helps to create jobs and to foster social progress , a pact that prioritises social economic cohesion , jobs and social inclusion .     Mr President , I would briefly like to say that we have all come to the European Union because we share the same constitutional values .
They must mobilise themselves in this joint task of involving the public in objective and genuine debate on the reasons behind the Constitution , which is purely and simply an extension of the constitutional convergence between different States .
Even a constitutional debate offers an opportunity to people with that parochial mentality , people who are incapable of grasping what is at stake .
Supranational institutions do not lay themselves open to the charge of interfering in the internal democratic process of States and therefore have a greater responsibility in fighting for the approval of the Constitution .     The debate on these questions put by Parliament to the Council demonstrates that rather than ensuring a frank , clear and illuminating debate , in which different political opinions and arguments are aired on the Constitutional Treaty , Parliament has reacted tentatively and fearfully towards the national referendums that have been announced .
This is because of the continued existence of an unjust and disgraceful law that takes no account of social reality or of the reasons why women turn to abortion .
It was also recommended that , in order to safeguard reproductive health and women’s rights , voluntary interruption of pregnancy should be legal , safe and universally accessible .
In the case in question , a Portuguese court ruled that the Portuguese Government had acted within the law .
In a recent referendum , it was decided that it should not be changed .
That was until they helped people to obtain and take medicines that are prescription-only because of their potentially harmful side effects .
This really is an appalling violation of human rights , which Parliament should condemn outright .
The Commission and Parliament cannot and must not remain indifferent when men and women belonging to a non-governmental organisation from one Member State , invited by an NGO from another Member State , with the aim of jointly promoting awareness-raising activities on sexual and reproductive health , have been compared to drug traffickers , illegal fishermen or smugglers .
The Portuguese Government prevented the free movement of European citizens within the European area , by means of deliberate obstruction , in order to prevent an awkward debate for the ruling coalition .
We are not debating why Portuguese women have to go to Spain to have abortions that could be carried out in Portugal , or why those without the means to go to Spain have back-street abortions , which is a matter of concern for Portuguese public health .
What we are actually discussing here is whether it is legitimate in Europe – because this is a European issue – for a military corvette to confront three men and three women on the high seas and prevent them from reaching a Portuguese port , when they were on a legal vessel and were providing a medical service that has been duly legalised in another Member State .
I am not talking about the RU-486 pill , which , as in many EU countries , is not licensed in Portugal and which was being transported on the ship , but about the irresponsible acquisition and use of medicines that can be obtained in pharmacies , albeit subject to certain restrictions .
