Farming is in crisis and will have to stretch itself even further to comply with the rules of the WTO , which is now meeting in Doha .
I would like to thank the Swedish and Belgian Presidencies , the European Commission , Commissioner Busquin , Mr Westendorp , the Secretariat of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy , the ITER Committee , the administrators of the different groups , my assistant GaÃ«lle Le Bouler , the shadow rapporteurs of the ITER Committee , the draftsmen of the opinion , the shadow draftsmen of the committees consulted and the group coordinators .
But , at the same time , we have all declared that we should take into consideration another aspect of added value : the added value of giving research a European dimension .
Lastly , the majority of the Committee on Industry agreed on the importance of research on nuclear fusion .
I would like to finish where I began , by thanking all those involved in this splendid project .
The Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport welcomes it for a number of reasons .
I have been involved in drawing up reports which have gradually transformed the notion of centres of excellence .
In my opinion , this report on the Sixth Framework Programme on European Research is the big report of the moment , despite its faults .
Furthermore , such research is now no longer required because encouraging results have been obtained through the use of adult stem cells to treat incurable diseases .
Indeed , given that it ushers in a new order , the one previously in place is bound to collapse .
I would like to add my voice to those who have congratulated Mr Caudron , the rapporteur .
This can be because they are already there in the proposal .
Clearly , provision has already been made for this , as Mrs McNally pointed out .
The basic thought is indeed to make it possible for the more classical instruments currently in place to be used alongside the new , more integrating instruments for a specific period .
In this way it will be possible to maintain the potential for present and future research .
This is so as not to go beyond real needs insofar as they can be calculated , but also so as not to completely starve of resources the activities under the so-called eighth priority .
The text the Commission proposes to insert into the decision specifically excludes from Community funding research aimed at creating human embryos purely for research purposes or in order to create stem cells .
The management of framework programmes has come in for criticism and rightly so .
Obviously , it follows that in the next few days specific programmes will be adjusted to bring them into line with any amendments adopted .
Mr President , as I understand it , adopting the Committee ' s amendment on the same issue invalidates the other two amendments .
Calling this fundamental principle into question in many Member States , possibly even going as far as constitutional recognition , is detrimental to free choice and , more importantly , to the free organisation of local public services , thus affecting service itself .
The proposal clearly states that its aim is to develop competition in the field of transport provision .
On these two points , the report and the directive contradict the 'maritime safety ' and environmental risk reduction reinforcement policy launched by the European Union following the Erika disaster .
The long amendment war that took place within the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism may have meant for now that competition will no longer be within ports but between them , but these results are not satisfactory .
However , account must be taken of the specific nature of each activity .
- ( FR ) As a member of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy and of the Temporary Committee on Human Genetics ( ' Bioethics ' ) , I have attached particular importance to this report , in its two main aspects : the conditions for support granted to research in Europe , and the ethical framework within which the European Parliament plans to conduct it .
In concrete terms , the European Union 's strategy towards Afghanistan follows five broad lines : attaching priority to emergency humanitarian aid , the central role of the UN , the quest for a just and lasting internal political settlement , the importance of a reconstruction plan for the country and , lastly , the need to give the stabilisation plan a regional dimension .
It also believes that this will be a long-term undertaking that will require a long-term commitment by those participating in the plan .
While the Afghans must , of course , themselves decide who will govern in the future , at the same time , all the other countries in the region will have to feel reassured by this new Afghan government .
As a member of the anti-terrorist coalition , it will continue its action to combat all forms of support for international terrorism .
Meanwhile , we are trying to ensure that the EUR 52 million in aid allocated under the ECHO programme for 2001 and the EUR 22.5 million earmarked in 2001 for displaced persons will indeed reach those who need it .
The Union has already taken an important trade decision by improving the access of Pakistani exports to Europe and we hope we will soon be able to conclude a free-trade agreement with the six Gulf Cooperation Council states .
Firstly , the fighting is , alas , not yet at an end .
It is high time this martyred population was offered stability , dignity
