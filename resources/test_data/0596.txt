60 to be taken between Nos 52 and 62 if it comes to that .
Mr Sterckx and the rapporteur are agreeable to that .
I wholeheartedly support this report by Mr Staes on the organisation of official inspections in the field of animal nutrition .
It allows the Commission to take safeguard measures in emergency situations without consulting Member States , and thus significantly increases the speed and efficiency with which cases can be dealt .
The change from requiring " all necessary assistance " to "full assistance " from Member States , and the fact that the European Parliament has to be kept informed as to results , also indicate that this report is of genuine significance for all Member States .
I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on an excellent report .
I think we must ensure everyone has the most efficient postal service possible ; to do otherwise would not be in the best interest of our constituents .
It is not good enough to call for liberalisation without realising the effects of our decisions .
Rural areas do require the benefit of postal service .
It is a most important and necessary requirement to ensure and stabilise the rural economy .
I feel we have achieved the necessary balance and we can allow the service to develop at an acceptable pace that will give everyone what they need and require .
Mr President , the British Labour Members welcome the passage of the Dary report on the organisation of the banana market .
We hope there will now be speedy negotiations to agree arrangements compatible with our WTO commitments and safeguard our traditional suppliers .
We have , however , reservations on Amendments Nos 6 , 7 , 11 , 15 , 16 , 25 and 26 , as we do not exclude the possibility of a tariff-only system in the future .
We also have reservations on Amendments Nos 17 , 18 , 27 , 30 and 31 , being not convinced that they are WTO compatible .
We hope the passage of the report will also lead to early suspension of the trade sanctions imposed by the USA , which operate in quite arbitrary and unrelated sectors .
I welcome this report by my colleague , Neena Gill .
Although 70 % of Internet content is in English , the challenge to Europe is to exploit its linguistic wealth more fully .
This entails the need for a language industry which concentrates on linguistic customisation and diversifies the language infrastructure of electronic content .
This report contains many excellent ideas as to how these goals may be brought about for the benefit of all Member States , and I fully support it .
I voted against the joint resolution due to elements it contains which have been consistently opposed by the UK Conservative Party .
It should , however , be emphasised that the strong endorsement of EU enlargement , highlighted by Amendment 1 , which was adopted , I wholeheartedly subscribe to .
Given the fundamental importance of the decisions to be taken at the Nice Summit , credit must be given where credit is due .
Each Member State , big and small , had its own priorities , its own objectives .
That is natural .
The fact that an agreement was reached on very difficult issues should not be underestimated .
It was a huge task .
The basis for the future enlargement of the European Union has been laid down .
The negotiations were tough but the strength of the Union was shown in the fact that there was a determination to find solutions agreeable to all .
In the spirit of compromise , a way forward was found .
The resolution on Nice , voted today , does not reflect this .
I abstained on the final vote as I believe Parliament fails to recognise the achievements of Nice .
The tone of the resolution is negative .
It does not reflect the positive outcome of the summit .
The Charter of Fundamental Rights was proclaimed .
Such rights are already very well safeguarded in Ireland 's own Constitution .
Important decisions were taken on social and economic issues , the establishment of the European Food Authority and the impact of the BSE crisis was considered .
As a result of the intervention of Ireland 's Prime Minister , the Commission has been mandated to analyse the situation now confronting beef producers and will make the necessary proposals as soon as possible to find a way to compensate beef producers for the fall in prices .
The Applicant States were reassured of our determination to advance the enlargement process .
The text says the Heads of State gave priority to short-term national interests rather than EU interests .
I do not agree .
What was agreed was agreed in the best interests of Europe and the Member States .
Opting now for a Convention or a European constitution is premature .
A balance was found at Nice and the Heads of Government and State must be congratulated on this .
This was one of the most protracted issues and difficult elements of the negotiations .
Despite the successful efforts of the Nice Summit in this area , the resolution expresses dissatisfaction with the new extension of the scope of qualified majority .
In other words , what Parliament wants is control over taxation and social security issues .
The Nice Summit properly reflects the interests of the Member States in this area .
The Greens ' amendment makes it clear that what they want is codecision on agriculture .
This is not our position .
Mr President , I should like to comment in a very favourable light on Mr Markov 's report and to congratulate him on putting such a constructive report before the House .
I find I am in very substantial agreement with most of the points he includes in his document
