without waiting four years , because the terrorists for their part will not wait that long .
So I would ask you whether we could change the vote on Thursday and delete this heading .
The purpose of this range of dialogues is to draw up public recommendations addressed to the Commission and to the US government , which , on a rotational basis , present their recommendations to the political leaders at the EU-US summits .
This dialogue is important because the European and American business world is putting a considerable effort into this , which is commensurate with the importance of our trade relations with America .
However , I do not think that it is a catastrophe to slightly restrict the number of participants at such conferences .
I myself had many intensive discussions with these representatives during the conference , and also with the representatives of other organisations from European civil society , who were not , strictly speaking , part of our delegation .
I therefore feel that , from this perspective , things were much better at Doha than at Seattle .
Mr Rübig , I am very much in favour of the suggestion to organise , structure and make more permanent the consultation between the governments and the WTO , to set up an organisation and parliamentary structure which could be derived from the Inter-Parliamentary Union .
The second great cliché is that Europe would have held out , but was abandoned by Japan .
The insurance companies will not immediately be able to appropriate this large market for themselves .
After Doha , therefore , we are left with the following situation : the European agricultural model has been broken up , the European cultural exception has been forgotten , and the long-term European social model is at risk .
In reality , what happened at Doha was more like a cynical play at the theatre .
Let us show humility , let us take up our pilgrim ' s staff again , let us listen to them and try to understand them , so that we can take their real concerns into consideration , and above all let us stop taking their place in defining the development policy that they need .
In all , I believe this agreement represents a good balance between trade liberalisation and regulation , and also between trade and the development of all types of farming .
Many of you have , quite rightly , said as much , and we shall have to keep working on it in other forums .
We therefore have a little time to prepare for the peak in the negotiations which will no doubt occur at around that time .
There is a problem here .
We also need to think about the therapeutic technologies that we wish to give priority to .
A proper public health policy implies disease prevention .
So let us look at the situation regarding each of these three aspects .
The action plans adopted for partnership with third countries are looking more and more like a means of holding back immigration .
Surely we urgently need to guarantee better data protection and finally ensure that we have democratic and judicial scrutiny ?
This kind of report must be seen above all as providing food for thought on the added value of deepening the area of security , freedom and justice that is at the very heart of the Union , so that the Union can be prepared to meet the challenges of an external policy in this field .
On the contrary , only if Europe is equipped with instruments that are permanent , operational and coordinated to a similar degree can it exert its influence on the international scene and impose its vision of humanism and the protection of individual freedoms .
The first question raised touches on a matter of principle : the objective of protecting the citizens , laid down in the Amsterdam Treaty .
The third point that was emphasised concerns the delay in achieving the Tampere objectives .
The object here is not so much to achieve mutual recognition as to make sure the EU Member States combat acts that affect all the countries of the Union in a coordinated manner , in the same manner and by imposing penalties of equivalent severity .
Moreover , there is some risk that this situation could block the decision-making process ; even if this risk is overcome at the price of artificially separating acts that in fact have the same aim , this deadlock would make the Union ' s action unintelligible to the citizens .
I believe it is time to call a stop to this masquerade and this caricature of democratic debate .
We have two types of external action .
Looking to the future , I believe that there are some difficult areas in the context of cooperation with the United States ; we must not conceal that fact .
Having said that , I will certainly read the resolution the European Parliament is about to adopt very closely and reflect carefully on the implications of your recommendation .
Before the highly important vote we will soon be holding on relations between Europe and the United States , I would urgently ask for the exchange of letters between Mr Bush and Mr Prodi to be made available to all Members .
Given Africa ' s trade links , in which France has been pivotal for historic reasons , I fear that this change will represent a further blow for the European producers of Guadeloupe and Martinique .
Public services can be given a new lease of life through these new technologies , if the means are made available to them , and of course if they have the will to do so .
Although the situation in the Middle East is extremely serious , the European Union must not give in .
