We call for specific financial assistance to go directly to the people who live in frontier zones and who are more exposed geographically to the arrival of illegal immigrants .
How will it be spent ?
They are held in such inhumane and degrading conditions that the centre exploded into a true democratic emergency .
It is good of Commissioner Barrot to go to Lampedusa in the next few days and I appreciate this .

I therefore very much welcome the recovery plan decided on by the Commission , which has sought to use all the tools at its disposal , although we know that they are limited , and we understand the reasons why .
This would , I believe , make for a 'win-win' situation in terms of employment , innovation , competitiveness and the environment . on behalf of the ALDE Group . - ( IT ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the crisis in the motor industry has spread throughout the entire sector , to ancillary industries , other associated sectors , commercial networks and thus services , and has terrible prospects in terms of employment .
The United States are taking action , as are some European countries , and I hope that my country will move on from generic proposals to practical measures , but I hope for stronger European action both within and outside the recovery plan , because I believe , and have explained to the Commissioner at length , that the fate of the great European firms is our shared fate .
It is my belief that no worker , from the old to the temporary contractor , should be laid off .
Innovation cannot be achieved by getting rid of the workers .
I would like to thank my colleagues at the Committee on International Trade and , most of all , the shadow rapporteurs of the two largest groups , Mrs Saïfi and Mrs Locatelli , and offer my heartfelt thanks to the secretariat and to Dr Bendini in particular .
I agree with the political break that has been made , which respects the needs of Member States hoping to encourage consumers both within and outside the EU to view their agricultural produce above all in terms of its quality , nutritional characteristics , food safety and production methods .
The few SMEs that do export outside of the EU tend to focus on developed and basically saturated markets such as the United States , Canada and Switzerland ; it is rare for them to take their products to emerging countries .
I voted in favour of Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf 's report on the placing on the market and use of feed .
I am thus persuaded that the development of further agreements can only improve the economic position of both contracting parties .
And the name of one of the murderers is Cesare Battisti .
Indeed , for the sake of the friendship and respect that joins our countries , for the sake of the friendship and cooperation and partnership agreements linking Brazil and the European Union , whether politically or economically , the response of all parties must be decisive and effective .
Nobody can allow someone who has killed unarmed people and has used every possible means to evade justice and the victims ' relatives to assume the attitude of a victim of persecution and to create dangerous precedents to the detriment of the law and society . on behalf of the UEN Group . - ( IT ) Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , with this joint motion for a resolution , this Parliament will make its authoritative voice heard , at international level , for reconsideration of the extradition of Cesare Battisti and , above all , it will pay tribute to the memory of the victims and show its solidarity with their families who , for more than 20 years , have been waiting for their fundamental right to justice , denied for so long , to at last be fulfilled .
Nonetheless , I would like to point out that the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly will meet in the near future and demonstrate the role that parliaments have to play , even in this difficult situation .
They have all contributed to the drafting of this report , which I believe enjoys widespread support .
The Union for the Mediterranean , the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly and the common foreign policy in relation to the south are all excellent and legitimate tools that can be used to carve out a stronger , more significant and credible role for Europe .
Furthermore , I hope that the Union will play an ever-more effective role in the search for peace , in conflict resolution , in the strengthening of democracy , in the defence of religious freedom and in the fight against terrorism , drug trafficking , organised crime and people trafficking .
Because once we have a European Foreign Minister who will , in part , represent the Commission and the Council , I hope that this minister will not be a 28th foreign minister to add to all the others but , at least on the European side , the Member States will feel that they are represented by this person .
The second objective is to confirm that this is not a marginal sector or an exception ; rather it is firmly established in the market economy , with its own rules that the internal market must recognise and respect .
It can , I believe , help to sustain our social systems when times are hard .
The third objective is to decide what we can do in practice to support this sector .
Finally , some legislative initiatives are called for .
Before I finish ,
