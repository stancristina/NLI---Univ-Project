Commission propose ?
How can we resolve the problems of identifying the client ?
The second conclusion reached by the Commission is that it would be desirable to have a tax on national flights and on intra-Community flights , subject to modification of the bilateral agreements , which is something I do not agree with .
It is an inappropriate argument and it is not in accordance with European legislation , and furthermore it would do comparative harm to services provided by other means .
That disaster led to the pollution of 400 km of French coastline , with serious consequences for the environment , and for the citizens who lived and ran businesses in that area , whether they be oyster farmers , shellfish gatherers , fishermen or simply citizens involved in the tourist sector .
One year after the sinking of the Erika , we must all ask ourselves whether or not we have really been able to meet the expectations of Europe ' s citizens .
The Commission ' s proposal therefore has three fundamental objectives : firstly , to carry out better monitoring and inspection of the traffic of all the ships off our coasts .
Furthermore , they are unlikely to be compensated for 100 % of the damages they have suffered .
The European Maritime Safety Agency constitutes a first stage in the increasing integration of the administrative practices of the Member States , which may one day lead to the creation , as has been repeatedly requested by this House , of a genuine European coastguard organisation .
That seems to us to be essential .
Even the countries which have a lesser degree of safety with regard to their ships have some ships which are safe ; therefore , in accordance with international laws , we cannot exclude them a priori .
The main difficulty stems from the amendment of Article 6 of that directive ; the Commission and the European Parliament propose the introduction of financial compensation to cover the possible responsibilities of classification societies in cases of maritime accidents .
That does not consider who is liable or not , simply how much should be paid ; but there is a maximum ceiling , as you well know , of USD 180 million , some EUR 200 million , which , as I have said , is inadequate .
With regard to European coastguards , I believe that in order to facilitate the creation of an agency we can at least begin to better coordinate the action of the various bodies which act in the various European Union waters and which are different in each country .
The WTO will condemn - it must condemn - the unfair competition on the part of Korea .
I feel particularly obliged to mention the problem of Spain .
The Commission proposal , in point 1 of Annex 1 , intends to systematically add on five decibels for all noise created between 7.00 p.m. and 11.00 p.m.
It would be the Member States who would determine the length of that period , according to their own customs .
The multiannual plan has ambitious objectives and a very broad scope , which can be extended to the candidate countries .
And lastly , that public health and the environment must be given priority over all other considerations , particularly financial considerations .
Our organisation includes teachers and workers , public employees and private individuals , religious and lay people , trade unionists , businesspeople , militant pacifists , artists , people working in the media , very well-known individuals and many who are completely unknown .
Our tragic situation is unusual in this democratic Europe .
Non-nationalist elected officials are murdered , as well as businesspeople , journalists , members of the security forces or private individuals who have expressed themselves in any way against the project to impose independence .
It is a palpable fear which invades people ' s daily lives and makes them speak in whispers or hide what they really think , just as people did during the worst periods of the Franco dictatorship .
This is something that one of the first thinkers of a united Europe , Erasmus of Rotterdam , warned against centuries ago , when he said in one of his adages : " If any title is considered a suitable reason to start a war , then anybody - amid so many vicissitudes in human affairs , so many changes - can hold such a title .
That is what Erasmus said .
( Loud and sustained applause )
On the other hand , I hope that the Intergovernmental Conference announced for 2004 , which seems to me to be the only positive outcome of Nice , will deal once and for all with the distribution of competences between the European Union and the governments of the Member States .
This Fund was created for very real and substantial policies , investments in roads , investments in direct infrastructures , and it must now be brought up to date with the new economic situation and the new competitive circumstances .
I have nothing against the regional authorities , which will channel the proposals and will take the decisions on the funding of the new programmes , but I believe that this a step backwards which destroys some of the freshness of the proposals born of the local bodies ' intimate knowledge of the real difficulties .
In any event , it seems to me , Mr President , that if we cut off subsidies and if the unfair Korean competition continues , the European shipbuilding industry will be fatally wounded .
In recent weeks , the Commission has told us that the system of subsidies , thanks to which our industry is subsisting , must be removed as from January as a result of a supposed improvement in competitiveness .
