abstain .
These proposals have kept the debate alive , including with the European Parliament , and particularly the work of the task force presided over by the President of the European Council .
We stabilise , we consolidate and we modernise .
The current treaty gives us plenty of scope to do this and I am convinced that the Community method will once again give us the right answer .
This means also that sanctions must be designed so as to apply to all Member States on an equal basis .
A comprehensive scoreboard of indicators will give us what we need to identify increasing divergences and to propose remedies .
This is not just an addition of different strategies .
Will it be the Member States , the Council or the Community institutions - that is , the European Central Bank and the European Commission ?
We already needed to do this a year ago , as the Americans did , because it is the only way of reopening the supply of credit in the private sector .
For this reason , Parliament accepted that it has to take a rather complicated step , but one which we can explain to the citizens and which involves giving the Belgian Presidency a chance without sacrificing anything fundamental .
I believe that , when we ask for employed people to make adjustments which are as important as they are now , saying that the Member States cannot envisage the transfer of some authorities to a single city is a massive joke to our fellow citizens .
We will come back to this , as I will have the opportunity of returning , as you know , in the next few weeks or months , to a series of proposals which were put together in an agenda approved by the Commission on 2 June , which the Council of Finance Ministers supported , and which the European Council adopted .
I am thinking of the reinforcement of the joint committee , as advocated by Mr Skinner .
We will bring forward many of the tools that Mrs Ferreira herself proposed , and we will translate these proposals into legislative proposals .
If they are toxic , why authorise them ?
I would like to say finally , Madam President , that I will be very careful to see that we get it right on Solvency II , and also on everything that affects the implementation of Basel .
I am open to this idea , which would mean that the supervisory authorities grouped together in the new European network must be proactive in the supervision of products , particularly the most harmful ones , which may pose a risk to financial stability and the protection of consumers that I have just mentioned .
We have tried , in the Commission proposal , to stay as close as possible and even sometimes to go a bit further than the ambition of the de Larosi√®re report on this European architecture .
On some points , the Americans have achieved somewhat more , but we will also take action on one extremely important point , namely the regulation of derivatives and short selling , this coming September .
Nothing forced us to do that , other than the desire , which you have yourself shown , to seek a compromise , to have a discussion with each other .
Madam President , as you have understood , I will be answering on behalf of my colleague Olli Rehn , who , incidentally , may have used a bit more of my time on the final response .
The European stabilisation mechanism and the European Financial Stability Facility will have no direct impacts on the borrowing and financing activities of the EIB .
Article 122( 2 ) of the treaty has been used as the legal basis of the rules for this financial stabilisation mechanism , because the Commission and the Council have acted in emergencies in which a number of Member States were seriously threatened by grave difficulties caused by exceptional events outside their control .
These ideas will also be turned into legislative proposals at the end of 2010 and the start of 2011 .
This is a market of 500 million citizens in which small businesses , of which there are very many , citizens and consumers are not doing well .
It is a text which not only transposes at European level the principles of the Financial Stability Board , which we agreed at the G20 in Pittsburgh , in September 2009 , but which also goes beyond this by setting clear and stringent limits on variable remuneration , while allowing credit establishments and investment companies a margin of flexibility .
I also intend to undertake a study next year on corporate governance beyond the financial sector , in particular , concerning the role of shareholders , diversity , and the role of women , for example , in the composition of corporate boards of directors .
It is a directive which arguably contains the most ambitious rules in the world on remuneration factors .
Clear rules have been implemented which cannot be interpreted in different ways .
Mr Christensen , you stressed the need for transparency .
The obligations contained in the regulation must target those operators who place timber on the market for the first time , because that is when there is the most risk .
Ladies and gentlemen , our action , Mr President , is intended to be part of this ambition , an ambition that you certainly share .
So , let us set about opening a dialogue together , continuing the dialogue , but , above all , adopting a text that we have been waiting for for so long .
The Belgian Presidency will support the flagship initiatives announced by the Commission .
On the other hand , we have been less successful in information technology
