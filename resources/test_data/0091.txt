In my opinion , the report also goes too far in its recognition of the rights of so-called third parties to restrict the availability of documents .
The list of exceptions , as Mrs Maij-Weggen said , is essential , and perhaps the most important part of this work .
Mr President , the right of Members of Parliament to confidential documents is a very important issue , but it cannot replace the direct right of access to information on the part of the public .
Mr President , I would like to thank Mr Cashman for his excellent work .
Transparency and democracy are important values in our work , and they will come about if registers on existing information , including that deemed confidential , are made obligatory .
This is the principle which I have made the starting point in my own report on the accessibility to information on the environment .
I would like to focus attention on something which concerns public accessibility to documents which fall within the authority of the Commission or are in the possession of bodies set up by the institutions .
I do not think Mr Cashman' s chosen technique here is a good one , however .
Secondly , I would like to draw attention to the work on derogations .
But it is just as important to temper public opinion , which borders very much on the paranoid as a result of exaggerated secrecy with regard to documents on such matters as security and defence .
In fact , it is important , as far as security is concerned , that the public can judge , using facts and documents , just how much confidence they have in European defence .
Mr President , we are now in a situation in which we can really say that steps are being taken in the direction we have wanted for many years , and the principles of which were agreed in the Treaty of Amsterdam .
Bureaucracy has also to be avoided here .
At this stage we would also then have the chance to examine , on political grounds , whether the suppression of documents has been judged entirely appropriately .
It is the European Commission ' s aim to double the share of renewable energy sources in the total consumption of energy by the year 2010 .
Renewables are a very important part of an effective climate protection strategy .
Unlike in Central Europe , there is a lot of peat in the Nordic countries such as Finland .
Peat is an important fuel particularly in these regions , where it also has an important impact on employment .
The importance of nuclear energy is increasing constantly , for this very reason .
I hope our government and parliament will take a positive view of this request .
The responsible use of nuclear energy provides the opportunity for an energy source that is environmentally friendly and economical , and there is no reason to place restrictions on its use .
Mr President , my colleague , Mr von Wogau , and I would seem to share something more than just the same opinion today .
When a bank suffers losses , its own resources function as a buffer , which helps to cover the losses that ordinary business profits cannot cover sufficiently .
With modern techniques in risk management it is possible to gain much more precise data on risks than previously .
So it is natural that the banks should also be given the opportunity to use these resources and create a more risk-sensitive working environment .
In fact , I believe that internal classification will , in future , enjoy a more important status , as often it is within the banks themselves that key personnel from companies to be allowed credit are well known , as are the companies ' operations generally .
Our rapporteur , Mrs Villiers , who has been responsible for some excellent work , mentioned in her report the possibility of applying a fast track method .

The Ombudsman looks after the public interest in the direction of the administration .
The Ombudsman , Jacob Söderman , works , by virtue of his job description , for the people and in order for good administration to take root in the Union .
It is , however , vitally important to adopt good , open and effective administrative practice , so that the European Union will gain the support and confidence of its citizens more satisfactorily than it does at present .
The rapporteur , Herbert Bösch , from the Committee on Petitions , states in the explanatory statement in his report that the principles that led to the Ombudsman' s recommendations proved to be the same as those adhered to by the European Parliament : correctness , transparency and the desire to create confidence .
Its job is legislation and to monitor the Union ' s bureaucratic machine on behalf of the public .
The most important of Mr Söderman' s proposals is the right of applicants to have access to their corrected examination papers afterwards .
The Committee says that the Commission has informed the Ombudsman it was implementing this recommendation as from the start of July 2000 .
My colleague , Mr Bösch , has already briefly presented here the amendments to the report he tabled .
Mr President , first of all I would like to send my best regards to Commissioner Viviane Reding and thank her for the initiative she has shown in the field of sport .
This is the direction it has been going in since Amsterdam .
Sport has many important social , cultural and , besides , very significant economic dimensions .
It is a very positive sign that the Union ' s sports ministers would like a statement made at the Nice Summit that would act as an
