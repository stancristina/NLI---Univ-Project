their clear and unambiguous rejection of attempts by Great Britain and Spain to decide the fate of Gibraltar without listening to the people .
I hope that account will also be taken of the fact that some of us in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left have asked a number of victims of this terrorist legislation in the European Union to come here to the European Parliament on Wednesday , both for a press conference and a round-table conference .
I think it is downright disgraceful , given that these are in actual fact people who are not in a position to defend themselves .
At the committee reading , a number of proposals went through which further strengthened the programme 's common dimension .
They must not be shunted like mere objects between the various Member States , as unfortunately often happens at present .
Events in recent years indicate very clearly the need for common programmes and common funding within the sphere of asylum .
Unfortunately - and this , I think , is something that deserves to be pointed out - the EU 's refugee and asylum policy has in recent years been characterised mostly by directly opposite tendencies .
The latter certainly constitutes the mainstay of asylum and refugee policy , but it makes sense to adapt one 's practice to changes in the real state of affairs .
Mass graves are being found today and the remains of corpses identified .
What was lacking was a common approach .
However , we wish to make the rules more predictable and to increase the consideration given to the wishes of the individual .
These are people we are dealing with !
It must be possible for asylum seekers who have family members in a particular Member State to have their applications examined in that country .
It is our view that partners and cohabitees , irrespective of gender , should be counted as family members in Member States which treat unmarried and married couples equally .
In my view , the type of abuses that go on at Sangatte near the Channel Tunnel , with people shunted about and responsibility divided between different Member States , should be rendered impossible by the proposal you have produced .
Mr President , it is very easy to feel powerless faced with the asylum situation we have in Europe .
It is easy to feel powerless faced with the fact that so many people need this protection , but also faced with the inability we have in many quarters to integrate asylum seekers and immigrants into our Member States .
I want to emphasise what Mr Marinho said about how important it is for the Member States to take this issue seriously now and to exchange words for action .
It is therefore gratifying that the EU can now go a step further than the Dublin Convention did .
An important contribution to this is the extended concept of the family which we now have the opportunity to take a decision on .
The most serious objection is to Amendments Nos 19 and 27 , which the Commission too is unable to accept .
Not even the environment can justify carelessness in deciding what is or is not criminal behaviour .
We believe there is a need to create a common penal platform when it comes to the fight against environmental crime , and we are sympathetic to framework decisions in this area .
When it came to Mr Marinho 's report on rules for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application , we Swedish Social Democrats voted against Amendment No 13 and abstained from voting where Amendments Nos 14 , 15 and 24 were concerned .
Such a system would also militate against harmonisation of the ways in which refugees are received .
In applying the definition of family members , it is important however that the principle of subsidiarity should prevail .
- ( SV ) We have voted in favour of the report on checks at the common borders but have certain reservations concerning Amendment No 4 through which the police would , in certain circumstances , be given the ability to carry out identity checks and provisionally arrest people in the territory of another Member State .
We also wish to highlight Amendment No 1 , which would give the police from another Member State the right to continue surveillance if the receiving Member State were not in a position to do the same .
Giving foreign police the right to take over surveillance or make arrests in another Member State obviously means that the work concerned can be done more efficiently .
There must also be guarantees that all the requirements of the Schengen Convention are observed in their entirety before foreign police take action in another Member State .
As you hear , Mr Solana and Mr Patten , we all feel incredibly powerless , disgusted and frustrated .
The European Parliament has condemned the terrorist attacks on countless occasions and urged Arafat and the Palestinian Authority to do everything in their power to stop them and to counter the hatred now also being spread to the Israelis .
A whole world is now united in demanding that Israel withdraw from the Palestinian areas .
Now , reports are flooding in that these are being violated .
It seems as if the parties can no longer escape from the situation .
At the meeting on Monday , the ministers must ask themselves what we can do .
I do not believe that , in the present situation , this would be the right moment to suspend it , but the matter must be discussed .
Mr President , the other day , the Financial Times observed that the EU 's Middle East policy lies in ruins , and Le Monde complains about the EU 's impotence in the Middle East
