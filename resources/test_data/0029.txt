The 'market ' is put forward as a solution to the lack of a genuine policy aimed at overcoming energy dependency on fossil fuels and excessive energy consumption .
Most importantly , the production of biomass and biofuels should not replace the main function of agriculture , which is food production .
However , we cannot accept the following points , for example : because 'local authorities in developing countries are not always in a position to provide the volumes of financing required to make major investments in the construction and maintenance of infrastructure networks , for example to supply water or provide sanitation' , the report concludes that the solution is 'only supplementary injections of private capital , through public-private partnerships , will be able to provide the requisite volume of funding ' , thus handing this fundamental resource for life on a plate to private capital ; and making the reduction - rather than the cancellation - of the debts of the least-developed countries contingent on what is termed 'good governance ' , the criteria for which are dictated by the whims of the major powers .
After all , 27 % of men and 38 % of women in Europe are overweight .
Obesity is the most common form of malnutrition and arises from an excessive storage of fat .
An inquiry into the effects of the existence of differing limitation periods and in particular into the number of personal injury cases involving citizens in cross-border areas and differing limitation periods may help us understand the situation .
As the rapporteur says , although there has for a long time been evidence to show that young women and girls are no less capable than men and boys when it comes to education , there is a series of factors that continues to place them at a disadvantage , especially in higher education and lifelong learning .
In view of the fact that some EU Member States have a historical relationship and continued links with this region , either in political or in cultural and economic terms , the EU as a whole should strengthen these ties for the mutual benefit of both the countries in the region and EU Member States .
Our view is indeed shared by most businesses and Member States in stating that they do not apply this Directive .
We do not want this process to lead to the repeal of any legislation that undermines the notion that competition and the profits of business are of prime importance , above all other considerations .
Consequently , at the forthcoming negotiation stage , all our attention must be focused on the process , in order to monitor the development of the definitions and the content thereof .
One must , on the other hand , be mindful of the fact that , for all our good intentions on reducing pollution , the truth is that the ongoing increase in standards of living in the EU , and indeed throughout the world , will always lead to higher consumption and inevitably to more waste .
Let us not forget , however , that given the enormous amount of waste currently produced , measures aimed at reuse , recycling and disposal that could be implemented remain inadequate and incapable of meeting our needs .
I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Bozkurt because it reinforces the idea that the Turkish Government must adopt measures enabling women to play a more prominent role in Turkey 's social , economic and political life , despite progress that has already been made .

Drift nets have a major impact on fisheries resources and on marine ecosystems , and an economic impact - in terms of competition and loss of income - on fishermen using more traditional gear .

Parliament has already rejected the Commission 's proposal for voluntary modulation of direct payments under the CAP of up to 20 % .
It is therefore vital that the Member States attach maximum priority to realising these projects and do not shy away from adopting all the measures needed to complete them .
It is a document that asserts , or confirms , our undertakings as regards reducing emissions and promoting alternative energies .
In any event , we shall carefully monitor the implementation of some of the ideas in the report , whilst fighting to ensure that they are not exploited for the purpose of further concentrating energy in the hands of the wealthiest countries or in such a way that it is the consumer who has to carry the can for the pollution costs of the polluting companies .
