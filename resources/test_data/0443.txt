They have tried to concentrate on exports and rein in domestic demand .
If an individual country , Sweden say , did so , it would mean only that capital would stream out of the country .
This policy must now be offset by a policy on employment which assumes the same weight and the same importance .
In the long term there is no such conflict : low inflation , low budget deficits and low interest rates are in the long term good for employment .
We must have greater coordination of macro-economic and labour market policies .
Parties are created and given life by the people .
Secondly , in current circumstances , such a move would be a step backwards for democratic development .
It would lead to the creation of a superbody , above the free national parties and such a shift of power away from its popular base must be resisted .
I think that Mr Herzog has made a good attempt to structure the problem of the democratic deficit and the lack of openness and transparency .
I am directly opposed to the points in the proposal concerned with improving the supply of information on European integration by means of conventions between the media , the Community , and Member States : the media must remain totally without ties , conventions and agreements , otherwise they will lose their integrity .
Mr President , enlargement gives us a unique opportunity to unite Europe .
The EU itself must also change its current form .
The report from Christodoulou is just one stage in a wider debate and it raises the financial questions for discussion .
If there is no change , this proportion will increase greatly in an enlarged EU.
In my opinion , both are fundamentally positive but they highlight a number of problems which must be taken into account .
We have every reason to continue to aim at the goals set by the CAP , that is to adjust agricultural prices gradually , and I mean gradually , towards the world market price .
In my opinion , Europe has everything to gain from such a logical continuation of the CAP.
In respect of this , I believe that the effect of enlargement on the budget is being exaggerated .
It is also quite clear that , with large differences in GNP between the EU countries and these new countries , care must be taken when transferring structural programmes to them .
I think that the proposal to review set aside compensation and other fixed compensation under the CAP is a good idea .
I think that European agriculture , after enlargement , can look forward to the future with great confidence .
We are talking about genuine cooperation between the Commission , Parliament and the Member States .
There is a survey of the situation concerning temporary residence permits in all fifteen Member States in the working document which I presented to the Council of Ministers .
I base my opinion on the proposal document for the regulations governing implementation of Article 10( 1 ) of the Europol Convention .
There is to be no transparency on this .
If the honourable Member is mistakenly entered into the register he can appeal to the national supervisory authority which will be established to ensure that Europol uses its database as intended .
We are completely in agreement with that .
This already takes place between Swedish and Danish police .
I have a question which takes us a little further forward and I am certain I will not get an answer to it .
Of course this is a national responsibility but there is also a joint responsibility and interest in this issue and I believe that we should agree on it .
The answer from Commissioner Flynn is the clearest we have received so far and we will try to pass it on to those at home in Sweden who find themselves in this situation .
Right from the very first discussions on the 31 May , the liberal group have raised the importance of thorough preparation and legislation to facilitate the orderly functioning of this new larger market .
They must be independent of all organisations and companies which provide telecommunications networks , equipment and services .
The Commission and the advisory committee must carefully monitor and report on developments to the national regulatory bodies and to the players in the market .
Information is not just a matter of technology - it is equally a question of democracy and of giving all groups equal opportunities .
The information society gives unparalleled opportunities for people to fulfil their deepest needs and wishes to be able to talk to , express oneself to and communicate with other people and with the surrounding world .
Prime responsibility for achieving this goal must rest with the Member States but this is to be in conjunction with EU bodies , European organisations , companies and international organisations .
Consultation and cooperation goes a long way in this respect and is , as I see it , a better way forward .
If funding is required to cover the cost of the provision of society wide services then this should be determined and administered at national level .
The proposal means more joint policing , immigration policy and border controls .
There has been no progress with regard to the rights of Member States to keep or introduce stricter environmental requirements for products .
With regard to employment , the proposed committee and its recommendations will have very little weight against the iron wall of convergence policies which are currently raising the levels of unemployment in the European Union .
International crime has a turnover of billions .
Now that crime has stepped into the international arena and knows no frontiers , politics must take the same step .
This deserves
