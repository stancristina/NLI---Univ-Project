Between 1990 and 1995 , over 56 million hectares of forest , distributed unevenly in various parts of the world , were lost but , without a doubt , this particularly affected developing countries as a result of the increased amount of land used for agricultural purposes , the construction of infrastructures , or due to natural disasters and fires .
Based on this budgetary agreement , which includes an agreement on dates , the differences have focused on aspects of comitology derived from the historic positions of Parliament and the Council itself that , with a view to the future , in my opinion - and not to insist on the problems made manifest in Mr Wijkman 's intervention - I believe that they should be revised in an interinstitutional agreement in order to speed up the parliamentary legislative procedure and make it more efficient .
However , what cannot happen is a battle leading to a distortion in competition between the different ports , where we find ourselves with a series of theoretically environmental measures on the protection of the coast or the sea , leading to a distortion in competition between the different ports .
In this respect , I would like to congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Bouwman , and the whole of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism for their painstaking work throughout the discussion and throughout the negotiation of this initiative .
And this is where the problem lies .
Apart from this , I would like to state that we consider the suggestions being made to be very positive and that , therefore , we could incorporate into the text of the directive , with some rewording that would enable coherence with current Community and international texts to be guaranteed , as well as coherence with the rest of the directive , amendments such as 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 and 15 .
I would like to reiterate my appreciation to the rapporteur and the rest of the Committee .
These inspections may be carried out by the roadside , in ports and in other places where vehicles park , or , as is more frequent in the case of public service vehicles , on the operator 's premises .
To this end , I hope that we can deal with these matters at the next Transport Council at the end of this month , as well as , as Mr Watts has said , all aspects of road safety in general since the Portuguese Presidency proposes this as one of the key matters of its Presidency .
Mr President , in the last plenary part-session , regarding the Gallagher report on the recommendations of the ICCAT on bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean , we had the opportunity to debate this issue of Commission delays , which are becoming a very serious problem .
To this end , I hope that the Commission will bear in mind the points of view being expressed in the European Parliament .
From there on , the Commission must begin to work , and must fulfil its obligations in accordance with the Treaty .
From the point of view of this Parliament , this type of arrangement cannot be allowed .
We understand that the Commission has to be reformed .
This is not the first attempt to turn the Commission into a world-class public service , but we , Mr Prodi , wish to believe in the sincerity and resolve of your promise to this House .
Now that we are establishing new measures , how do we know they will be used ?
Go for it , Mr Prodi .
We are dealing with the content involving civil and political rights , and then we will deal with citizenship rights and economic and social rights .
Being European has an added positive effect .
We want the Charter to be incorporated into the Treaties precisely because we want the citizens to have more rights and guarantees .
I believe that , by affirming the indivisibility of fundamental rights , as this resolution does , or affirming their innovative nature , we are taking positive steps towards an improvement in the living conditions of the European citizens .
There is no doubt that the Kingdom of Morocco is currently occupying the Western Sahara and this territory is currently undergoing a process of self-determination .
Yes or no , Commissioner ?
As on other occasions , such as the Intergovernmental Conference of 1996 , this Parliament must offer the Commission its support in order to monitor information activities .
The Commissioner is , at times , the master of side-stepping the question , with all the skill of a bullfighter , and failing to provide an answer .
In fact , these two extremes of the Pyrenees are suffering from saturation since they are the only real land links of any capacity between the Iberian Peninsula and the rest of the European continent .
However , as you well know , we clearly have problems with one of the countries involved with regard to the railway between Oloron and Canfranc .
In other cases , such as the specific case we are talking about , we must put the infrastructures in order , but of course we are prepared to speak to the Member States - and we are doing so - to see if we can persuade the two countries involved to finally accept a project of this type which will allow for a central crossing in the Pyrenees .
The communication on sensitive areas basically tackles the issue of how to combine two elements : the environmental demands of the Pyrenees and the Alps and the need to facilitate the movement of goods and people .
Given the principle of subsidiarity , we do not consider it
