hemp which is used to produce hashish .
I should ideally have liked to see aid reduced immediately to the aid level for cereals , but I can happily live with the Commission ' s proposal .
It gives farmers time to adapt .
I cannot , however , live with the recommendation from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
That would be "far out " of place !
Where flax is concerned , the Commission also proposes to limit the opportunity for subsidy-hunting and , here too , the Committee is in favour of improving the scheme .
It should be the market and consumers who decide what should be produced , not sky-high EU subsidies .
Mr President , Mr Bösch 's report deals clearly and relevantly with the problems bound up with protecting the EU' s financial interests and combating fraud .
I do not know how large a percentage of the Member States ' budgets disappears due to fraud and irregularities .
Mr Bösch 's report goes a very long way towards representing the positions adopted by my group , most especially in its observations concerning the European Investment Bank and the European Central Bank .
We have a problem in relation to appointing a European Public Prosecutor , whose office we would regard as an integral part of the federal EU we do not wish to see .
We think that the problems highlighted can be solved at national level .
We think , however , that this ought to be an incentive to engage in negotiations designed to promote cooperation between the legal systems .
We agree with the way in which the problems are described , but I do not believe that crime and theft are combated by establishing a common public prosecution service and common penalties and by appointing more inspectors within the EU.
If it can always be seen who has obtained what , fraud will be revealed by journalists and a critical public - perfectly free of charge and with far greater preventative effect .
What are we not allowed to see ?
When will we be given a complete overview of all the committees and working parties , together with their members ?
Will our rapporteurs be allowed to check on any payment from the funds ?
Lack of transparency is the fraudsters ' best friend and makes it more difficult to clarify matters .
The very fact that my Italian colleague is opposed to it means that it really is a report of very high quality .
Reform of the Commission is now under way .
I am very impressed with the reform plan .
There are nonetheless a number of sticking points , and these are what we ought to draw attention to and criticise .
This would deal with disciplinary matters and help recover money which has been paid out unlawfully .
This idea is one we should stick to , I think .
If such a body were to be established , this would mean that disciplinary matters would be taken away from the Commission .
At present , officials who have had actions brought against them by the disciplinary council have colleagues of theirs sitting in judgement over them .
Both the ECHO and MED cases are all too well-known examples of this state of affairs .
We have , of course , established OLAF to deal with suspicions of fraud and irregularities .
I cannot , however , vote in favour of setting up a European Public Prosecutor ' s office .
It would , however , be a colossal enterprise to set up when the problems are , in reality , elsewhere .
It is , for all that , only the most serious cases which will have penal consequences .
Ninety per cent of cases will be disciplinary matters concerning negligence or incompetence .
Instead , there is a need for public , internal supervision and for more leeway when it comes to sacking people .
I would also point out that I had three minutes in which to speak .
I am happy to let someone else use my time .
It is indispensable to undertake a radical review of this aid , especially when enlargement to include the Eastern European countries is to become a reality .
It is problematic , however , that there is not the courage to engage in a full and candid discussion of how our agricultural sector is , in the longer term , to cope under quite different conditions and with a quite different aid scheme than that which is in place at present .
On the other hand , the reduction in agricultural aid should be gradual and carried out at such a pace that there is no risk of EU aid being replaced by national schemes designed to compensate for its disappearance .
It would also be problematic if the Commission were to withdraw aid from agriculture with a view to using the resources for another purpose .
Aid should not be reduced for the wrong reasons .
Even though there was a slight decline in fraud and irregularities between 1997 and 1998 , there is still a great need for more effective supervisory mechanisms .
There are , however , a few sticking points .
If such a body were to be established , this would mean that disciplinary procedures would be taken away from the Commission .
At present , officials who have had actions brought against them by the disciplinary council have colleagues of theirs sitting in judgement over them .
Both the ECHO and MED cases are all too well-known examples of this state of affairs .
We ought likewise to criticise the proposal in the white paper to the effect that an advisory panel should be set up to deal with irregularities .
We have established OLAF to deal with suspicions of fraud and irregularities
