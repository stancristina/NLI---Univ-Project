As Mr Michel said last week : we know where we start but we do not know where we finish .
It might even be impossible .
How can the EU respond ?
The essence of the non-paper is the mediation and arrangement of an initial meeting between the Israeli Foreign Minister , Mr Peres , and Mr Arafat .
The current enlargement process is in itself nothing new for the Union .
However , it is unparalleled in its magnitude , the variety of candidate countries and its political and historical dimension .
We could have easily rejected the compromise reached in Nice , but we opted not to do that so as not to send out the wrong message , namely that of an indecisive and reticent Europe , at the wrong time , that is to say on the eve of the reunification of Europe .
Enlargement was , and still is , imperative in order to prevent destabilisation in the candidate countries , as well as the expressions of such destabilisation .
Enlargement , even if it is still to be translated into reality , is already making Europe more prosperous and enhancing its influence .
So , what stage have the negotiations reached ?
By this , I mean that the number of chapters which have already been negotiated , and for which provisional agreements have been reached , is such that the question now becoming increasingly specific and , therefore , increasingly urgent concerns the differentiation in treatment of candidate countries , each according to its merits , as well as the question of knowing how the negotiations will end .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , the enlargement process cannot , however , be reduced simply to the conclusion of negotiating points .
I am thinking , for example , of the beginning of the election campaign in Poland , or of the new Bulgarian government that has come into power .
That is very true , but even so , the candidate countries have every interest in ensuring that the acquis communautaire is implemented in the optimal fashion , because otherwise there is a risk that the initial stage of their membership of the European Union will be very difficult and very painful .
I am always reminded of that prime minister of a candidate country who stated in Brussels recently : ' We have been told for ten years that we will be joining in ten years ' time .
The Union must acquire the resources in order to deal with a destabilising crisis on the borders of an enlarged Europe - the Europe of tomorrow , in other words .
The concerns of the citizens of the Member States , but also of the citizens of the candidate countries , must be taken seriously and must be responded to appropriately .
We can now start counting the months , rather than the years .
- ( NL ) Society cannot survive without businesses which produce goods and provide services .
- ( NL ) No business can operate without the people who do the work .
Blokland report ( A5-0267/2001 )
Slovakia is one of the smaller candidate countries and can therefore afford a higher degree of flexibility .
These observations will hopefully speak for themselves as it is impossible to list them all here .
The matter should , in our opinion , be subject to a thorough investigation , particularly to establish whether this was simply one incident or whether this was a symptom of a more systematic phenomenon .
That is why the coalition has come under pressure .
We continue to receive complaints about the treatment of minorities , and not only from Budapest .
That is why we are devoting a great deal of attention to the establishment of democratic institutions in the candidate countries , something in which the Council of Europe too , with its own expertise , is involved in an extremely constructive manner .
However , the concern for the integrity of civil servants , judges , police and administrators is often in stark contrast to the paltry salaries they receive , and I believe that this too should remain an area of attention during the accession process .
If the Cypriot Government continues to do what it can in order to restore unity , the division will not be so much of an obstacle to the Government as it will be in the negotiations with Turkey .
And I hope that Turkey takes proper note of this .
As for the treatment of other minorities , what is written so neatly on paper and in laws appears , once again , not to bear any resemblance to reality .
This is borne out by recent opinion polls .
Whatever the case , the incentive in the resolution is mainly aimed at the Member States .
As long as the candidate countries cannot co-determine far-reaching cooperation in various areas of policy - such as the CFSP and the asylum , immigration and monetary policies - the European Union may not impose new criteria in these areas .
Let us not forget that most accession countries are also countries of origin and transit of trafficking in women .
The issues that are around in our countries are a fear of immigrants , anxiety about loss of jobs and concerns surrounding the relocation of businesses .
As a consequence , a whole generation of people will not be able to benefit from either system .
Other speakers have already made that point , for example as regards the impact on the powers and role of the European Parliament of a greater use of " soft law " instruments .
The differences of opinion in the board of Commissioners have obviously actually led to regional involvement on the final decision-making being scrapped .
I know that the present
