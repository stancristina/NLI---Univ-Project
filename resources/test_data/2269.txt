It must be clear , however , that this distinction can only apply during a transitional period .
Finally , institutions must learn from each other instead of constantly reinventing the wheel .
We have therefore asked the Commission to give us an undertaking that during the transitional period which is about to begin the system of centralised ex ante control will be maintained and will not be affected by the introduction of the internal audit function .
In its 1997 opinion it wrote : " As for completely abolishing the requirement of prior approval , this would not be acceptable unless it were to be replaced by other procedures that provided at least equivalent safeguards and that could also involve financial officials other than the financial controller . "
However , I can understand the pragmatic reasoning behind this idea .
In summary , independent audits are compulsory but cannot be carried out without modern and efficient ex ante control .
I also believe that , as far as this is concerned , we need the advice from the European Court of Auditors .
If we lay something down for large institutions , the neutrality principle proposed by the Committee of Independent Experts should then apply across the board .
I lament the fact that , as a consequence , young people are prevented from gaining experience - study , work or other experience - in another Member State .
Some outstanding payments date back as far as 1996 .
To put it mildly , it is in a conceptual and political vacuum .
Does this definition of the goal or problem still apply ?
Mr President , Mrs PÃ©ry , Commissioner , the position of , and relationship between , men and women in society has changed dramatically over the past decades .
To respect and value these differences shows that we still have our feet firmly on the ground .
The idea that women lag behind in paid work compared to men should certainly not be considered as inequality , because it is based on a one-sided , woman-unfriendly vision .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , although it is true that the text is flawed , as the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the rapporteur have already underlined , I would still venture to suggest that this legislative resolution is an example of transparent , simplified and efficient Community legislation .
I welcome the major overtures which have been made with regard to this dossier , which has been the subject of long and intense discussions within the Council .
But it can at the same time validate the result achieved and keep some points of its proposal in reserve , which can then be brought up for discussion again at the appropriate time .
The financial reform , more specifically the establishment of an internal audit department , is conducive to the European Union ' s effectiveness .
In my view , if the opportunity presents itself to step up efficiency within the EU institutions , each day that passes while we are waiting is one too many .
It is a different matter if such a small step forward puts a spanner in the works when it comes to reaching real solutions .
I believe that the choice today is not between complete freedom in the arms trade and this code of conduct .
Mr President , we all know by now that we should not entertain any illusions with regard to the nature of the present regime in Kabul .
Despite this - at least in western eyes - inhumane policy , the Taliban is seeking international diplomatic recognition .
That is a development which , in my view , deserves unqualified support from the European Union .
It appears to me that cooperation between Slavonic Macedonians and especially Albanian-speaking Macedonians is an extremely important topic which could manifest itself in the fight over the important initiative to establish a university in Tetovo .
I have to say that I still believe this to be a great bonus and it also proves that the state respects the country ' s own particular educational sphere .
I am pleased that the Greek government has now nullified this exemption .
Madam President , my contribution today is not based on all kinds of theoretical analyses but on my own experiences over the past week , because I happened to be in Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip when the disturbances took place .
In fact , I have quite a few observations regarding that visit .
Madam President , the peace process in the Middle East is extremely fragile .
I call on this Parliament to follow the Biblical line : pray for peace in Jerusalem so that the Jews and Arabs can live together in peace .
I would also like to say - and this is more of an appeal to the Council , but I am sharing it with the Commission and Parliament for now - let us not just make fine declarations with regard to the aid which we will soon be willing to grant to Serbia , but let us also make room for this cause in our own budget , the European Union ' s budget , so that we do not end up concluding that we can only help Serbia by taking funding away from other projects in the Balkans which need our support .
However , a sense of relief should not be attended by reckless carelessness .
In this context , I deplore the fact that the Dutch Minister for Foreign Affairs , fortunately abandoned by almost all parties in the Lower Chamber , adopted a stance out of the blue which goes against the unity of the European Union and against the wishes of the opposition in Serbia .
The neighbouring countries will take a great interest in this
