not only on the citizens but also with regard to the important objectives we have raised with the new treaty .
Who should decide in each individual case ?
Finally , the Treaty of Amsterdam has started down a road , taken a few short steps in the right direction , but the road is a long one , too long !
( Parliament adopted the decision )
And in recent times there has been a constant loss of ground in the battle against unemployment .
You cannot fail to approve their report and the treaty : every small step forward , however small , is always progress and deserves appreciation .
Monetary union implies the absorption into the Community of decidedly consistent shares of national sovereignty that cannot be handled with efficiency , fairness , transparency and participation : and this we cannot pretend to ignore .
The deepening of the substantial dimension of Union citizenship is basically the most important institutional contribution this treaty could give and has given , as all other aspects have been brought to a compulsory standstill .
At the same time an atmosphere of intimidation and fear has been created and continuously fuelled as a result of threatening statements by some congressmen .
The Committee , for example , noted with satisfaction how the Executive Commission intends to speed up investigations into the infringement of Community regulations and it is hoped that what has unfortunately happened several times in the past will not happen again , that is that reports have been dealt with after a long delay , or have not even received a reply .
Mr President , in stating the title of this report , you have already partly explained the content , or rather the object , of the Fiscalis programme .
I would briefly like to draw your attention to these amendments .
We for our part have tried to put everything into it .
We hope that not only the Commission present here but also the Council will do as much .
Finally , one particularly important change to be noted by the Luxembourg Presidency is that the European Parliament has finally been consulted on these actions in advance .
Besides the social prevention measures , I also recall a very delicate issue regarding the organization of financial crime : tax have ns .
A new balance should be sought from this angle and new means introduced .
I think that certain figures prove that concern about largescale , organized crime and widespread crime taking various forms is a prevailing concern among Union countries .
We are dealing with an organic measure and I wish to talk about three of its aspects .
Within the committee , we have sought to praise the role played by the Commission and Parliament and we have provided for several amendments , which are largely shared within the committee , to try and clarify some of the changes .
If we do not think there is any particular criminal phenomenon and there is no particular need to combat this particular phenomenon , we can continue to combat changing crime with antiquated systems , but we must realize that we will not be effective !
The motions put forward are fairly interesting and I think we will have to call upon Parliament to accept the invitation offered by a very large majority of the Committee on Civil Liberties which is seeking to take a step forward towards the European Union and the whole of Europe campaigning against organized crime , to prevent undesirable forms of it infecting the whole of Europe .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I do not think there is a single lunatic in Europe who can say that the Mafia does not exist .
We too want a balance , with the full individual guarantee of rights of defence , such as the direct relationship between criminal fact and accused , something that some are beginning to deny .
Our group obviously cannot vote for this report proposing a highly convenient way of shuffling off the real problem , which is one of drugs and drugs trafficking that today represents 80 % of the organized crime business .
A common measure needs to be taken as a matter of urgency indicating the path of our commitment to answering the challenges of the third millennium .
Mr President , organized crime has a great capacity to adapt to the situations to increase its trade .
Mr President , I would like to make a few brief remarks on the valuable work carried out by the rapporteurs who have diligently illustrated their work .
The first thing I would like to point out is how subjects of this kind , particularly the approach we give them , are directly connected with more general questions we dealt with yesterday , during the debate on the decision to be made on the Treaty of Amsterdam .
I wish to mention three : the first affects us directly and is the fight against Community fraud .
These are the three major issues on which we can work with a little more courage , even than in the important work carried out by the rapporteurs .
It should be recalled , however , as pointed out by our rapporteur and then taken up by Commissioner Gradin , that there is a weakness in identifying the causes and all the strategies of prevention .
Mr President , Mrs Colombo Svevo is right and I want to say the same : an honest and balanced answer , a virtuous course that begins this morning , a course of cooperation between Parliament , the Council and the Commission .
For this reason , I think it is inappropriate and wrong to include this issue in a framework which needs to remain organized , honest and balanced , as Mrs Colombo Svevo says
