, where it has been transposed , has not been incorporated into their legislation but is regulated by means of agreements between the social partners which are often then disregarded by one of the partners , as has been shown by recent events which , moreover , have been debated in this very House .
However , I am not in favour of imposing on the States , the individual Member States , solutions which involve employees in management decisions , on the basis , in some cases , of joint management models which are foreign to the legal and economic traditions of many European countries , as has just been said .
Mr President , when the experiment of the Luxembourg procedure was set in motion in 1997 and guidelines for Member States ' employment policies adopted , it was in the conviction that a favourable climate of economic growth might not alone be sufficient to ensure automatic positive results in employment .
There must be consistency with budgetary policies at Member State level and at local and regional levels as well ; there must be quality employment objectives seeking to combine flexibility , social dialogue , protection , rights and safety , but which also extend beyond that context to include lifelong training , integration policies and employment with a view to increasing the productivity of less elderly workers .
Report Jensen ( A5-0319/2001 ) :
The pensioners would be happy to know that there is a report addressing the issue of more information and consultation for pensioners , for it is still the case today that some European pensioners do not even know how large their pension will be the day before they start to draw it , they do not know at what age they will be able to retire and they find the documents presented to them totally incomprehensible .
I therefore hope that I will soon be able to vote in favour of consulting and informing pensioners as well as employees .
Indeed , I have just returned from a visit of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy to Slovakia , where we saw the progress made by this country in environmental matters , and I have to say that we were all happy campers , Mr President .
But Mr President , which was the dream : the fact that my daughter Cristina had graduated in law or the fact that we had , at last , succeeded in establishing the European lawyer , with a EUR 2 000 prize , which is what should happen in Europe ?
I voted for the report but I was unsure about one thing : I remembered that Neapolitan shoeshine , that penniless Neapolitan boy who , when he met a wealthy old industrialist in Ischia , was told : " When I was your age , I used to clean shoes instead of sitting here sunbathing .
The sum set aside for the ten remaining months of the ECSC budget is sufficient , and the increased appropriations for research are in line with the forecasts for after the Treaty ' s expiry .
I endorse Mr Virrankoski' s reasons for his choice and , in particular , I endorse the European Union ' s decision to contribute practically to creating safe conditions in the wake of the 1986 disaster .
The report she is tabling today and upon which we are to vote tomorrow shows that Parliament has focused on the most important points , which will improve the common position , in order to achieve the adoption of the amendments to the directive with all speed .
The Socialist Group will vote for all the amendments adopted in committee .
For precisely this reason , we need not just to ensure that a woman has the right to resume her job when maternity leave comes to an end but , in order to genuinely protect working mothers , we need to be able to provide them with more flexible legislation on parental leave , allowing fathers to benefit from paternity leave too so that they can attend to the child during its first few months of life .
On the basis of emergency legislation agreed at Community level , the European Union froze over EUR 100 million of assets of people suspected of terrorism .
From the very start of my term of office , one of my Commission ' s objectives has been to consolidate Europe ' s influence in the world .
A common policy is not , of course , the same thing as a single policy uniformly adopted by every Member State .
A common policy ensures that the different national policies are co-ordinated within a Community framework according to the Community method so that they serve the interests of the Union as a whole .
Secondly , we need specific institutional mechanisms for taking policy decisions .
The time has come to make new moves in our Mediterranean policy .
The results we have achieved so far have not been altogether satisfactory , though this has not always - or rather has often not - been our fault .
I also believe we should be ready to respond to the renewed signs of interest in joint action on shared goals - such as the fight against AIDS - coming from countries like Libya .
At the same time , we must work harder to offer the world ' s poorest regions a genuine chance of sustainable development .
The European economy was clearly slowing down even before 11 September .
Secondly , our programme .
On the basis of this , I conveyed to the European Council two messages .
Madam President , Prime Minister , ladies and gentlemen , this is a time for the greatest possible unity , determination and resolution
