The common position provides for an exception for pollutants from diffuse sources .
Sampling procedures must be improved , and the wording of the instrument as a whole must be tightened in order to close loopholes that the Member States might exploit and to ensure that the whole directive is not watered down .     Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , let me begin by expressing my thanks to Mrs Klass for her good work in connection with both readings of this draft directive .
That is precisely what we have been discussing from such diametrically opposed positions here .
I believe that floods are truly a major environmental issue ; we need only turn on our television sets to realise that they are happening more and more frequently .
If we do create this European regulatory framework , however , we must still place special emphasis on the subsidiarity principle .
One thing must , in any case , be clear : if we have to adopt a directive , it must take account of the Member States’ previous efforts .
There were loud calls for European assistance at that time .
I would like to pick up on two of these , namely the rapporteur’s call , which we have also been making , for this directive to be closely linked with the Water Framework Directive , because we are convinced that effective flood prevention and management can only be achieved if the aims of this directive are consistent with those of the Water Framework Directive .
The three-step approach we have outlined is logical : assessment of cross-border risks , compiling of flood maps and preparation of contingency plans for effective risk management .
Yes , the problems are man-made to a great extent .
The Commission will endeavour to encourage the Member States and the relevant business sectors to take coordinated action in order to exploit this potential to the full .     . — Mr President , I concur with the previous speaker , Mrs Vincenzi , and also believe that the Commission , given a large portion of good will , can do a fair bit of coordinating , even though the Constitution is not yet in force .
I should  ...     . – Mr President , Commissioner Potočnik , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to start by congratulating our rapporteur on his excellent handling of an extremely difficult task .
Yet it can bring Europe forward only if we manage to turn invention into innovation – and of course Mr Buzek has cooperated very closely with us in this regard , on ensuring that our research and innovation framework programmes overlap , and on ensuring that more products , more services and more licences originate in Europe .
Regarding embryos as exploitable material risks opening the ethical floodgates .
The Research Council has been given substantial resources – we are talking about an annual budget of approximately EUR 1 billion – and , in view of this , I believe that we need to set up a body to ensure transparency .
This Amendment calls for EU funding for research that includes destructive research with human embryos .
If , however , there is one important field to which we must give absolute priority , it is the field of safety and security : safety with regard to plants , and security in the sense of creating all the technical and other possibilities for preventing proliferation for non-civil purposes – military or even terrorist .
Other economic areas in the world show considerably higher rates of increase in research spending , which means that we are going to fall still further behind in comparison with those areas .
We must support that , and we must find a way of giving these businesses more support .
Under Parliament 's Rules of Procedure , ladies and gentlemen , this matter must be put before us again and again until we , as Parliament , reach a definitive decision on it .
The EU must give a good example in such matters and , for example , provide greater support and encouragement for organic farming .     – Mr President , the greatest threat that is repeatedly brought up in connection with bird flu is the appearance of a new virus sub-type that can be transferred from one human to another .
There can be no successful modernisation of the state apparatus , of the economy and of the armed forces if there is a lack of will on the part of the government and of interest on the part of the predatory capitalists who are only after profit with dirty money .
I believe that energy policy is certainly one area in which we have to say , loud and clear , ‘yes ’ to cooperation with Russia , but ‘no’ to dependence on it .     – Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , to describe Russia as an important and significant partner is not merely formulaic , for it currently holds the presidency of the Council of Europe and of the G8 , and it is also very much in our own interest that we should develop a strategic partnership with it commensurate with its own mass and of the energy and other raw materials that it possesses , not to mention its geographical position .
I am very positively struck by the breadth of his concept of information collection and also of transparency .
In every specific situation , decisions must be reached on a case-by-case basis , on the basis of whether or not criminal law provisions are needed in order to achieve this objective , or whether it ought to be left to the Member States to decide these matters and regulate them .
We should not , at a stroke and once and for all , deny ourselves an option
