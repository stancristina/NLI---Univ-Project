to the broad economic policy guidelines .
It in fact relates to two amendments , Amendments Nos 16 and 18 , which quite rightly stress the importance that we must give to services of general interest , in terms of their contribution to social and territorial cohesion of the Union , and their ability to create jobs .
I fully support the idea that this principle should apply to the food industry , which supplies food to millions of consumers .
Very much the opposite in fact .
They aim to improve protection of European consumers against microbiological risks from food products .
My group also supports the principle of including vegetables within the scope of the directive .
Mr President , in order to give some substance to EU-US dialogue , which brings together two partners with very different competences , we should focus the dialogue on the areas where we have similar responsibilities .
I am also pleased to note the support for developing research into rare illnesses .
We suddenly find out that it is in the best interests of the EU to take an interest in this matter .
Which is the more important for democracy ?
If we achieve this , the UN declaration will be perfectly acceptable , because it creates a political framework which forces everyone to decide to take action .
This extremely dangerous policy is one that the Likud is stating in its resolutions and one that Sharon is exercising on the ground .
High Representative , along with other Members of the House , we went to celebrate Europe Day in Jerusalem , to celebrate a day of peace .
These are the legitimacy and the security of the Israeli State and the need for the Palestinian people to own a State .
What is worse , unlike the President of the Commission , who clearly explained his views on this subject , the Council has not formally protested against the UN Secretary-General 's withdrawal of the investigation team into the Jenin massacre .
As for the Council , it has been carrying out its own reflections , initially on the basis of a report whose recommendations , made in 1999 , have not yet been followed up .
We have two options : one option which , in order to stabilise the presidency , assumes that the Treaties will have to be amended , and another option which would not require any such amendment .
That resolution also condemned the present institutional drift away from the Community method , as well as numerous instances of the malfunctioning of working methods and of the way in which the Council operates .
It possesses a legitimate power of decision .
Those paragraphs of the Treaties not included in the Constitution would remain applicable but would no longer form part of primary legislation .
In order to do this , we propose that a mechanism should be retained , such as Article 308 , but that it should be made to work in both directions : transferring competence to the Union or returning it to the Member States in the case of issues for which the national dimension has become predominant once more .
As a final precaution a review clause is proposed , modelled on Article 308 , so that more competences can be added if necessary .
I share his ambition to give more powers to the Union so that it can cope with its responsibilities and with what is expected of it .
The Union must have its own competence in matters involving economic policy , and it must have a redefined framework for the coordination of national policies , as well as fiscal harmonisation of the budgetary and revenue tools .
This abstract technical bias leads to erroneous federalist solutions which have a negative effect on democracy .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I shall try to make use of these few minutes of 'time out ' in this very late debate , which , incidentally , coincide , as I said to Mr Mendez de Vigo , with the last two minutes of time out in the famous football match that he mentioned .
According to my information , Real Madrid are still leading two - one , and their second goal was scored by Zidane .
It is therefore proposed that we should adopt a true Constitution of the Union , bring the second and third pillars within the Community sphere , make a clearer distinction between legislative work and executive work , establish a hierarchy of standards and define the relevant instruments better .
The question of strengthening controls to ensure that the division of competences between the Union and the Member States is respected forms a part of the most complex problems that we shall have to tackle .
Is it a pacifying role , opening up the way to a dialogue with Iraq , or is it a detonating role ?
The proof of this are the numerous , practical aspects that the FP6 contains , such as human/social research , principles of integrating environmental issues , sustainable development , improved mobility , equal opportunities , the role of universities and higher education in general and openness to the world .
Trade legislation , the rules of international trade and rules on investment must therefore be made subject to sustainable development criteria , and not the other way round .
This is what I wanted to say , Mr President .
Developing food crops and fundamental public services , particularly in the areas of health , education and social protection , is the most likely way that poverty will be reduced because it will create jobs in rural areas .
Floods and ecological catastrophes are becoming ever more frequent ; desertification is gathering pace , and it is against this background , with time running out , that we will go to Johannesburg in September
