Taking into account the breaks in the sitting , this debate lasted less than two hours .
I am thinking of the criticisms regarding the non-integration of the EDF into the general budget - criticisms which concern only the legal framework within which the funds are managed .
The ARE Group 's decision to vote against granting the Commission discharge in respect of the implementation of the European Development Funds for the 1994 financial year is based on the following two reasons : the annual report of the Court of Auditors and the detailed arguments of both the rapporteur and the draftsman of the opinion make it abundantly clear that the way in which the EDF appropriations were utilized does not correspond to any rule of sound management ; -furthermore , and this is the main reason , the European Parliament is called upon to grant discharge every year , even though it possesses neither the corresponding budgetary nor legislative powers : by supporting a discharge procedure of a purely accounting nature while not , at the same time , having the power of budgetary authorization , we are consenting to a confusion of powers which is prejudicial to Parliament 's political authority , in the sense that we are agreeing to carry out a legal exercise which is not in keeping with our mandate .It is for this reason that I and my colleagues are reiterating our call for the EDF to be incorporated into the general budget .
Poggiolini report ( A4-0051/96 ) Firstly , I should like to pay tribute to the rapporteur for his efforts to explain and shed light on Alzheimer 's disease - a little-known illness which nevertheless represents a veritable health scourge which must be eradicated .
I have already had an opportunity - yesterday evening , in plenary - to express my support for the Commission communication and Mr Cabrol 's report .
Similarly , we support all measures aimed at improving the Community 's selfsufficiency in blood and blood products by encouraging voluntary , unpaid , anonymous donation , in particular through the information , education and motivation of the public , support for voluntary blood donor associations , the promotion of cooperation between the Member States and the holding of a European blood donation day .
It is not good for this situation to continue .
And , to cap it all , the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference will have to wait until after the general election is held in the United Kingdom !
It is at the root of both the relocations which are leading to the rise in unemployment in the Member States , and the increasing pressure to reduce wages and even the purchasing power of the mass of workers .
The Europe of the Maastricht Treaty - with its rationale , its working methods and its policies - is a machine designed to crush peoples and nations in a kind of historic , cultural , social and economic revisionism , which seeks to impose on the real Europe - rich in the culture of its peoples and nations - a single , reductive and destructive model .
Because if it is difficult to take decisions unanimously in an organization with 25 members , it is unacceptable to take decisions by majority in an organization with 25 disparate members .
The establishment of economic and political cooperation undoubtedly requires efforts on everyone 's part , but we cannot oblige the applicant countries to adjust their structures and legislation to comply with the Maastricht Treaty without taking into account the possible economic and social consequences , and without allowing them express their views .
Moreover , this was the subject of one of our first pamphlets .
The majority of the élite were wrong .
In my view , this is no more than a smoke-screen put up by the nuclear lobby - of which Electricité de France , Framatome and Siemens form part - which wishes to sell reactors to Russia and other former Soviet republics .
At present - and this is the Council and the Commission 's message , one which is perhaps a little disappointing , but nonetheless real - we have the G7 's memorandum of understanding .
The first has already paid for his courageous commitment to peace with his life , and the position of the second is now being weakened by the new situation in the region .
Similarly , we are entitled to call on our American partner , the United States Government - whose opinion , we know , counts for a great deal with the Israeli Government - to play a mediating role .
It is for this reason that , whilst deploring the human tragedy currently being played out in the Middle East , we retain the hope that the peace process will not only be resumed , but extended .
Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , the events of the last few days in Lebanon fill us with dismay , since they are threatening the peace process which we have welcomed from the start .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , once again , Lebanon is being battered and bruised in a war which the two rival powers in the region are waging on its territory .
Should we really be surprised ?
Commissioner , I shall be very brief in order to allow my other colleagues time to speak .
On the other hand , even if the principle of comparative assessment contained in Article 9(5 ) is approved - which would be a positive step - it does not automatically follow that substances which are more harmful to the environment and to health would automatically be rejected .
