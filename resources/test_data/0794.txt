Concerns still exist but I believe that Council , Commission and Parliament have struck the right balance between the need to protect public policy and consumers and at the same time promote and support the growth of e-business .
I therefore strongly recommend that Parliament endorses and adopts Mrs Palacio ' s report , which represents a common position .
We do this in the full knowledge that the e-economy is evolving at a rapid pace .
We are witnessing in the 21st century the equivalent of the Industrial Revolution .
That means , as policymakers and institutions , we are still navigating our way through uncharted terrain .
We need therefore to continue , as Mr Harbour said , to have a full consultation and debate on both the outstanding and arising issues for business and consumers .
In particular , this is the case given the global nature of e-commerce .
We have in this directive an article which allows us to do that .
Article 21 of the common position provides for a review and we should use the time until then to deepen and further our knowledge on this critical sector of the European economy .
I would warn against complacency .
We need to continue to consult with interested parties in this debate and we need to ensure that the result is a national legislation and that we produce clear , appropriate and speedy legislation .
Mr President , I warmly welcome the extension and modification of the Food Aid Convention and thank the rapporteur for her work on this report .
The Commission proposal comes in for some criticism from the Budgets Committee in that there is no complete financial statement .
I have to say , with the fluid nature of food aid it must be extremely difficult to project accurate financial figures .
Now that the scope of aid has been widened , quite rightly in my opinion , from just cereals , this would be even more difficult .
I am particularly pleased to read in the new Convention that least-developed countries and low-income countries will be given priority when food aid is being allocated .
I am also pleased to see stronger provisions for promoting local agricultural development and local purchases as this also assists local economies and encourages local agriculture .
There are now many areas of sub-Saharan Africa where , unless there is a dramatic climate change for the better , it is unlikely that food will ever grow again .
I am thinking particularly of areas where the desert is literally burying the productive land .
We are now seeing in Ethiopia an even more desperate situation , where food aid is being provided but there is no water to cook with .
This is an issue that will have to be addressed in the future .
Water will become more valuable than oil in future in developing countries .
It is also good news that the new Convention covers transport costs and associated operational costs .
Even if again this comes in for criticism from the Budgets Committee , it is not much good delivering food aid to a country ' s ports if you cannot then distribute it to the remote areas by truck or by air to the people starving and in need .
There is no doubt that past programmes have had a beneficial effect where they can be carried out and the fact that sub-Saharan Africa has a steady and worryingly increasing problem probably reflects the instability in many of these countries caused by war .
This has increased the number of refugees dramatically and worsened the problem of providing food aid .
The continuous need for an international , legally binding framework which defines and provides the commitments and instruments for the delivery of food aid to the developing countries is obvious .
The extension of the Convention and the new rules that have been introduced must therefore be warmly welcomed .
Mr President , I also wish to congratulate the rapporteur .
Clearly from the comments that we have heard already , the global institutional arrangements intended to underpin food security , as recent experiences testify very clearly , need serious attention .
There is actually a loss of confidence in all forms of food aid except for emergency food aid .
Internationally negotiated commitments to tackle issues of food security problems are not , in my view , properly understood .
There is still an institutional resistance to radical reform of food aid policies .
This is summed up by the kind of tinkering on the edges which characterises the re-negotiated Convention .
The institutional Treaty-based arrangements for food aid are , in my view , still somewhat outdated and created with a world in mind where food aid was assumed to be a major feature of development and of humanitarian assistance and relief .
The arguments have already been made here this evening for compensatory financing , for aid to agricultural development , for export credits and for local sourcing ; all of these criteria , all of these priorities are very well understood .
Something people have not mentioned is that the European Union has actually gone further towards translating the understanding of these issues into action than any of the other donors , particularly for instance the United States .
We welcome the fact that in our food aid budget line we target food security issues and that budget provides financial assistance for food security .
That is very important indeed .
Clearly the challenge is to meet the needs of the hungry in the most locally sensitive way .
We need to see foodstock plans based on knowledge and transparency .
We need to have the knowledge of where the foodstocks are , we need to assess where they are and we need to access those foodstuffs when we have
