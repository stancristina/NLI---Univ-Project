First , I am also in this programme .
It was specifically for that reason that in July the Bureau of this Parliament decided to introduce a number of reforms .
It was clear from Klaus HÃ¤nsch 's initiative over a year ago that this was necessary .
The result of the whole operation should be that we ourselves have the courage to regulate our affairs convincingly and transparently .
The attacker came from a BMW and got away with a bag .
One of the visitors tried to stop him and was injured .
In some Member States no parliamentary immunity exists for anything said outside the parliamentary chamber .
I do not agree with him that it is the best possible result .
But countless other sectors , our European fashion houses , those who design equipment like telephones , computers and radios , are waiting for uniform European legislation .
Mr President , I can find no mention in the Minutes of the fact that yesterday I drew attention to an attack on a group of Dutch visitors in which one member of the group was injured .
Concrete objectives which can be monitored must be set at both European and national level with binding target dates .
That means that people must be given new opportunities to update their knowledge all the time .
But there also have to be schemes for part-time work , job rotation , sabbatical leave and so forth .
I hope they will be implemented as quickly as possible and I also call for special consideration for what I call social VAT , a reduction in the VAT on labour-intensive services .
That is not a dream , that is reality .
Mr President , you will notice that I have not so far said anything about the actual money .
However when I see the number of amendments there are , it looks as if some people are trying to drag the matter out .
Sometimes a different impression is given .
What we need to do now is come up with measures that actually do something to help the 18 million unemployed in Europe , despite the differences between the countries and the varying situations in the European Member States .
A standard must be established which measures the ratio of employed to unemployed in the three most successful countries .
It is better to review it again each year .
Because it is the only answer Europe can give to the 18 million people who are still unemployed at the moment despite Europe 's prosperity .
Since Mr Delors ' White Paper on growth , competitiveness and employment , not a single new idea has been put forward , let alone a start being made on implementing the existing proposals .
In my opinion Europe cannot in the long run avoid introducing a taxation system that does not tax the employment factor and goes further than the ecotax and energy levies we are already familiar with .
Spirit from the Member States , spirit from this Parliament and spirit from the European Commission .
There are problems about outlawing structural overtime .
Not only so that we continue to make use of the knowledge and experience of that generation and thereby encourage a flexible labour market , but also to make sure that pensions can be afforded in the future .
And after all that is also important .
I want to raise four points in relation to the proposals that we have heard this morning .
I believe that in fact it must be said that the only efficient way - as economic and monetary union has shown - is the convergence method , assuming that this is combined with a timetable .
We have produced enough ideas .
After all we have known for a long time , from our experience with monetary convergence , that such criteria are necessary if we are to move in the same direction .
In fact , as I see it , Eurobonds could be put back on the agenda in a Delors-style initiative .
According to the Amsterdam Treaty , Member States consider the promotion of employment as a matter of common interest , with the Community contributing to the achievement of a high level of employment , encouraging Member States to cooperate with one another , supporting and , where necessary , supplementing their actions .
( Parliament adopted the resolution )
On the two major reports , I compliment Mr Tillich and Mr Tomlinson for their reports .
We are now below 1.15 % , that is , 0.11 % lower than permitted by Edinburgh .
Dogmatism in the Council has been responsible for the simple issues of legal bases being beset by difficulties for too long .
It is for that reason that we have rejected the idea that behind every budget line there is a specific face .
On previous occasions we have already indicated that we would prefer an adjusted reduction or increase of the individual budget headings to an across-the-board reduction , whatever the result .
I would like to draw your attention to one and that is the amendment concerning B2-5122 , relating inter alia to aid to farmers who have been relegated to the sidelines by various political measures arising from agricultural policy .
The package is flexible , but clear enough .
I think we have produced a good budget and I want to thank the rapporteur in particular for that .
The information is still too much like propaganda for the federal model .
I want to talk about this Parliament 's credibility in a number of Member States .
We also think that the pension fund should be further examined and that the burden should shift from Parliament to the parliamentarians .
Expensive tenders which can cost thousands are thrown out because one little copy is missing and sometimes small and medium-sized businesses miss the
