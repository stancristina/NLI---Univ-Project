, there are some interesting new elements , but they are not enough .
Madam President , an issue has arisen in relation to the possible tabling of a resolution on the Nice European Council .
Madam President , we therefore believe that it is prudent not to table any resolution and to ask the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to prepare a report on the background to the issue , which can be debated at the right time when we know the facts .
In this case there is doubt and it is not clear .
How does that square with that same justification , which says that negotiations must be held within the World Trade Organisation ?
Therefore , there is really nothing new here .
This judgment has several questionable aspects but , accepting the judgment as it stands - since we have no choice , given that the court of Justice is the highest body qualified to interpret Community law - there is nothing to prevent this Parliament from declaring itself in favour of the proposed legal basis of Article 95 with Article 133 , and introducing the amendments to which I have referred , which include the rapporteur ' s amendments .
Nevertheless , I truly consider it to be unacceptable to interpret the differences in criteria with regard to the content of the proposal for a directive in terms of a supposed confrontation between the powerful interests of the tobacco lobbies and the common interest of protecting consumers .
It is therefore desirable that the efforts dedicated to these matters should increase .
Ladies and gentlemen , as you know , we live in a society in which there are ever-greater cross-border movements .
In the European Union , there is currently the paradox that the abolition of internal borders for the free movement of goods , people , services and capital has to live side by side with the maintenance of 15 national borders in the fields of police and criminal justice , which the Member States are making difficult to remove .
This is the first initiative that gives special attention and importance to the victim .
Ladies and gentlemen , because of what I have said previously , and in accordance with the provisions of Article 2( 4 ) of the European Union Treaty , which lays down that one of the objectives of the Union is to maintain and develop the Union as an area of freedom , security and justice in which the free movement of persons is guaranteed , we must ensure that this area of freedom , security and justice guarantees genuine access to justice so that the European public can benefit from suitable legal protection in any part of the Union .
To sum up , anyone who has been the victim of a crime must be guaranteed the same minimum level of treatment , their dignity should be protected , they should be guaranteed their rights to give and receive information , they should have access to justice and they should be granted compensation for the damage suffered immediately , effectively and in full .
Mr President , I regret very much that the Commission did not take all this into account before and did not inform us in sufficient time so that we could work on it in committee .
We asked what is was called and they said , " It is the unmentionable . "
What is more , of the thirty-eight revisions that the Community has had since 1988 , which is when this system was set up , twenty-odd have been annual revisions .
We agreed this between the Council and Parliament .
I wonder who will be the next victim ?
To be honest , I think that I have to recommend to this House that it approve the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument because , in short , it enables us to solve the Serbia issue and because it is a revision that no one is daring to call by its name .
Mr President , I would also like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Haug , for the magnificent work that she has done as the rapporteur responsible for the budget and for her efforts in dealing with the requests that the various committees have made .
However , this small quantity , which is essential for maintaining the activity of the sector and the economies of areas that are dependent on fisheries , is a very appetising snack , despite being small , each time we look at where to find money to fund new policies .
For now , Mr President-in-Office of the European Council , I can tell you what is on the Council web site , or at least what was on it at 10.00 this morning : the Treaty will be available when it has been approved .
It should be pointed out that , in principle , the aim of the Intergovernmental Conference was to improve the functioning of the Union in order to achieve enlargement .
If those institutions are weakened and the Charter remains outside of the Treaty , how are we going to bring Europe closer to its citizens ?
What was the point of eleven months of Intergovernmental Conference , two conclaves and countless meetings of the General Affairs Council ? ( Applause ) I would like to point out , by the way , Mr President-in-Office of the European Council , that this is paid for by taxpayers .
To conclude , Mr President-in-Office of the European Council , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , it is certain that , as far as the subjects of Nice that you yourself , Mr Chirac , pointed out - the European Company Statute , the Social Agenda , mad cow disease , maritime safety - there are sufficient causes to say that the Summit was a success .
