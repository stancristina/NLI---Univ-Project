Mr President , I congratulate both rapporteurs on their reports , which have received a high degree of consensus .
Today , the Council , Parliament and the Commission are bound by a signed commitment .
We must bear in mind the fact that in 1985 certain principles that are today considered to be fundamental were not incorporated , and at that time could not be incorporated into the text of the directive , because debate on the subject had not reached a sufficiently advanced level .
The directive does provide for this eventuality , but we must bear in mind the fact that judicial bodies are used to seeing this setting of compensation as interference by legislative authority in its duties and this issue must therefore also be reviewed .
Thirdly , renewable energies are characterised by the different situations from which the various Member States are starting , which means that any solution will have to adapt to these differences .
It is curious that we are slowly killing ourselves and yet the earth ' s contamination is not causing the alarm bells to ring .
Therefore , as long as public administrations continue to take responsibility for repairing the damage caused by thermal or nuclear power stations , we will be subsidising these sources of energy at the expense of renewables .
I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate my thanks to Mr Turmes for his work .
The ALTENER programme is enabling magnificent work to take place and Parliament has always been an ally of the Commission .
These would not be compulsory objectives , but ones which can produce results , at least from the political point of view , and I think that this would be a very important step .
I would also like to point out that our objective in all of this is to have a safer and more reliable supply of energy , which treats the EU' s environment with greater respect .
We obviously have to create a stable framework that will enable investors to make investments which require a sufficient number of years to cover their repayment .
We simply wish to be named in the guidelines , because what is not named does not exist , and fishing exists , and is even a common policy .
With regard to the distribution of resources , we have to take account of the need to show solidarity with countries which are highly committed to the question of refugees , but we also have to bear in mind - as the report says - the need for countries which have less of a tradition of accepting refugees - such as my own - to improve their infrastructures and services so that they may reach the same level as the other countries and take on - because I believe this should be the objective - higher levels of responsibility together with the other countries of the European Union .
Mr President , I welcome the two Commissioners who are most involved in the development of the budget , and I have no doubt that President Prodi will be present at the debate that will take place in two months time .
I can assure you that you will be able to reply in the affirmative to each of the cases which we are putting to you .
I will give you an additional piece of information .
This is a quality issue which will also have to be increasingly discussed in the context of this debate .
We want you to do so , and we understand that in that way we can support you so that you , who have just joined this Commission , can really control your house .
In all new legislation we must establish a better balance between 'self regulation ' and 'public regulation ' , in accordance with what , in the conclusions of the Lisbon Summit , in some initiatives , has been called coregulation .
We have to tackle that reform of the Treaty .
This marginalisation , and that of the African parliaments , demonstrated a considerable incoherence on the part of the organisers .
I am not impressed by the current pattern of African partners requesting aid in order to resolve their problems , as a result of which the European partners merely grant a part of that aid and little more .
It is historically significant because it is the first time that Europe , which was the colonising power and is responsible for the under-development and poverty of Africa , has met with the countries which are the consequence of that , the African countries which are seriously under-developed .
Are EUR 300m to be deducted from the items earmarked for agriculture funding to cover the costs of Kosovo ?
It does not surprise me that given this outrage the Commissioner responsible ...
Secondly , the commitment to international agreements .
In order to reform the Court it will be necessary to amend the Treaty , so that the Statute and the Regulations of the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance become operative .
We have renewed them three times , and we believe that the time has come to include the fundamental principles in the Treaty so that we will not find ourselves in legally dubious situations , such as the case of the meeting which I have just mentioned .
I will say the same thing here that I have said in my group : the debate is not whether we say yes or no to federalism .
We have to create a Treaty which gives rise to genuine European construction in which more than 400 million Europeans can share economic prosperity , a social dimension and a democratic life .
On behalf of the European citizens , we have to ask today not only for that fine-tuning
