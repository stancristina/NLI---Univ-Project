reversal of the trend in the future .
In order to give new impetus to growth in Europe , we must abandon the unrealistic objective of monetary union , and copy the examples of these small independent states , Norway or Singapore , which show that national independence and the conditions for growth are entirely compatible .
Our Assembly should therefore now take formal note , by a vote that we hope will be in favour , of its involvement in the process of funding reconstruction .
ECU 1 billion over five years which is a symbolic figure as the ECU 400 million and ECU 600 million have to be added together represents less than the average annual unused appropriations of the combined PHARE and TACIS programmes .
We have often been criticised for being inclined to discuss matters of little importance .
But the European Union does have enough weight to induce these authorities to respect , however minimally , the freedom of the citizens living in the zones they control .
What madness that is , when the same causes produce the same effects !
I raised the matter this morning with President Dini , then with President Santer .
Measures relating to free movement and those relating to the security of external frontiers should be applied simultaneously .
I should like to emphasize in passing that Europe will always be mutilated as long as it excludes Russia , and for the very simple reason that the present Europe is increasingly becoming a privileged space for economic and cultural colonization by the United States .
Now , you have a leading part to play .
But we should not conclude from that that it was the USSR that was preserving Europe from the atomic threat .
Mr President , the Arias Cañete report on fishing problems in the North-Western Atlantic area comes before us at a time when it could hardly be more topical , since the Euro-Canadian declaration which should have been adopted by the Council last week is still under examination today .
We know , too , the role that we need to play in reestablishing dialogue between the countries of that part of the world , a dialogue which may enable terrorism to be eradicated and democracy instituted throughout the region .
It is a pity , though , that this solicitude did not put in an appearance earlier , five years ago , when a number of States in the former Yugoslavia expressed the desire to gain independence and sovereignty .
At this parting of the ways , there are two roads open to us .
Demonstrations have been suppressed , and intellectuals are once more being prosecuted before the courts .
To pursue this aim , there are hundreds of people , thousands of people , in the Member States who are giving what they can spare , certainly , but are also giving of themselves to help those children .
And so they forget the reasons that lie at the origin of their union and they forget , too , and more importantly in my view , that this self-styled policy has a price - the liberty and democratic rights of 1 , 200 million people , whether they be Hans , Uygurs , Tibetans , Mongols or Manchus .
In order for that to happen , our Governments would have to take specific action to obtain a commitment from Indonesia to respect international law , the more so since East Timor is under the sovereignty of a Member State - Portugal .
I am looking for their banners , their streamers , and I see nothing at all .
Mr President , allow me to reply in person to the somewhat provocative remarks of our young colleague .
So , Mr President , when are we going to see an arms embargo ?
Let us start by regulating and legalizing all drugs , now .
That society represents both an opportunity and a danger for the States of the European Union .
It is not a handicap but a wealth , something which it is important to preserve , respect and encourage .
Among these quality sparkling wines are the crémants ; some of them are produced here in Alsace , an area that many of you know and appreciate .
New producing regions can also be welcomed into the fold , but on the following conditions : strict compliance with the wine-making method and the quality specifications which Luxembourg and France imposed on themselves , the essential need to associate the term with a particular producing area and with traditional vine varieties , with limited yields ; and reservation of the term 'crémant ' to areas which are already authorized to produce quality sparkling wines and which will be able to respect and master the strict winemaking conditions .
The cooperative cellar at Arques , for example , produces 6 million bottles and serves more than 500 producers .
If he has really read the report and the basic regulation , what he fears cannot happen , provided he votes for our carefully thought out amendments .
And , if I may , I should like to make a few comments on the amendments that have been tabled .
My reason here is the statement that the term 'producer ' defines the operator who undertakes the complete production of the product .
I fully approve of that amendment , and recommend you to vote in favour of it .
Their aim would be to make 'crémant ' a manufactured product of constant quality , irrespective of any typical features associated with region , vintage or harvesting and winemaking conditions .
It will not be a straightforward yes or no , because the problems are more complex and cannot be answered with a simple affirmative or negative
