Unfortunately , the current economic and social choices of the European Union widen the social gap , instead of bridging it .
The prospect of the integration , in coming years , of Bulgaria and Romania into the Union is positive , insofar as it is based not simply on satisfying certain indicators , but on real improvements to the life of the citizens in these countries .
We could , of course , play this part much more efficiently if the Cyprus question had been resolved when we joined the European Union on 1 May .
It is an expression of insecurity , it is an expression of anxieties about the workability of the solution and we would like the European Parliament to turn its attention in this direction and make a positive contribution towards putting those preconditions in place that will result in the support of the overwhelming majority , of both Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots , for the reunification of the island , within the framework of a federation .     – Madam President , I believe that enlargement should mainly be a procedure of resetting and renewing the objective of a Europe of democracy , solidarity and peace .
Secondly , let us not forget that the resolution of the Cyprus question will contribute to the security and stability of and peace in the wider area of the Middle East , which is suffering acutely following the military invasion by the United States of Iraq and the continuing policy of Sharon , who refuses to respect the rights of the Palestinian people .     – Madam President , first I should like to thank everyone who contributed towards the integration of the Republic of Cyprus into the European Union and to say that Cyprus , which has battled and fought hard for freedom , justice and , above all , solidarity between peoples , is becoming a member of the European Union , which has these as its principles and objective .
We shall make every effort , as quickly as possible , to achieve it .
As regards the so-called embargo mentioned earlier for the Turkish Cypriots , and which never existed on the Greek Cypriot side , we believe that our Turkish Cypriot fellow countrymen , who for us are equally European Citizens , with all the rights which derive from the integration of Cyprus into the European Union , certainly need to be strengthened economically .
We assure you today that we shall repay it with the positive role of our contribution and our consistency towards what we call a Europe of all the peoples , a strong , powerful Europe , a Europe of prosperity , security and stability .
They could not create this feeling , if you think – and you must understand us – that our people , in their course through history , were only without an occupying army , without foreign troops , without suffering invasion and abuse of their human rights , from 1960 to 1974 .
I believe , however , that history will not gainsay us and will confirm the political and historic values of this promising step of recent enlargement by Europe .
Today we are acquiring new neighbours , with a positive perception , with an expectation of hope towards the European Union on the part of citizens and politicians alike .
The Baltic States and the former central and eastern European countries to the other Europe , Malta to Africa and the Mediterranean and Cyprus to the eastern Mediterranean and beyond .
I hope , as does everyone else who supported the Annan plan , as does the European Parliament , that it will help to bring about positive developments for the reunification of the island .
Once again , as a Greek , welcome dear Cyprus .     .
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I too wish to express my joy that enlargement is now a reality .
The European social model is designed to secure a high level of social protection , education and social dialogue , based on good economic performance .
As far as the European economic model is concerned , the Treaty makes provision for the application of an economic policy based on close coordination of the economic policies of the Member States .
The methods used include exchanging information , discussing best practices , engaging in policy-making dialogue , drafting jointly agreed rules and policy objectives and taking jointly decided action .
Many of the constituent components of the economic coordinating framework are closely linked to the general Lisbon strategy , a strategy of structural reforms with economic , social and environmental dimensions .
The decentralisation of policy-making procedures gives the national authorities the necessary room for manoeuvre , allowing them both to apply policies in keeping with national economic structures and preferences and to adapt to the economic developments noted in each individual country .
Its main objective is to ensure that economic growth comes up to its real potential .
Now , what constitutes the European social model ?
The European social model , in the various forms in which it appears in the Union , has played a vital role , contributing to the constant increase in productivity and uninterrupted improvement in the social level in the whole of the Union , while at the same time ensuring that the benefits are as widespread as possible .
The Social Policy Agenda plays a most important role in the updating of the European social model .
The inclusion of competitiveness at the World Economic Forum , at which European countries such as Finland , Sweden and Denmark clearly have leading positions , clearly emphasises the vital importance of this interaction .
Updating the social model means developing and adapting it , so that account is taken of the fast changes taking place in the social economy .
Solidarity without competition would
