Where is the EU when people take flight from the abominable dictator described by my fellow MEP , Mr Evans ?
Why , just as my fellow MEP Mr Cohn-Bendit said , do we not support democratic movements in Iran ?
European history from 1930 to 1939 is the history of a Europe that , step by step , gave in to Hitler 's expansion and aggression .
Today , the Chamberlains of our own time say that Saddam Hussein can be disarmed by the weapons inspectors .
If that is the case , why was this not done long ago ?
We also forget that the weapons that threaten the world outside Iraq , and that we wish to remove , are not the same weapons used to oppress the Iraqi people .
The war against Saddam Hussein must be a war of liberation .
Democracy and economic development are the only protection against terrorists but , in the twelve years since the weapons inspections began , the EU 's efforts have been designed to secure our peaceful coexistence with the dictator .
As long as we only have words to offer , we are powerless .
The Commission 's representative - Mr Bolkestein , I believe - mentioned at one point the issue of whether Parliament might not take a positive view of the Commission 's actions .
The idea of doing so strikes me as being something of a bad joke , since such energetic kow-towing to unreasonable demands on the part of the American authorities has rarely been seen .
What we are discussing here and now bears no direct relation to the use of military technology to kill other peoples , but it is all part of the same picture .
The demands put forward by the American Government are clearly inconsistent with the legal requirements derived from current legislation , first and foremost Directive 95/46/EC on the principles of data protection .
As is apparent from quite a few of the statements put forward by the Article 29 Group , the heart of the matter is that this data is not merely to be used in the interests of air safety , but for the purposes of what is referred to in the United States as public order , that is to say as a component part of the United States ' war against terrorism conducted under the banner of the end justifying the means .
What is described in the paper from the Article 29 Group is certainly alarming .
It is , then , no longer specifically protected , as it ought to be according to American legislation .
The question , raised by the Commissioner , was as to whether this matter could be sorted out using a comitology procedure .
In my view , the matter necessarily revolves around an agreement pursuant to Article 24 - cf . also Article 38 - of the Treaty on European Union , which unfortunately means that Parliament is made redundant since it has no influence upon decisions of this kind .
I should like first of all to thank Mrs Gröner for the sterling work she has done .
As one has come to expect with Mrs Gröner 's work , there was a long and thorough process leading up to this debate .
Mrs Gröner refers to Article 2 and Article 3( 2 ) of the EC Treaty and to Article 23 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights , all of which emphasise the EU 's obligation to promote equality and remove inequalities between men and women .
I am in no doubt at all that this is particularly aimed at the Member States , but it is in actual fact a principle that ought also to apply here in the European Parliament , for equality will not be achieved until both the political will is present and the appropriate tools are in place .
Once , the debate revolved around women 's freely choosing to create equal opportunities .
Now , it is increasingly the case that men and women have become equal under the law , and it must therefore be up to women themselves to discover what they want .
This , however , is to ignore the facts .
The last example shows how worthwhile it can be making active efforts to promote women 's participation and how it is possible to bring about more equal representation , either through quota arrangements on the individual lists or through the option of preferential elections .
One such indirect system is the European Convention , only 17 % of whose members are women , and an example of a hierarchical system is the administration of the European Parliament , which is also short on equality .
If we , as the number one democratic institution , cannot set a better example than we are able to do at present , how are we to be able to convince people in Europe that equality is a 'sine qua non' , or necessity , if we are to have a proper future in Europe .
In terms of equality policy , we have unfortunately begun far too late to focus upon money rather than upon mere words .
In this area , the EU 's Structural Funds are its handiest tools for redistributing resources , firstly between the regions and secondly between population groups .
As both Mrs Avilés Perea 's report and analyses by quite a few women 's organisations show , however , the gender dimension has not , as Commissioner Diamantopoulou pointed out , been anything like adequately incorporated .
Another issue is that , when we address one of the major challenges for the EU - namely enlargement - we shall be faced with still greater challenges in the area of equality .
The Communist regimes considered the oppression of women as something peculiar to capitalist
