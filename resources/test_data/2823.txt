In Spain , for example , practically all flax grown is short-fibre flax , since the heat and the lack of rainfall restrict the growth of the plant .
However , the thing that seems least appropriate to me is the proposal on processing aid .
Neither does there appear to be any precise calculation to justify the maximum guaranteed quantities , either at European level or on the different national levels .
It was important because South Africa is one of the countries which receives the most funding from the European Union for its development process .
Having examined the Council ' s proposal , the Committee on Development and Cooperation considered it necessary to try to prevent the negotiation being prolonged by a third reading .
During the previous five years the budgetary framework had been EUR 125 million per year .
We also hope that these proposals are acceptable to the Commission , despite the fact that theirs - 25 million for the commitology question and 850.5 million for the budgetary framework - are somewhat different to the ones that we are presenting .
I repeat : in principle , I would not be opposed , but I do not believe that Parliament is in favour of delaying the vote .
However , Mr President , we should take note of who is being pressurised and who really bears the responsibility for prolonging this process and taking it to a third reading .
Therefore , there is no uncertainty and no urgency and we can study this issue again , calmly , at a later date .
We will have to respond to the MEPs ' new obligations , as laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam , incorporate new technologies into our work and react immediately to the huge administrative , organisational and political obligations presented by enlargement of the European Union .
I am very glad that Mr Ferber has reacted to the report of the Court of Auditors on the funding of the political groups .
In OLAF' s judgement , it appears that it is not in the Structural Funds that fraud and bad management prevail .
I therefore believe that we should clearly separate objectives and not allow confusion to reign .
The creation of an effective and transparent office to fight fraud is a task with which all Members of this Parliament agree , and I hope that all the institutions agree .
It is not acceptable - since we all agree that we cannot continue to ask these young doctors to work these exhausting hours and that we cannot continue to put our patients at risk - that we have not been able to make speedier progress .
What will happen to humanitarian aid ?
The European Commission - like the fishing sector itself - has made significant efforts to iron out our differences .
If he does have it , I would like him to say so , but I understand from his second reply that he does not .
There are also other factors .
Budgetary consolidation itself , which is , of course , the reduction of the public deficit , gives each Member State room to act in adverse situations .
In your reply - or comment - I note two implicit questions .
This is an agreement adopted by the Council of Ministers as a result of initiatives by certain Member States and which I also support , since I believe that a good budgetary policy provides greater room for manoeuvre in the event of difficulties .
This would require a broader debate , focussing on the starting point , which is the development of economic forecasts and the real economies of each of the areas .
Therefore , despite a certain degree of concern - because that concern exists within public opinion - about the evolution of the euro , we believe that this situation will be corrected and that it should be considered to be temporary rather than permanent .
In any event , what I do believe - as I said earlier - is that the euro , at the moment , has an exchange rate which , if we analyse it in relation to its components and its historical situation , is not that different from situations which have existed at other times .
Therefore , allow me to make a rather more general comment .
I would also like to highlight , as a fundamental contribution to the consolidation of the progress made until now , the promotion and maintenance of rigorous regulations on health and safety at work , which has been one of the most prominent issues in the debate held in the Commission , which advocates better jobs in Europe .
Nevertheless , the political analysis of the Lisbon Summit reveals that there were two proposals : one which was more social , more committed , which came from the French Prime Minister , Mr Jospin , and the other , resulting from a previous agreement between Mr Blair and Mr Aznar , deregulating the labour market and making it more flexible .
Our concern has always been not only greater employment but also greater quality of employment .
However , this cannot be a political objective , as in Maastricht , because it does not depend on the will of the different governments or on a specific decision by each one of them .
Therefore , Commissioner , firstly , what active policies and which economic sectors do you intend to bring into play in order to achieve better education in this particular area , so that a sense of responsibility may be developed ?
On the first occasion , in December 1998 , this report on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from new passenger cars was approved at first reading with 48 amendments .
If we bear
