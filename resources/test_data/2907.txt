Today we have a clear explanation : you just have to look at the enormous gulf between the Council 's proposals and the views of 3 million doctors and all of Europe 's trade unions , representing 150 million workers .
We believe there are good reasons to take Parliament 's opinion on board .
In future , the opt-out would not be a temporary one-off exception but a permanent general rule and , what is more , it would be sanctioned in the name of freedom and social progress .
I also hope that , with the support and good offices of the Commission , we can then start conciliation and build a compromise acceptable to both branches of the legislature .
Watch out for the traps .
I have not talked to 160 million workers or 4 million doctors , but I have talked to their representative organisations .
( Applause ) It is true that some steps have been made towards making toys safe .
It deals with the recognition that arms and munitions also come under the internal market , though subject , of course , to a number of restrictions .
Mr Toubon has pointed out that this is in relation to other international texts .
These must , of course , include environmental criteria , such as land use and its repercussions in third countries , but I also think social criteria are crucial .
As with the rest of the climate change package , not everyone will find it wholly satisfactory , but it is something that everyone can accept .
It proved to be complicated at the beginning because of its implications , but they convinced us that it was worthwhile .
It is also significant that we have enhanced the controls .
Some of them now see it as something to brandish to stop this text progressing .
I can assure some of them that we have talked to the European data protection supervisor to ensure that personal data will remain totally confidential .
For that to happen , of course , the directive needs to be adopted .
It should see it as an opportunity to bring our agenda closer to that of the citizens .
Despite that , I voted for it , since that was the only strategic option to paralyse the Council 's directive and force it into conciliation .
We cannot have credibility around the world if the measures we adopt in the management of immigration , in particular , and in our policies in response to the tragic events caused by terrorism , are not exemplary in terms of human rights .
I fully share the rapporteur 's commitment in defence of human rights and his willingness to go a step further .
Social groups are sometimes disregarded or suffer discrimination for reasons of gender , sexual orientation , ethnicity , religion and so on .
Madam President , in the Commission 's proposal for a Small Business Act , it fully acknowledged the problems faced by small - and medium-sized enterprises .
This plan was supported and endorsed by the European Council last week .
An example is the agreement we adopted yesterday to raise the de minimis rule on state aid .
We sincerely hope that the banks and the credit system respond positively to this volume of aid and support , which is necessary now but of a size that would have been unimaginable only a few months ago .
The fact is that , when the banks rely on public money and public guarantees , they also have to comply with a number of conditions .
Taxpayers ' money is being risked to improve the operation of the financial circuits and the credit markets and circuits , and we are not prepared to allow it to be misspent or used without producing good enough results .
The second strategic review of the energy sector , adopted by the Commission , highlights the urgent need for the European Union to increase its investment in energy infrastructures in order to facilitate our energy policy objectives , which include security of supply , sustainability and competitiveness .
In addition , the European Investment Bank has committed significant increases of up to EUR 6 billion per year to finance investments relating to climate change , security , energy supply and energy infrastructures .
The Energy Council that has been mentioned , which took place on 8-9 December , adopted the Renewables Directive .
These astounding rises saw the price of a barrel of oil leap to nearly USD 150 in July and the prices of wheat , maize , rice and other raw materials soar to extraordinarily high levels , causing obvious social problems and raising price indices .
Indeed , we cannot rule out the possibility that in the middle of the year , in June or July , year-on-year inflation may even be negative , as a result of that sharp rise in oil and raw material prices .
In July , the real effective exchange rate of the euro against the rest of our partners ' and competitors ' currencies was extremely high , and there was a clear overvaluation of the effective exchange rate of the euro .
The second half saw prices plummet for a number of reasons , but mostly because of the economic slowdown and , in our case , the recession into which we are unfortunately sinking .
However , having for many years followed the communication from the ECB on the Thursday of the first week of each month , straight after its board meeting , I think it is quite easy to make out not only the decisions it makes , but also , without announcing them in advance , the market orientations and the manner in which it analyses its monetary policy for the coming months .
