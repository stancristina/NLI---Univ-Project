been here in writing today and , after having heard Mr Nielson ' s speech , I can well imagine that he is up against a lot of powerful opposition in the Commission .
Because the joint motion for a resolution proposes a range of effective mechanisms for ensuring coherence , I shall use the very short time allotted to me here just to mention one more such mechanism , namely obliging the Commission to carry out an evaluation of new , relevant legislation from this aspect .
The examples are , I hope , all well known .
In any case , they are known all too well to the producers in the ACP countries who are affected by these measures and who have to destroy their products because they cannot compete with EU-subsidised products .
European taxpayers contribute EUR 40 billion per year in support of agriculture in the EU.
Add to this the fact that the agricultural sector accounts for 34 % of the developing countries ' gross national product , compared with 5.3 % in the EU.
Why will neither the Council nor the Commission admit the fact ?
Mr President , I too should like to thank the Council and the Commission for their reports and , in common with others , express my regret at the fact that coherence policy has not been given more prominence .
I should therefore like to discuss something more general and begin with a couple of , in my view , useful figures .
In 1900 it was ten times higher and in the year 2000 it is 60 times higher .
On the contrary , it looks as if we have entered an exponential curve which is widening the gap still further .
This is shown by the following figures : the income gap between the richest and poorest fifths was 30 :1 in 1960 , 60:1 in 1990 and 74:1 in 1997 .
These figures are from before the Internet revolution took off .
In a global village , major discrepancies in the world will not , in the longer term , be tolerated by the poorest section of the village .
I would therefore urge the Council ' s Presidency to set the promised debate in motion as quickly as possible and , above all , to conclude it in such a way that we all of us , including the people of Europe , realise what globalisation means and understand that a central element will have to be radical changes in the nature and the level of the development aid we provide .
It may well be that others are worse , but that does not place us in any better a light .
As far as I could hear - but I may have missed something - the President-in-Office of the Council did not mention the word " trade " at all .
I would also ask the Commissioner to give some concrete examples of sectoral interests which are holding matters up , not only in the Commission but also in the Member States .
In that way , we should perhaps have a basis for discussion , instead of receiving proposals from all the governments and from all over the Commission , which is scarcely likely to produce results .
I shall conclude with a few words about the Internet revolution .
As Commissioner Liikanen keeps saying on his travels , we have a head start here in Europe in the area of mobile telecommunications .
This technology can facilitate that necessary quantum leap forward in development policy to which I referred and , in this connection , the EU can set the agenda , leave its mark on development and honour its global responsibilities .
.
We are nonetheless aware that we are concerned here with a sharing of powers between the Member States and the Community .
We are therefore voting in favour of the recommendation .
.
Basically , we are opposed to programmes and structural funds of this type but , since the vote is only concerned with how - and not to what extent - these resources are to be used , we have simply adopted a position on the issue .
We think it is important to guarantee equal opportunities for the groups discussed in the report .
This does , of course , contain a number of good observations .
Now , the concept of "uniform harmonisation " is one of those muddled expressions which totally obfuscates the integration process in question .
No-one would benefit from this type of harmonisation " .
Paragraph D points out that " the Union may provide added value by adoption of proper binding and effective convergence criteria " , and the report goes on to emphasise that the development of this convergence process is to be promoted by means of joint talks between the Ecofin Council and the Social Affairs and Employment Councils .
And , in this regard , we approach the heart of the matter .
Instead , it is an extension to the EU' s EMU project , which is of quite special interest to the three countries which remain outside EMU and can rescue themselves from the sinking ship , namely Great Britain , Sweden and Denmark .
It is therefore important for us to emphasise that we cannot support a proposal whose essential rationale is to extend the EMU project .
( DA ) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have voted today in favour of the report by our Swedish Social Democratic colleague , Jan Andersson , on the Commission ' s communication concerning a coordinated strategy for modernising social security .
The report states that modernisation does not mean a reduction in the level of social protection but , rather , better use of available resources .
No-one would benefit from this situation
