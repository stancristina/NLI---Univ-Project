I am sorry to say that , so far , the constitutional Convention has not sent us this message or this position .
If we are to be able to do so , we need public health to have an eminent position in the Treaty of the European Union .
We cannot talk of prevention , control and timely intervention with communicable or other diseases unless we put the conditions in place for Community cooperation , especially today with enlargement and with citizens able to travel easily and quickly .
The role of the World Health Organisation is fundamental , which is why cooperation between the WHO , the European Commission and the Member States has been effective .
Exit points must be controlled in the same way as - if not more so than - entry points , using all administrative and scientific means .
As I said , we know from the Commission and from Mrs Brundtland herself , who has a global view of the matter , that although it has been identified - and this is a fact - in record time compared with what has been done in the past and we have identified the molecular structure of the virus on the one hand ; on the other hand , however , no substantial progress has been made in the field of its natural history , in other words on how the virus is transmitted , and there is at present no visible progress on an efficient vaccine to prevent the disease or any anti-viral medication to treat it .
There has been a suspected - not a confirmed - case in Greece since yesterday , which is being investigated .
In all events , the fact is that there are also cases in Europe .
I listened to Mr Panella talk of the paradox , and it is indeed a paradox , that we have protection from zoonoses and no protection for human health .
Something like the Centre of Disease Control in the United States .
The text in general was the result of compromise .
The Commission and the Council recommended that there should at least be some sort of administrative - not public health or medical - control , as the Italian minister , Mr Sirchia insisted .
A great many topics were touched on .
A common compulsory information centre , as is the case now with the network for compulsory registration of all probable and possible cases is , I think , an important step because this will give us the epidemiological picture on the basis of which certain measures can be taken to deal with the situation .
On the other hand , there can be no doubt that we also need European research activity .
However , we need similar centres at regional level , such as the surveillance network of the European Union , to which we should report .
Mr President , these are oral questions .
It is that usually we run out of time and , in this sense , I should like to put my question , hear the Commission 's answer and proceed to the secondary question to which I am entitled under the Rules of Procedure .
Nonetheless , however , I have one query : the very title of the question mentions a matter to do with the budget .
Mr President , Commissioner , once again the European Parliament is being called on to address what is , without doubt , the most problematic of all the countries associated with the European Union under some sort of special relationship which , in the case of Turkey , goes as far as qualifying as a candidate country .
That is why the European Union and , more particularly , the European Parliament , as the elected representative body of its people , must severely and unreservedly condemn this new intolerable incident and the more general standard Turkish stance in the field of human rights and international law and make it perfectly clear to the Turkish Government that any thought of accepting Turkey into the bosom of the European family is out of the question under these circumstances , as the exceptional report by Mr Oostlander quite rightly emphasises .
I need only remind you of the armed raid on the previous president of the Association , Akin Birdal , who was repeatedly fired on .
As far as we are concerned , there can be no doubt that the government of Islamists , by reason of its very ideological base , was and is not in a position to lead Turkey towards democracy .
The raid was carried out on the basis of Articles 169 and 312 of the Criminal Code and the anti-terrorism law respectively , which criminalise any support for the hunger strike of political prisoners and their fight against the white cells as an act of terrorism .
Mr President , more than 10 years after the Commission 's attempt to create a suitable legislative framework to regulate the matter of the statute for a European Cooperative Society , the Council is today showing the political will to progress with and close the matter .
The arguments expounded by the Committee on Legal Affairs in favour of Article 95 are right , but it is also right to look at how relations between the European Parliament and the Council are going to shape up in the future .
In adopting them , we shall help to develop cross-border cooperative activities in the social work sector which , according to the more general strategy on employment in Europe , will constitute an important source of employment .
To be precise , the directive needs to take account of the three points that Mr De Rossa raises in his report .
It is also rightly proposed that , when electing workers ' representatives to supervisory
