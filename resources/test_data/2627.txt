Mr President , every day it is drawn to our attention that the environment is changing .
I therefore want to congratulate Mrs Schörling on a very good report which proposes that environmental aspects must be taken into consideration at an early stage .
It is a matter of urgency that economic activity should be included in the environmental assessment .
We must try to create a system in which we think in environmental terms from the very beginning , even when it comes to economic problems .
This is a major and important issue .
Mr President , after a fight lasting many years , we are now to take the crucial decision on reception facilities which will make it possible , for example , to leave waste oil in port instead of dumping it in the sea .
It also has to be said that what we have achieved today is a compromise .
In my view , it remains to be seen what effects this will have .
Mr President , first of all , I want to congratulate the rapporteur on a commendable result .
I should like to say , however , that the agreement is in certain respects a disappointment in the perspective of what has happened in the Baltic .
In the last few days , we have learned that , even when it comes to grey water and pollution which is eutrophic in its effects , intentional and unintentional discharges from vessels are the main sources of pollution in the Baltic .
However , it will be extremely important to follow up the proposal .
The family is our society ' s most important building block , and we must therefore stand up for the right to a family life .
As I say , thank you for your answer , but I should still like to ask a follow-up question .
A lot of people find it appalling that , here in Europe , there are riots , hooliganism , aggressive language and violence such as are unknown in connection with sporting events in , for example , the United States .
Perhaps next time , Portugal will also be in the final .
It has emerged that , in future too , Swedish citizens who are to travel within the Schengen area will have to carry their Swedish passports with them because Swedish ID documents do not state the country of which they are citizens , as required under the Schengen Agreement .
The fact that the result has turned out as well as it has is largely due to the tireless and committed work done by the rapporteur , Mrs Lienemann , whom we wish to thank .
The clearest proof of this is that the rules are binding , something which Parliament had demanded .
Crucial to how the directive will operate is the question of how it will be implemented and monitored .
Mr President , our group is quite satisfied with the result of the conciliation , even if there is always , of course , room for a little further progress .
What is worth noting , as far as the conciliation process is concerned , is the fact that Parliament has unfortunately slowed down this development towards manufacturer ' s liability instead of speeding it up .
It can be difficult drawing the line between undeclared and properly declared work .
That is the heart of the matter .
This subject has already been taken up in the debate .
Mrs Jöns observed quite correctly that in those regions and countries where the level of tax is fairly - or even very - high , where the labour market is well organised and where workers have strong unions , there is almost no undeclared work at all , at least not in any organised form .
I was quite shocked to read the rapporteur ' s original report in which she proposed that all employees in European workplaces should be forced to carry electronic cards so as constantly to be monitored by the authorities .
Improved wages are a much better remedy than lower taxes and other concessions to irresponsible employers .
The compromise contains retroactive measures , and we cannot back a legislative text which alters the rules retrospectively .
In the debate in the Chamber yesterday on cloning , I heard a number of people more or less clearly defending cloning for the purposes of medical treatment , on the grounds that this would be quite different from cloning for reproductive purposes .
Researchers throughout the world have said that Parkinson ' s disease and other serious illnesses can perfectly well be cured by other methods .
We must ask ourselves the most important question of all .
We cannot just content ourselves with this debate .
I am extremely pleased about the decision taken .
Civilisation and humanity show their character most clearly in the way in which they treat life when it is defenceless .
- ( SV ) We abstained from voting in the final vote on Mrs Lucas ' report .
We are firm opponents of these proposals .
Sports policy is a policy area characterised by its cultural context and framework and ought not therefore to be covered by the texts of the Treaties .
By turning sports issues into political issues , we do a disservice both to sport and to the idea of drawing the peoples of Europe closer together .
I also believe that the Bosman judgment has done very great harm to football and that the sporting community has every reason in the future to ask the European Parliament and the European Union to keep away from this area .
On the one hand , I am an old opponent of nuclear power and have for many years been a member of the board of the Swedish Nuclear Power Inspectorate .
Secondly , the same
