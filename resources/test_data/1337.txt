Given the higher growth rate than was predicted in the financial perspectives , which are based on 2.5 % growth , we can see our way forward to taking slightly different measures on budgets than we would otherwise have done .
On behalf of my group I would like to caution the Commission not to go ahead at this stage with shifting agricultural expenditure from category 1 to category 4 .
In Britain in particular we have a farming industry which is in desperate straits and wants to see some assistance given to certain sectors of agriculture : shifting money for agriculture from one part of the budget to another at this stage would be to give them a wrong message .
Lastly , a word of caution about the question of information .
This is what bedevilled the relationship between our Parliament and the previous Commission : the fact that we , under the Treaties , have access and the right of access to all information in principle .
It looks as if we are running into difficulties with our framework agreement .
I therefore stress that , if we want to have the Commission and Parliament working together , we have to be able to come up with a solution to this problem as soon as possible and not to have limitations on documents which are available to citizens .
As Mr Bonde rightly pointed out , we should have a European Union where there is a free flow of information from the bureaucracy to all our citizens .
Thank you , Mr Prodi , for your presentation and your documentation .
Congratulations on using the Internet for the general public - a very good idea .
I will start with trade .
We agree with you that we need a rules-based trading system .
It is essential .
Seattle failed because the United States , in particular , appeared unable to grasp the legitimacy of policies such as environmental protection , the preservation of rural communities through the common agricultural policy , animal welfare , health concerns and social rights .
It displayed incredible insensitivity to the legitimate concerns of the developing world and , frankly , the developing world has little so far to thank the WTO for .
We expect the European Union to continue negotiations , maintaining our strong positions on all these issues and using our links with countries in the developing world to ensure that the next round is a fair round .
Please , can we have detailed proposals in the next three months about how this will happen .
Innovation and knowledge - very appropriate for a new century .
How much innovation has taken place in the Commission , or indeed in the Parliament may I say ?
We had a White Paper on innovation some years ago - what has happened since ?
One thing I would like to say very strongly is that we are very concerned in follow-up , not simply in excellent communications , which we welcome , but in follow-up , follow-up , follow-up ! ! ! !
We have under way the Fifth Research Framework Programme - what has happened to what was learned in the Fourth ?
What is the dissemination for the new ideas , the new products , the new comparisons of socio-economic systems ?
Follow-up again , please .
We welcome incidentally the formation of a European research area which you and Commissioner Busquin have put forward .
This is an excellent way in which to begin the century .
I welcome the forthcoming communication on enterprise , but I hope that past work will also be looked at before we go ahead with more .
I will now use a tremendous clich√© truism - 'our greatest resource in the European Union is our people ' .
Is it not shameful that large Member States like my own and Germany cannot supply the number of people skilled in information technology ?
Is it not disgraceful that they are having to attract people from countries where those skills are needed ?
It is a disgrace and I hope that you will take it up when you look at legislation .
A further shocking waste of resources , Commissioner , is that women in technical , scientific and information technology fields are squandering their skills .
I hope there will be a follow-up to the Science White Paper .
Mr President , it is interesting that Mr Prodi has presented today a work programme ; however , our agenda says that we are having a debate on a legislative programme .
Looking at it from the point of view of social and employment policy we certainly do not have a legislative programme before us .
In fact we have not had a legislative programme for several years now .
What we have had instead is a process of consolidation and the development of certain convergence processes such as that developed and launched at Luxembourg .
We welcome the Luxembourg procedure .
We hope it will be deepened , strengthened and extended to other areas such as convergence in social protection .
But does that mean that we have done the job in terms of legislation in the social area ?
I think not .
There are a number of areas where we need to update and modernise the social legislation we have adopted in the past .
With the deepening and strengthening of the internal market and globalisation we are seeing an increasing number of mergers , take-overs and transfers within the European Union .
That , to me , says that we need to look back at the whole framework of legislation we developed largely in the 1970s in this area - on transfers , collective redundancies , insolvency , and latterly on works councils .
We need to modernise and strengthen that legislation , not in order to stop globalisation or the deepening of the
